Abstract

In complex plasmas together with single particle behaVior the study of collective phenomena

in large assemblies is an important development. We analyze the interaction among particles

in plasma in several cases, starting from Clusters consisting of a few particles up to large

assemblies. In some cases the formation of the self—built electric ﬁeld at the edge of the Cluster

and the screening of an external electric ﬁeld by the dust Cloud are predicted. In the case of

small Clusters the formation of double layers at the edge of a Cluster is considered. The

dimension of the Cluster plays a role. The competition for charge is crucial in explaining

agglomeration of mesoscopic particles. Larger particles, of the size of a Debye length,

agglomerate mainly because of the ion ‘shadow’ force, a small scale aspect of the self—built

ﬁeld. Experiments with an expansion of dust Clusters in an external plasma sheath seem to

prove the eXistence of the self—built electric ﬁeld at the edge of the Cloud and the screening of

external sheath ﬁelds. Other experiments, such as formation of bubbles, lanes,

electrorheological properties and 2D dislocations in crystals, enlarge the investigations on

collective effects and show their importance in complex plasmas.
