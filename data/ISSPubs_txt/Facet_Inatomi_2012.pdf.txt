Abstract. An in Sim observation experiment of faceted cellular growth was carried out using
transparent organic alloy, salol - t—butyl alcohol, in microgravity conditions on the International
Space Station. The temperature and solute concentration ﬁelds in the vicinity of the solid-liquid and
the growth rate were simultaneously measured by microscopic interferometers.
Introduction

The faceted cellular array growth represented by a sawtooth interface is often observed in
zone-melting recrystallization of thin-ﬁlm silicon single crystals and bulk oxide superconductors.
Since this morphological development of the interface causes segregation of dopants, great interest
in understanding the pattern formation in faceted cellular array growth has been taken over 30 years
[1-5]. Although many theoretical models have been proposed, e.g., two-dimensional nuclei [6, 7],
persistent dislocation [8] and accumulated strain energy [9], there have been few works that
experimental evidences are consistent with theoretical mechanisms. Shangguan et a]. performed in
Sim observations of unidirectional solidiﬁcation of transparent and faeeting organic compounds by a
microscope and by numerical work on the pattern formation [10]. In their studies, it has been
suggested that the mechanism to maintain stable morphology of the interface at the steady-state
growth rate imposed by the heater movement was attributed to solute pile-up in front of the bottom
of the cellular interface, and solute concentration at the bottom increased to keep constant kinetic
undereooling. This was based on the assumption that even in materials characterized by faceted
solidiﬁcation the latent heat of solidiﬁcation was quickly removed through the solid.

Higashino et a]. reported appearance of reealescence regions in front of growing surface in
phenyl salieylate (salol) by means of an in Sim observation using an interferometer [11]. In addition,
they observed that the morphology of the cellular array was kept at constant growth rate, although
puriﬁed salol was used as a specimen. The growth rate and the temperature gradient in the cell were
sarne orders of magnitude as the Shangguan’s works. The main reason of the discrepancy between
the theories and the experimental results is that it is difﬁcult to quantitatively evaluate the interface
kinetics effect, which controls incorporation process of atoms or molecules at the interface.
However, temperature and concentration gradients in the liquid become driving forces of
convection in the liquid and the convection inﬂuences the morphological change of the growth
interface. Therefore, application of a microgravity environment is considered to be a promising
method to investigate the morphological stability of the growth interface. In the present paper
FACET (Investigation on Mechanism of Faceted Cellular Array Growth) project conducted in
microgravity are brieﬂy introduced.

Experimental Procedure
Specimen

Crystallization of salol - t—butyl alcohol alloy and puriﬁed salol, which showed faceted growth
interfaces, was carried out with a constant temperature gradient and with a constant cooling rate at
both ends of the specimen cell. These materials of commercial grade of 98 wt% are distilled or
puriﬁed by several zone-reﬁning cycles on a laboratory scale, because measuring error due to
undesirable impurity in the material should be eliminated for an interferometric analysis described
below. A binary phase diagram of the alloy was shown in Ref. [12].

The specimen cell consisted of a quartz glass container, Peltier devices, thermocouples, and the
specimen material. The specimen was enclosed into the glass container. Two thin thermocouples
were installed in the container to obtain reference temperature in the specimen. The Peltier devices
embedded at the both ends of the specimen cell for heating and cooling were controlled by the pair
of the thermocouples, embedded in the metal blocks. The thickness of the specimen was 1 mm in
order to suppress buoyancy convection driven by the residual gravity acceleration and to measure
temperature and concentration ﬁelds by an in Sim observation setup.

Two specimen cells with the initial concentration of 4 mol% and 8 mol% t-butyl alcohol were
placed in a cell cartridge with 220 mm in diameter and 65 mm in height. The cell cartridge was
available with temperature, pressure and atmosphere controls. The specimens were partially melted
and crystallized in the same specimen cell with different temperature program repeatedly.

T0 preset initial boundary spacing in the crystals, seed crystals with a favorable orientation were
pre-grown in several pores of 500 ttmcp in the bottom plate of the cell at the ﬁrst stage so that cell
boundaries were isolated at regular intervals. In the second stage, periodic remelting and regrowth
during the growth of seed crystals were performed to improve the quality of crystals. At the
beginning of crystallization, the specimen was kept stationary in temperature gradient for several
hours, so that a planar growth interface was formed and the seed crystals grown up to nearly
constant dimensions. Experimental conditions for controlling crystallization of the specimen are
shown in Table 1. The images of the FACET cell cartridge developed for this experiment are shown
in Fig. 1.

Basis of in Sim observation

Refractive index of transparent alloy melt depends on temperature, concentration and
wavelength of incident light. If change of temperature and concentration in the melt, AT and AC,
are small enough, change of the refractive index Am satisﬁes the following linear relation:

Anl. = (6111. /6T)C AT+(6ni /6C)TAC , (1)
where the subscript i: wavelength of light, ni: refractive index of melt; T : temperature; and C:
concentration, respectively. Therefore, spatial distribution images of two different wavelengths are
transformed into temperature and concentration distributions by solving Eq. (1). In the temperature
range from 298 K to 338 K, (8111. / 8T)TC and (6111. / 6C)C 0f salol - t—butyl alcohol were
experimentally obtained for 7» = 458 nm and 780 nm in wavelength [10].

Onboard setup for in situ observation of crystal growth in space

The advantages of 188 over a parabolic ﬂight of a sounding rocket are as follows: 1)
achievement of a longer and higher quality microgravity environment, (2) ability of experimental
operations by 188 crew or remotely from an experiment rack. Experiment parameters can be
changed by sending commands from Earth. Solution Crystallization Observation Facility (SCOF) is
a J apan Aerospace Exploration Agency (JAXA) subrack facility. Schematic illustrations of SCOF
are shown in Fig. 2. SCOF has an amplitude modulation microscope and is equipped a
two-wavelength microscopic interferometer with 7» = 532 nm and 780 11m to simultaneously
measure morphological change of crystals and distributions of temperature and concentration ﬁelds
in specimen cells. SCOF can be controlled remotely from Tsukuba Space Center of J AXA.

The interferometer in SCOF was used in order to Visualize both the refractive index distributions
in the liquid as interference fringes. The morphological change of the growth interface was
Visualized as a bright ﬁeld image by the amplitude modulation microscope.

Results and discussion

FACET experiment on 188 was completed 011 October 17, 2010. The morphology of the growth
interface and the interference fringe pattern corresponding to temperature and concentration
distributions in the liquid were successfully measured by SCOF. Figure 3 shows example images of

the growing faceted cellular array observed by SCOF at the same time. The interference fringe
patterns obtained in 188 were distinctly different from that obtained under the terrestrial condition.
The narrow interspaee 0f the fringe pattern in the vicinity of the growth interface in Fig. 3 indicates
that mass transport was governed by diffusion under the microgravity condition in 188.

The fringe patterns were analyzed by a fringe tracing method and by a spatial carrier method.
The shape of the growth interface was measured by outline extraction of the bright ﬁeld image
obtained by the amplitude modulation microscope. A diffusion coefﬁcient of t—butyl alcohol
molecule in salol melt was calculated as the ﬁrst step of the interferometric analysis. A local
balance in mass ﬂux j of solute molecules at the growth interface must be upheld during the growth.
The total species mass ﬂux at a planar growth interface x = 0 is described as

j = D(8C/8x)x:0 = (k —1)CLV , (2)
where D: the diffusion coefﬁcient; C: concentration gradient of solute molecule; x: the spatial
coordinate perpendicular to the interface; k: the equilibrium distribution coefﬁcient; CL: the
concentration in liquid at x = O; and V: the growth rate, respectively. The equilibrium distribution
coefﬁcient k was obtained from the phase diagram. Since C(X), CL and V were obtained
simultaneously from the measurement results of the concentration ﬁeld and the growth velocity, the
diffusion coefﬁcient D was calculated as 1.3X10'9 m2/s using Eq. (2) at the initial stage of the
growth before formation of the facetted cellular array structure shown in Fig. 3.

Summary

The in situ observation experiment for faceted cellular array growth in microgravity 0n the 188
was brieﬂy introduced. In the experiment temperature and concentration ﬁelds in the vicinity of the
growth interface were simultaneously measured in real time. The diffusion coefﬁcient of t—butyl
alcohol molecule in salol melt was obtained as the ﬁrst step of the interferometric analysis.
