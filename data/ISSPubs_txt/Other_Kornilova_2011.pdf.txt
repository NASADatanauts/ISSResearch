Abstract—To determine the role of the support—proprioceptive factor in functioning of the vestibular system,

in particular, the role of static torsional otolith—cervical—ocular reﬂex (OCOR), the latter was studied in

16 subjects after a seven—day “dry” horizontal immersion and in 14 cosmonauts after a prolonged exposure

to weightlessness (for 126—195 days). OCOR was studied by the Videooculography method during alternately

tilting the head towards the right or left shoulder by an angle of 300 in the frontal plane before the ﬂight and

before immersion, as well as on days 1, 3, and 7 after the completion of the immersion experiment and on

days 1 (2), 4 (5), and 8 (9) after the spaceﬂight. For the ﬁrst time it was demonstrated that elimination of the

support and minimizing the proprioceptive afferentation may lead to the absence or inversion of the static

torsional OCOR, as well as to a positional nystagrnus against the background of the inverted reﬂex. Compar—

ison of OCOR in cosmonauts after prolonged exposure to weightlessness and in the subjects examined after

immersion revealed similarity in this reaction. However, changes in OCOR after immersion were encoun—

tered only in 60% of the subjects, whereas after the spaceﬂight, in 90% of the cosmonauts examined. The

post—ﬂight changes in OCOR were more pronounced and long—lasting.

Keywords: the static torsional otolith—cervical—ocular reﬂex, weightlessness, immersion.
