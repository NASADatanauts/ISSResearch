g In general the system worked very well. However, the
team struggled with unforeseen noise effects in the
spectra, which will be closely investigated in the follow-
on programme. The produced additional noise in the
measurement spectra, which is by an order of
magnitude larger than the noise in spectra taken on
ground, is shown in the following ﬁgures. In Figure 7 a
ground-based spectrum is compared with a typical
spectrum measured on the ISS. This additional noise
was never observed on ground and appeared for the
very first time in measurements on-board.
