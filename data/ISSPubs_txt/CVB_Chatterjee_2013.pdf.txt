E A constrained vapor bubble heat pipe experiment was run in the microgravity environment of the International
Q Space Station. Here we present the initial results that demonstrate signiﬁcant differences in the operation of the
S constrained vapor bubble heat pipe in the microgravity environment as compared to the Earth’s gravity. The
a temperature proﬁle data along the heat pipe indicate that the heat pipe behavior is affected favorably by increased
25 capillary ﬂow and adversely by the absence of outside convective heat transfer as a heat loss mechanism. The
5 reﬂectivity pattern Viewed through the transparent quartz wall documented complex microﬂow patterns. Image data
g) of the liquid proﬁle in the grooves of the heat pipe indicate that the curvature gradient giving capillary ﬂow is
‘5 considerably different from that on Earth. Using experimental data for the temperature and meniscus proﬁles, a one-
.§ dimensional model gives the inside heat transfer coefﬁcient, which was signiﬁcantly higher in microgravity. An initial
g discussion of some of the data collected is presented.
