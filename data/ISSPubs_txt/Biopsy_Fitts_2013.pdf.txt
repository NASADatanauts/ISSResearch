"2","23 Abstract 2
24 Our primary goal was to determine the effects of siX-month ﬂight 011 the International Space Station

25 (188) 011 selected anaerobic and aerobic enzymes, and the content of glycogen and lipids in slow and fast ﬁbers
26 0f the soleus and gastroenemius. Following local anesthesia, biopsies were obtained from nine ISS crew

27 members ~45 days pre- and 011 landing day (R+0) post-ﬂight. We subdivided the crew into those that ran 200
28 min week""1 or more (high treadmill, HT) in-ﬂight from those who ran less than 100 min week""1 (10w treadmill,
29 LT). In the LT group, there was a loss of lipid in soleus type I ﬁbers, and muscle glycogen signiﬁcantly

30 increased in soleus ﬁber types post-ﬂight. Soleus cytochrome oxidase (CO) activity was signiﬁcantly depressed
31 post-ﬂight in the type 1 ﬁber. This was attributed to the LT group where CO activity was reduced 59%.

32 Otherwise, there was no change in the crew mean for type I or IIa ﬁber glycolytie 0r mitochondrial enzyme

33 activities pre- vs. post-ﬂight in either muscle. However, two of the three HT (subj eets E & H) showed

34 significant increases in both B-hydroxyaeyl-COA dehydrogenase and citrate synthase in the soleus type I ﬁbers,
35 and subj ect E exhibiting the largest increase in soleus oxidative enzymes was the only subj ect to show a

36 significant decrease in glycolytie enzyme activity. It’s apparent that crew members performing adequate

37 treadmill running can maintain calf muscle enzymes, which suggests that increased fatigue with weightlessness
38 cannot be directly caused by a decline in muscle enzyme capacity.

"3","40 Introduction 3
41 One of the maj or problems facing manned exploration of Earth’s Moon, Mars, and destinations further
42 out in the solar system is curbing muscle wasting and the associated decline in performance, and increased

43 fatigue that occurs with prolonged missions in microgravity. Since the Skylab ﬂights in the 1970’s, and the MIR
44 space station ﬂights in the 1980’s, it has been known that the microgravity environment leads to considerable
45 muscle wasting and functional decline in limb muscles, with some of the most effected muscles being the soleus
46 and gastroenemius of the calf (11). Our recent studies of crew members following S1X months on the

47 International Space Station (188) showed that prolonged weightlessness produced substantial loss of ﬁber mass,
48 force, and power with the hierarchy of the effects being soleus type I > soleus type II > gastroenemius type I >
49 gastroenemius type II (11). The quantitatively most important adaptation was ﬁber atrophy which averaged

50 20% in soleus type I ﬁbers, but reached as high as 46% in one crew member. The loss of lower leg muscle

51 circumference and performance observed during Skylab, MIR and the more recent 188 ﬂights occurred despite
52 considerable countermeasure exercise (26).

53 The observation that three male orewmembers aboard the 84-day Skylab 4 mission were able not only to
54 maintain but actually increase V02 peak, suggested that cardiovascular capacity could be maintained during

55 prolonged microgravity missions (23, 25). However, during the 17-day STS-78 Shuttle mission, we observed a
56 progressive decline of -6%, -9%, and -11% in the V02 obtained while exercising at a heart rate (HR) equal to
57 85% of the pre-ﬂight max HR on spaceﬂight days 2, 8, and 13, respectively (27). Furthermore, while LeVine et
58 al. (18) reported no change in V02 peak during 9- and 14-day space shuttle missions aboard SLS-l and SLS-2,

59 they reported a post-ﬂight average decline of 22%. Collectively, these data suggest that the earlier Skylab data
60 may have been inﬂuenced by a training response due to the large amount of countermeasure exercise in-ﬂight
61 that far exceeded the crews pre-ﬂight exercise regimen (23, 25). The miorogravity-induoed decline in V02 peak
62 appears to be, at least in part, caused by a decrease in plasma volume that reduces stroke volume and cardiac

63 output (27). Regardless of the cause, the reduced V02 peak in microgravity would increase the relative workload

"
"4","64 of any task, and could in part explain the observation that astronauts performing heavy work such as 4
65 extravehioular activity experience increased fatigability (18).

66 Work capacity and resistance to fatigue is dependent not only on aerobic capacity, but is also inﬂuenced
67 by metabolic changes within the muscle. Miorogravity causes a ﬁber type shift from slow type I to fast

68 phenotypes with the magnitude of the shift greater in prolonged vs. short duration ﬂights and correlated with the
69 extent of fiber atrophy (8, 11, 28). For a given workload, the relative work for the atrophied fibers would be

70 higher which in turn would stimulate glycolysis and presumably trigger the induction of glycolytio enzymes.

71 Data from rats ﬂown in space provide evidence for a miorogravity-induoed increase in glycolytio enzymes.

72 Manchester et al. (20) and Chi et al. (3) found selected glycolytio enzymes in the rat soleus to increase 28 to 56
73 % following 12.5-d spaceﬂight, while Musaoohia et al. (24) reported lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) activity of
74 the rat vastus medialis to increase 52% following a 14-d ﬂight. Regarding muscle oxidative capacity, the data
75 from rats show that the loss of mitochondrial protein with short duration spaceﬂight is less than that observed
76 for the contractile protein and for the degree of cell atrophy. Thus, mitochondrial oxidative enzyme activity (per
77 g tissue dry wt.) either remains unaltered or slightly elevated (10). Consistent with this, Edgerton et al. (8)

78 found no signiﬁcant effects of an 11-day spaceﬂight on the suooinate dehydrogenase (SDH) activity of the

79 vastus lateralis in humans. Despite the maintenance of muscle oxidative enzyme activity and the ability to

80 oxidize pyruvate, Baldwin et al. (1) observed a 37% decline in the capacity to oxidize long-ohain fatty acids in
81 the high- and low-oxidative regions of the rat vastus muscle following a 9-day spaceﬂight. An increased

82 reliance on glycolysis coupled with a reduced ability to oxidize fats would accelerate muscle glycogen use, and
83 increase metabolic products such as the H+ and inorganic phosphate (Pi) ions known to contribute to fatigue (6,
84 7,16)

85 To date, there are no data on how prolonged spaceﬂight alters the metabolic or substrate profile in

86 human skeletal muscle. The purpose of this work was to determine the effects of siX-month spaceﬂight on the
87 International Space Station (188) on selected anaerobic and aerobic enzymes, and the content of glycogen and

"
"5","88 lipids in slow and fast ﬁbers of the soleus and gastroenemius. The effects of countermeasure exercise were 5

89 evaluated by relating pre- and post-ﬂight enzyme patterns to the extent of in-ﬂight treadmill exercise.

91 Methods

92 F light and subjects

93 The overall study design and subj ect characteristics were reported previously (11, 26) and brieﬂy

94 reviewed here. The erewmembers participating in this study ﬂew aboard the 188 from increments 5 to 11 (2002-

95 2005). In the overall study group there were ten crewmembers, ﬁve American astronauts and ﬁve Russian

96 cosmonauts, but for the metabolic studies describe here there were nine subj eets (ﬁve astronauts and four

97 cosmonauts). Due to small sample size and/or problems in shipment from Russia to the US, the histochemieal

98 and biochemical assays were performed on biopsy tissue from six or seven and eight crew members,

99 respectively. Prior to volunteering to participate in this study, all crew members were informed of the risks and
100 beneﬁts of the research and gave their written consent in accordance with the Human Subj eets Institutional
101 Review Boards at Marquette University, Ball State University, The Medical College of Wisconsin, and the
102 National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA; J ohnson Space Center). This study was conducted in
103 accordance with the Declaration ofHelsinki.
104 Exercise countermeasure
105 The pre- and in-ﬂight exercise programs of each crew member have been published elsewhere (26), and
106 due to their importance to this work are summarized in Table 1. The exercise proﬁles were determined from
107 crew member logbooks and from downloaded analog data from the treadmill and cycle ergometer. The exercise
108 countermeasures including the resistance exercise were classified as moderate intensity aerobic activities. In our
109 previous publication (11), we found that the degree of treadmill running inﬂuenced the extent of ﬁber atrophy.
110 Less atrophy occurred as total treadmill running in min/wk increased (r = 0.68). Thus, we subdivided the crew
111 into those running 200 min week""1 or more (high treadmill, HT) from those running less than 100 min week""1
112 (10w treadmill, LT). The weekly treadmill running average for each crew member has been published (26).

"
"6","113 Muscle biopsies 6
114 A muscle biopsy of ~80 mg was obtained from the mid-belly 0f the lateral head of the gastrocnemius
115 and the soleus muscles of each crew member prior to launch (L-5 5 i 2) and 011 landing day (R + 0) as described
116 previously (11, 26). The biopsy sample was divided longitudinally into three portions for structural,

117 biochemical and functional studies, with the latter reported on previously (11). Two of the portions were

118 longitudinally aligned on small index cards and frozen in liquid nitrogen. These samples were shipped in a

119 liquid nitrogen dry shipper t0 Marquette University. One portion was used for histochemical and

120 immunostaining studies of enzymes and substrates, and the other was freeze-dried under vacuum at -35°C and
121 stored under vacuum at -80°C for single fiber biochemical analyses of selected metabolic enzymes (9).

122 Histological assays

123 T issue sectioning and staining. Serial cross sections (8-10 pm) of muscle were cut with a cryostat

124 mierotome and picked up on glass slides. Histochemieal ﬁber typing was performed by reacting for actomyosin
125 ATPase activity (acid and alkaline preincubation) and immunostaining for myosin heavy chain specific

126 antibodies for type 1, 11a, and IIX myosin (12). Immunospeeiﬁe protein staining was also performed for citrate
127 synthase, carnitine palmitoyltransferase, phosphofructokinase, glucose transporter type 4 and uncoupling

128 protein 3. N0 marked differences in these proteins were observed subj ectively for preﬂight and postﬂight

129 muscles s0 antibody staining quantitation was not conducted. Mitochondrial oxidative activity was

130 demonstrated by reacting for cytochrome oxidase activity (30). Oil red O staining was used to assess

131 intracellular lipid content (17). Glycogen content was Visualized by periodic acid Sehiff (PAS) staining (22).
132 Sections of the preﬂight and postﬂight muscles were collected on the same slide so that the conditions of

133 staining were identical.

134 F iber T ype percentage, size determination, and assessment Ofstaining. In acid-preincubated ATPase
135 sections, the percentages of darkly-stained slow, lightly-stained fast, and intermediately-reactive hybrid ﬁbers
136 were counted, and fiber type sizes were measured using computerized morphometry (Metamorph 4.6).

137 Cytochrome oxidase reaction product content was measured per muscle ﬁber using the thresholding detection

"
"7","138 algorithm in Metamorph and normalized to fiber cross section area as area % staining. Lipid content per fiber 7
139 was quantified by thresholding detection of oil red O stained droplets and normalizing to ﬁber area. The PAS
140 reaction for glycogen produced a pink coloration of the ﬁber. The glycogen content was deﬁned as the optical
141 density of the staining product within single muscle ﬁbers using Metamorph morphometry and densitometry
142 algorithms.

143 Single ﬁber biochemical analysis ofaerobic and anaerobic enzymes

144 F iber preparation. The freeze-dried samples were warmed to room temperature while under vacuum,
145 and then ﬁbers (~2 mm long) were dissected free in a temperature and humidity controlled room (22°C, < 30%
146 humidity). The isolated ﬁbers were restored individually under vacuum at -80°C. At the time of assay, the ﬁbers
147 were returned to room ambient conditions and divided into three equal segments. Two segments were used for
148 the enzyme assays described below, and the third was run on sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel

149 electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) for ﬁber-type determination by myosin heavy content as described previously (11,
150 29). Each segment was weighed 011 a quartz ﬁber balance (19).The assays were conducted as described by

151 Lowry and Passonneau (19), using methods based on pyridine nucleotide enzyme reactions. In all cases, the
152 sample mass was large enough to allow direct measurement of the formed pyridine nucleotide. The enzyme

153 activities were expressed as moles per kilogram dry weight per hour. The assays described below were carried
154 out in 1.51111 centrifuge tubes.

155 Citrate synthase. Individual freeze-dried fiber segments (300-400 mg) from the soleus and gastrocnemius
156 were dissolved (10ng/ttl) in a solution contained 20 111M phosphate buffer (pH 7.4), 0.6 M KCl, 0.05 % bovine
157 serum albumin (BSA), 0.5 mM EDTA, 5 mM B-mereaptoethanol (BME) and 0.5% Triton X-100 and

158 preincubated at 25°C for 2 hrs. After preincubation, 2 pl were transferred to 25 pl of specific reagent and

159 incubated for 60 min at 25 CC. The specific reagent contained 50 mM Tris-HCl buffer (pH 8.1), 0.25% BSA,
160 0.5 111M oxaloacetate and 0.5 111M acetyl Coenzyme A. The reaction was stopped by adding 10 pl of 0.2 M

161 NaOH and heating at 95 CC for 5 min. After cooling to 25 CC, 250 pl of the citrate reagent was added, and the
162 mixture incubated in the dark at 250C. The citrate reagent contained 50 mM Tris-HCI (10:40), 0.1 mM ZnClz,

"
"8","163 0.02% BSA, 0.1 mM NADH, 2.5 U/mL malic dehydrogenase and 0.024 U/mL citrate lyase. After 25 min, the 8
164 excess NADH was destroyed by adding 30u1 of 1 M HCl and incubating for 20 min at 250C. A 100 pl aliquot
165 of the reaction assay was added to 1 m1 of 6 N NaOH plus 10 mM imidazole and heated in the dark for 20 min
166 at 600C to destroy the NAD and to produce a ﬂuorescent product. The reaction was cooled to 250C, and the
167 ﬂuorescence intensity was measured.

168 ,B-Hydroxyacyl-COA dehydrogenase. Following preincubation (as described for citrate synthase),
169 2 ul were transferred to 100 pl of speciﬁc reagent and incubated in the dark for 60 min at 25 CC. The speciﬁc
170 reagent contained 150 mM imidazole buffer (pH 7.0), 0.6 M HCl, 1 mM EDTA, 0.05% BSA, 125 uM NADH
171 and 1 mM acetoacetyl CoA. The reaction was stopped by adding 10 ul of 0.5 N HCl and holding at 250C for 10
172 min. The NAD produced was converted to a ﬂuorescence product as described for the citrate synthase assay,
173 and the ﬂuorescence measured.

174 Lactic Dehydrogenase. The ﬁber preincubation, reaction sequence (including aliquot volumes
175 and incubation times), and production and measurement of the ﬂuorescence product were the same as described
176 for B-hydroxyacyl-CoA dehydrogenase assay except the reaction was stopped with 10 ul of 1 N HCl . The

177 speciﬁc reagent contained 100 mM imidazole buffer (pH 7.0), 40 mM sodium pyruvate, 0.05% BSA and 125
178 uM NADH.

179 Phosphofructokinase. The ﬁber segment was added directly to 100 pl of speciﬁc reagent and 10 ul of
180 H20, and the assay was conducted as described above for lactic dehydrogenase. The specific reagent was

181 comprised of 50 mM Tris-HCl (pH 8.1), 10 mM K2HP04, 1 mM 5’AMP, 1 mM ATP, 1.5 mM fructose-6-

182 phosphate, 0.05% BSA, 1 mM MgC12, 2 mM NADH, 0.2 U/ml aldolase, 20 U/ml triose phosphate isomerase
183 and 3 U/ml oc-glycerol PDH.

184 Statistical analyses

185 For the histochemical analyses and the biochemical determinations of aerobic and anaerobic enzyme
186 activities in single slow type I and fast type II ﬁbers, statistical differences between the pre- and post-ﬂight

"
"9","187 values for each crew member and for the group means (10w versus high treadmill groups) were assessed using 9
188 the Student’s unpaired two-tailed t test with a 0.05 level of confidence.

191 Results

192 The effect of prolonged microgravity on slow type I and fast type 11 ﬁber size was reported in detail

193 previously (11). Here our purpose was to relate the atrophy of a given ﬁber type to speciﬁc enzyme and

194 substrate changes. As reported previously (11), the degree of ﬁber atrophy varied greatly between crew

195 members, and considerable variability was also found in muscle enzymes. The LT crew members, running less
196 than 100 min week'l, showed more ﬁber atrophy than the HT group, running 200 min week""1 or more (11). For
197 the soleus muscle, the average decline in diameter for the type I and II ﬁbers was 20 and 16 %, respectively, but
198 the differences between the LT and HT groups was substantial for the soleus type I (29% LT vs. 8% HT), and
199 type II (27% LT vs. 3% HT) ﬁbers (11). Subj eets were identiﬁed with the letters A — I using the same letter

200 scheme as in our previous publications (11, 26). Subjects B, E, G, H are in the HT group, and A, C, D, F, I are
201 LT members.

202 Soleus muscle histochemistry: enzyme activity and substrate content.

203 Figures 1 and 2 show eross-seetions of pre- and post-ﬂight soleus muscle ﬁbers reacted for aetomyosin ATPase
204 activity to illustrate ﬁber types in a low treadmill subj ect C (Fig. 1A,B) and a high treadmill subj eet E (Fig. 2
205 AB). 111 the aeid-preincubated ATPase sections, type I slow-twitch oxidative ﬁbers are darkly stained. Type IIa
206 fast-twiteh oxidative glycolytie ﬁbers are lightly reactive. Based on immunostaining for fast and slow myosins
207 (data not shown), the moderately reactive ﬁbers are hybrid ﬁbers containing both fast and slow myosin (Fig.
208 2A). Histologically, there were insufﬁcient numbers of 11X ﬁbers in the soleus and gastrocnemius muscle

209 sections to quantify cytochrome oxidase (CO), lipid or glycogen content in this ﬁber type so the measurements
210 in Tables 2-4 were restricted to type I and 11a ﬁbers. Post-ﬂight atrophy is evident in the ﬁbers of LT subj eet C
211 (Fig 1B), whereas atrophy did not occur in the HT subj ect E (Fig. 2B).

"
"10","212 In the pre-ﬂight samples of all subj ects, the mean CO activity for soleus type Ila ﬁbers was 10
213 signiﬁcantly less than for the slow type I ﬁbers. Post-ﬂight, the all crew member mean for CO activity for the
214 fast type Ila ﬁber was unchanged, while the activity of this enzyme was signiﬁcantly depressed in the slow type
215 1 ﬁber (Table 2). Despite no change in the composite mean (HT and LT groups combined), the soleus type Ila
216 ﬁbers of the HT group had post-ﬂight values significantly higher than pre-ﬂight, while the LT group mean was
217 unaltered (Table 2). The CO activities for subjects C and E are shown in serial section (Fig. 1C, D and Fig. 2C,
218 D, respectively). The CO reaction product indicates an abundance of mitochondria in subsarcolemmal clusters
219 and within myoﬁbrils. The area % of CO reaction product per muscle ﬁber area was reduced by 64% in the

220 post-ﬂight soleus of subject C (Fig. 1C, D; Table 2). The average reduction was 59% for the 4 low treadmill
221 subj ects (Table 2). For subj ect E, the CO activity was not signiﬁcantly altered post-ﬂight (Fig. 2 C, D; Table 2).
222 The three high treadmill subj ects on average showed no signiﬁcant change in CO activity, but large individual
223 variation was present in the soleus type 1 ﬁber with subj ect B highly increased, E unchanged, and H

224 signiﬁcantly down (Table 2).

225 Soleus ﬁber lipid content was quantiﬁed in oil red O stained sections (Fig. 1E, F and 2E, F). The lipid
226 stained ﬁbers are serial to the acid ATPase sections. The lipid content pre-ﬂight was higher in type I ﬁbers than
227 Ila ﬁbers (Table 3). Post-ﬂight in the LT group, there was loss of lipid in type I ﬁbers, while the lipid content
228 was preserved in the HT group (Table 3). Pooling All crew members, the soleus type 1 ﬁber lipid was

229 unchanged post-ﬂight (Table 3). Representative of the LT group, subj ect C’s soleus type I ﬁbers exhibited

230 decreased lipid post-ﬂight (Fig. 1E, F). In contrast, the HT subj ect E had higher type 1 ﬁber lipid pre-ﬂight than
231 subject C, and the lipid content was maintained post-ﬂight (Fig. 2E, 2E; Table 3).

232 Gastrocnemius muscle histology. Atrophy was pronounced in the gastrocnemius type I and II ﬁbers in
233 the LT group. Figure 3 illustrates ﬁber atrophy in alkaline-preincubation actomyosin reacted sections from

234 subj eet D (Fig. 3A, B). This individual exhibits a shift from mostly type I ﬁbers (lightly-stained) to expression
235 of darkly-stained type II ﬁbers postﬂight (Fig. 3B). Immunostaining with myosin isoform speciﬁc antibodies for
236 type Ila and IIX revealed that a small proportion of type II ﬁbers contained IIX myosin (data not shown). Serial

"
"11","237 sections revealed that CO decreased post-ﬂight in large part due to loss of peripheral subsareolemmal 11
238 staining (Fig. 3C, D). CO levels were significantly lower in gastroenemius type I ﬁbers of the LT group

239 postﬂight (Table 2). For the LT and HT groups, lipid concentration in gastroenemius type I and Ila ﬁbers tended
240 higher post-ﬂight but not signiﬁcantly (Table 4). However, a signiﬁcant increase in lipid content was observed
241 post-ﬂight for subj eet D and E for the type 1 ﬁber, and subj eet H for the type Ila ﬁber (Fig 3E, F, Table 4).

242 F iber glycogen. Fiber glycogen was assessed histologically with periodic acid Schiff (PAS) staining.
243 Post-ﬂight soleus glycogen was signiﬁcantly elevated for slow type I and fast type Ila fibers when all crew were
244 compared quantitatively for PAS staining by optical density (Table 3). Representative mierographs illustrate LT
245 subj eet C soleus in which glycogen signiﬁcantly increased post-ﬂight in both type I and Ila ﬁbers (Fig. 4A, B).
246 For the gastrocnemius muscle, the pre-ﬂight levels of glycogen in type I and Ila ﬁbers are higher than that in the
247 soleus (Tables 3 and 4), and all crew quantitation reveals maintenance of PAS staining in the post-ﬂight ﬁbers
248 (Table 4). When the individual changes are examined, there are signiﬁcant increases as shown in Figure 4C, D
249 for subj eet A, and decreases in gastroenemius glycogen staining that are not explained by high or low treadmill
250 exercise (Table 4).

251 Biochemical Analysis ofEnzyme Capacity

252 Soleus muscle. The effect of prolonged spaceﬂight 0n the glycolytie enzymes lactic dehydrogenase

253 (LDH) and phosphofruetokinase (PFK), and the mitochondrial enzymes B-hydroxyaeyl-COA dehydrogenase
254 (BOAC) and citrate synthase (CS) in soleus type I and type II ﬁbers are shown in Tables 5 and 6, respectively.
255 When all crew members were grouped together, there was no change in the soleus type 1 ﬁber glycolytie or

256 mitochondrial enzyme activity (Table 5). However, two of the three HT (subjects E & H) showed significant
257 increases in both BOAC and CS in the soleus type I ﬁbers (Table 5). One LT, subject I, also showed an

258 increased mitochondrial enzyme capacity, but the magnitude of the increase (11 and 25 %) was considerably
259 less than that for the HT subjects where the increase ranged from 40-87 %. Regarding the soleus type 1 ﬁber,
260 Subj eet E (HT group) exhibited the largest increase in oxidative enzymes and was the only subj eet to show a

"
"12","261 signiﬁcant decrease in glycolytic enzyme activity. In contrast, subj eet C (LT group) showed a large decline in 12
262 cytochrome oxidase, and signiﬁcant increase in the glycolytie enzyme LDH (Table 5). Figure 5 shows a plot of
263 CS vs. LDH for subj eet C and E for these ﬁbers in which the activity of these two enzymes were determined.
264 The plot demonstrates the rather wide range of enzyme activities that eXist within a given ﬁber type, and the
265 post-ﬂight shift to higher aerobic (CS) and lower glycolytie (LDH) enzyme activities in the HT subj eet E, and
266 the elevated LDH in the LT subject C (Fig. 5).

267 Glycolytie and mitochondrial enzyme activities of the fast type II ﬁbers in the soleus were with few

268 exceptions unaltered by the 6 m0 of microgravity. The exception was LDH where subj eets C and H showed a
269 significant decrease, and subj ect D a signiﬁcant increase post-ﬂight (Table 6).

270 Gastrocnemius muscle. The glycolytic and mitochondrial enzyme activities of the gastroenemius slow
271 type I and fast type II ﬁbers, and their changes with prolonged space ﬂight are shown in Tables 7 and 8. From a
272 qualitative perspective, the microgravity effects in the slow type 1 ﬁber were similar to those observed for this
273 ﬁber type in the soleus in that no changes were observed in group means for any enzyme. Examination of the
274 individuals revealed that subj eets who showed a signiﬁcant increase in CS activity (A, E, and G) showed a

275 signiﬁcant decrease in LDH activity, and subj eet I with a post-ﬂight decline in CS showed an increased LDH
276 (Table 7). Figure 6 illustrates this point by showing a plot for BOAC vs. LDH for gastroenemius type I ﬁbers
277 for subj eets D and G pre- and post-ﬂight. Similar to the soleus, within a ﬁber type there is a wide range of

278 activities for a given enzyme, and subj ect G with a signiﬁcant post-ﬂight increase in BOAC showed a

279 signiﬁcant decline in LDH activity. In comparison, subj eet D showed a signiﬁcant increase in LDH which was
280 accompanied by a small but non-signiﬁeant decline in BOAC.

281 The gastroenemius type 11 ﬁber showed no group mean changes with microgravity for any of the

282 enzymes studied (Table 8). However, similar to the type 1 ﬁber, when a signiﬁcant increase in oxidative enzyme
283 was observed as for subj ect H, a signiﬁcant decline was observed for LDH (Table 8). Comparing the LT and
284 HT groups means one sees that there were no significant differences pre- versus post-ﬂight, but the BOAC

"
"13","285 tended up and the LDH down in the HT group with the opposite observed for the LT group (Table 8). The 13
286 reciprocal change for the HT group with the glycolytie enzyme decreasing and the oxidative enzymes

287 increasing post-ﬂight is shown in Figure 7 for subj eet H. The ﬁgure also shows the post-ﬂight increase in LDH
288 for LT subj eet A.

289 Discussion

290 The results presented in this study are the ﬁrst to evaluate the effects of prolonged space travel

291 (weightlessness plus exercise countermeasures) 0n the activity of metabolic enzymes and muscle substrates. We
292 have shown previously, that despite in-ﬂight aerobic and strength exercise-training, prolonged weightlessness
293 caused considerable declines in ﬁber mass, force and power with the greatest effects observed in the slow type I
294 ﬁbers of the soleus (11, 26). We observed that these changes were partially attenuated by treadmill running, as a
295 result here and in our previous publications (11, 26), the crew members were subdivided into those running 200
296 min week""1 or more (high treadmill, HT) from those running less than 100 min week""1 (10w treadmill, LT).

297 A consistent observation is that crew members during weightlessness experience increased fatigue, and
298 this is particularly true during extravehicular activities (5, 18). This is in part explained by declines in peak

299 aerobic capacity and muscle atrophy so that loads represent a higher % 0f the crew member’s peak aerobic

300 capacity (11, 26). The extent to which the latter could be attributed to declines in stroke volume and thus

301 cardiac output versus a reduced tissue oxidative capacity is unknown. With short duration space ﬂight, we

302 observed V02 elicited at a HR equal to 85% 0f the crew members pre-ﬂight maximum HR to show a rapid and
303 continued decline between day 2 (-6.2%) and day 13 (-11.3%), and recover rapidly post-ﬂight (27). Others have
304 shown short duration space ﬂight to reduce mitochondrial protein, but the decline is less than ﬁber atrophy so
305 the oxidative enzyme activity remained unaltered or slightly elevated when activity was expressed per gram of
306 dry weight (8, 10, 20).

307 Muscle lipids and glycogen. We previously published that the LT crew members showed at the electron
308 microscopic level a high degree of slow ﬁber atrophy in the soleus muscle, and fewer intracellular lipids (11).

"
"14","309 Our current results conﬁrmed this observation as based on oil red O staining, soleus type 1 ﬁber lipid was 14
310 signiﬁcantly reduced in the LT but not the HT crew members. This observation is opposite to that seen with
311 short duration space ﬂight where ﬁber lipid was increased in humans and rats (24, 28). It is not clear why

312 intracellular lipid depletion is associated with ﬁber atrophy, but one possibility includes an increased reliance on
313 the oxidation of intramuscular lipids as an energy source. Alternatively, the intracellular fat depletion in the LT
314 group could have been mediated by a reduced free fatty acid (FFA) mobilization and delivery to the muscle. In
315 support of this hypothesis, we previously observed 15 days of rat hindlimb suspension (a model of

316 weightlessness) to attenuate the redistribution of Visceral blood ﬂow normally observed during exercise (21).
317 While blood ﬂow distribution during exercise in space has not been studied, the chronic stress and elevated

318 blood catecholamine levels associated with prolonged space ﬂight might decrease the cellular response to

319 sympathetic drive (21, 31). This in turn could inhibit the mobilization of free fatty acids, and reduce the

320 redistribution of blood ﬂow from the Viscera t0 the working skeletal muscles thus decreasing FFA delivery,

321 uptake, and use by the muscle. In this study, we found no depression of BOAC a marker enzyme of the [3-

322 oxidation pathway. In fact, this enzyme showed a post-ﬂight increase in the soleus type I ﬁbers in three of the
323 crew members. Following a 9-day space ﬂight, Baldwin et. al. (1) made a similar observation that enzymes of
324 the B-oxidative pathway were unaltered in rat hindlimb muscle. However, they observed a signiﬁcantly reduced
325 ability of the rat vastus muscle to oxidize long-ehain fatty acids, and hypothesized that the inhibition of fat

326 oxidation may have resulted from a reduced ability to activate or translocate fats into the mitochondria. The
327 extent to which fat oxidation may be limited by FFA delivery and/or translocation of fats into the mitochondria
328 in humans awaits in—ﬂight exercise and muscle biopsy studies.

329 As expected the pre-ﬂight glycogen content was higher in the fast type IIa than the slow type I ﬁbers,
330 and this was true in the soleus and gastroenemius. The highest content was observed in the fast ﬁbers of the

331 gastroenemius. Post-ﬂight, the glycogen content was significantly increased in the fast and slow ﬁbers of the
332 soleus but no change was observed in the gastrocnemius. It is not possible to determine if the increase was

333 caused by weightlessness or the fact that the crew consumed carbohydrate- rich foods 12 hrs before return to

"
"15","334 earth. The observation that the glycogen increase was restricted to the soleus could be explained by a 15
335 superoompensation mechanism (13). If the glycogen content of the soleus was chronically low during

336 weightlessness, the carbohydrate loading before return to earth may have stimulated glycogen synthase causing
337 glycogen superoompensation (2, 14).

338 Muscle enzymes. Consistent with previous observations for humans, the subj eots in this study showed a
339 rather wide range of activities for a given enzyme within a particular ﬁber type and muscle (4, 10, 15). For

340 example, the soleus type 1 ﬁber citrate synthase activity for subj eot C pre-ﬂight averaged 6.31 i 0.36 (Table 5),
341 but the range of activity was 3.03 to 8.75 molekg'lhr'1 (Figure 5). A second observation was that the difference
342 in oxidative potential was only slightly higher in type I compared to type II ﬁbers. This was true for both the
343 Krebs cycle enzyme citrate synthase and the B-oxidation pathway enzyme BOAC. In part, this resulted from the
344 fact that most of the fast ﬁbers in both muscles assayed were type Ila. Pre-ﬂight, none of the crew members

345 contained any fast type IIX ﬁbers in their soleus muscles, and post-ﬂight this population averaged only 1% (26).
346 In the gastroenemius, the pure type IIX population averaged 3% in both pre- and post-ﬂight samples (26). In
347 contrast to aerobic enzymes, reasonably large differences were observed in the glycolytio marker enzymes

348 between fast and slow ﬁbers with the fast ﬁbers showing considerably higher activity (Tables 5 -8).

349 Based on the larger ﬁber size and higher aerobic enzyme activities pre-ﬂight, the LT group entered the
350 ﬂight in better condition, but their in-ﬂight training program was less effective compared to the HT group.

351 Consequently, post-ﬂight the soleus type 1 ﬁber aerobic enzymes activities (both citrate synthase and BOAC)
352 were higher in the HT compared to the LT group. As reported previously, the high-volume, moderate-intensity
353 resistance exercise program was insufficient to prevent ﬁber atrophy (11). However, treadmill running did

354 appear to partially protect against ﬁber atrophy, and in subj eots who ran 200 min per week or more (HT group)
355 help to increase muscle aerobic enzyme activity. This observation is important as it demonstrates that in-ﬂight
356 programs of exercise-training of the appropriate nature (i.e. mode, duration, intensity) can not only prevent loss,
357 but stimulate signiﬁcant increases in muscle aerobic enzyme activity, It does not appear that the increased

358 fatigue during and following weightlessness experienced by astronauts and cosmonauts can be directly

"
"16","359 attributed to a loss of muscle aerobic enzyme capacity. In this study, even the LT group maintained unaltered 16
360 or slightly elevated aerobic muscle enzyme activity. However, since muscle mass was signiﬁcantly reduced

361 (~15% for the soleus) following the 6 mo of weightlessness, there would be less enzyme (i.e. mitochondria) and
362 contractile protein in absolute terms. Thus, when extrapolating to whole body activities, such as EVA or

363 exercise, there would be a greater relative demand for the same workload due to less muscle mass. This would
364 be both a metabolic and ﬁber performance (i.e. power) issue, which combined emphasizes the importance of
365 maintaining the metabolic health of the crew by preventing the loss of muscle mass during prolonged periods in
366 microgravity.

367 In conclusion, the results of this study demonstrate that despite prolonged weightlessness crew members
368 are able to maintain their muscle aerobic and glycolytio enzyme capacity and that with adequate amounts of
369 treadmill running even able to improve muscle oxidative capacity. The decline in type 1 ﬁber intracellular lipid
370 in the antigraVity soleus muscle was correlated with ﬁber atrophy, and prevented by treadmill running that

371 exceeded 200 min per week. The increased fatigability reported to occur with weightlessness cannot be directly
372 attributed to a loss of muscle substrate or enzyme capacity, but likely is in part due to ﬁber atrophy such that
373 extravehioular activities require greater ﬁber recruitment, both an increased number of ﬁbers and activation

374 frequency, both of which lead to an earlier onset of fatigue.
