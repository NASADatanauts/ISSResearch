Storage different plasmids allowing monitoring of proliferation and the Nuclear Factor KB (NF—KB) pathway by
NUCIEar faCtor KB means of ﬂuorescent proteins.
The cells will be seeded on ground in multiwell plate units (MPUs), transported to the ISS, and
irradiated by an artiﬁcial radiation source after an adaptation period at 0 x g and 1 x g. After different
incubation periods, the cells will be ﬁxed by pumping a formaldehyde solution into the MPUs. Ground
control samples will be treated in the same way. For implementation of CELLRAD in the Biolab on the
International Space Station (155), tests of the hardware and the biological systems were performed. The
sequence of different steps in MPU fabrication (cutting, drilling, cleaning, growth surface coating, and
sterilization) was optimized in order to reach full biocompatibility. Different coatings of the foil used
as growth surface revealed that coating with 0.1 mg/ml poly—D—lysine supports cell attachment better
than collagen type I. The tests of prototype hardware (Science Model) proved its full functionality for
automated medium change, irradiation and ﬁxation of cells. Exposure of HEK cells to the ,B—rays emitted
by the radiation source dose—dependently decreased cell growth and increased NF—KB activation. The
signal of the ﬂuorescent proteins after formaldehyde ﬁxation was stable for at least six months after
ﬁxation, allowing storage of the MPUs after ﬁxation for several months before the transport back to Earth
and evaluation of the ﬂuorescence intensity. In conclusion, these tests show the feasibility of CELLRAD on
the 155 with the currently available transport mechanisms.

Fig. 2. CELLRAD hardware. The ECDS is closed with four screws and two latches (A). After removing the outer cover, the inner container (IHC) becomes visible (B). Detaching
the inner cover results in opening the ECDS and exposes the liquid tank, the EXU frame containing the MPUs, the pumps and the tubes (C). Removing the EXU frame with
all attached components uncovers the slide door with the radiation source below (D). In the MPUs, the medium is transported from well to well via the liquid channels in

Fig. 6. Inﬂuence of the closing of lumox® wells by different materials during the production process of the MPUs on cell growth in the fully—machined MPUs. During cutting
and drilling of the lumox® plates to produce MPUs consisting of 18 wells, black dust was produced (D). To determine which materials are appropriate to hinder the dust
from entering the wells during the production, three different materials (#1 impermeable seal, #2 gas permeable seal, #3 sealing mat) were tested. In the fully—machined
MPUs, half of the wells were coated with poly—D—lysine before and after the y—sterilization of the MPUs, the other half only before sterilization. The HEK—pEGFP—Nl 1 cells
were incubated for 5 days and green ﬂuorescence was scanned before ﬁxation (E). The mean EGFP ﬂuorescence (A, living cells, B, ﬁxed cells) and bisbenzimide ﬂuorescence
