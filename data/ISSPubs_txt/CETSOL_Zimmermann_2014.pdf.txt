Abstract. This paper gives an overview of the experiments on-board the International Space Station
(188) performed so far by the CETSOL team. A1-7 wt% Si alloys with and without grain reﬁners
were solidiﬁed in microgravity. Detailed grain structure analysis showed columnar growth in case
of non-reﬁned alloy, but the existence of a columnar t0 equiaxed transition (CET) in refined alloy.
One main result is a sharp CET when increasing the solidiﬁcation velocity and a progressive CET
for lowering the temperature gradient. Applying a front tracking model this behavior was conﬁrmed
numerically for sharp CET. Using a CAFE model both segregation and grain structures were
numerically modeled and show a fair agreement with the experimental findings.
Introduction

In most casting processes of metallic alloys a competition between the growth of several arrays
of dendrites results in characteristic grain structures. Therefore, depending on the process
parameters, columnar 0r equiaxed grain growth or a transition from columnar t0 equiaxed grains
(CET) exists [1-4]. The effect of CET was intensively investigated in the last decades because it’s
of high relevance in industrial application. Therefore, several computational models of the CET
were developed, like volume-averaged models calculating the transport phenomena 0n the scale of
an entire casting [5-7], meso—scale models tracking the growth of the envelope of each individual
grain [8-10] or micro-scale and phase ﬁeld models resolving details of the solid-liquid interface [11,
12]. In spite of the fact that these numerical models are able to describe the CET quite well, there
are some shortcomings in the modeling studies. Moreover, in the presence of a gravitational field,
settling 0r ﬂoatation of solid particles in the melt and their interaction with the development of the
columnar grain structure as well as natural convection 0f the melt itself must be taken into account
in order to predict the grain structure of a casting.

Here, a microgravity environment allows for suppression of buoyancy-driven melt ﬂow and
therefore for growth of equiaxed grains free of sedimentation and buoyancy effects. Experiments in
microgravity provide unique data for testing fundamental theories of grain structure formation. To
carry out such experiments and to model the process of columnar t0 equiaxed transition is the topic
of the research project Qolumnar-tO-Equiaxed Transition in SOLidiﬁcation Processing (CETSOL)
in the framework of the Microgravity Application Bromotion (MAP) programme of the European
Space Agency (ESA). This programme was initiated more than 10 years ago and continuously
driven by scientiﬁc teams as well as interested industries from several European countries. In the

last years several solidification experiments were performed successfully in the Low Gradient
Furnace insert of the Materials Science Lab (MSL-LGF) onboard the International Space Station
(188). This paper summarizes main results of these experiments.

Experimental set—up of the microgravity experiments

In microgravity environment, siX samples from Al-7wt%Si alloy (reﬁned and non-reﬁned) were
processed [13]. The rOd-like samples of diameter 7.8 mm and length 245.0 mm were integrated in
alumina crucibles. To measure the aXial temperature distribution along the sample twelve
thermocouples (TC1 t0 TC12) are located at positions ranging from (TC1) 72.5 mm to (TC12)
182.5 mm in 10 mm distances at the outside of the crucible, defined from the cold end of the
samples. A conical shaped Shapal plug acts as passive volume compensation device during heating-
up and melting of the alloy. This whole set-up is inserted leak—tight in a tantalum tube ﬁlled with
200 mbar helium and is labeled as Sample Cartridge Assembly (MSL-SCA) [13]. For sample
processing the MSL-SCA set-up is inserted into the MSL-LGF furnace, which consists of a ‘eold
zone” with 3 heaters, a ‘hot zone” with 4 heaters, separated by an ‘adiabatie zone”. By controlling
the temperatures of the cold and the hot zone a temperature gradient along the sample aXis is
applied. Melting and solidification of the metallic alloy is realized by a movement of the furnace
insert along the axis of the ﬁxed sample with a defined speed.

The main solidiﬁcation parameters of the ﬂight experiments are summarized in Table 1. In FM1,
FM2, FM5 and FM6 refined Al-7 wt% Si alloys with a commercial refiner Al-5wt%Ti-1wt%B
were solidiﬁed. In FM3 and FM4, non-refined Al-7 wt% Si alloy was chosen. Directional
solidiﬁcation began after different thermal homogenization times [14]. A long homogenization time
of 18000 s was used to study the effect of temperature gradient zone melting (TGZM) [15, 16]. In
the ﬁrst solidiﬁcation phase directional solidiﬁcation was initiated by raising the pulling velocity of
the furnace from 0 mm/s to V1 = 0.01 mm/s within a temperature gradient of about 1 K/mm. This
phase lasted for 2000 s and was identical for all ﬂight experiments. In solidification phase 2, the
temperature of the hot zone was decreased with a cooling rate of -0.067 K/s. This was achieved
while keeping unchanged the pulling velocity of the furnace for FM4, FM5 and FM6. In the ease of
FM1, FM2 and FM3 a velocity jump from V1 = 0.01 mm/s to V2 = 0.20 mm/s was suddenly induced
at the same time as the temperature decrease of the hot zone. Finally, both a shut-down 0f the
heaters and a fast movement of the furnace were applied to complete solidiﬁcation.

Sample Analysis

To analyze the overall quality of the processed samples with respect to porosity or defects non-
destructive computer tomography was used. The spatial resolution of about 25 um allows the
reconstruction of a 3D volume model of each sample. As a result only in samples FM1 and FMS,
having short homogenization times, some small pores with diameters less than 0.5 mm were
detected, which do not inﬂuence the solidiﬁcation behavior significantly.

For analyzing the microstructure and the grain structure the samples were sectioned [13]. First,
the samples were out into pieces of length 30 mm to analyze the transversal oross-seotions. Second,
each of these pieces was sawed along the aXis to get two halves for analysis of the longitudinal
oross-seotions.

To determine the dendritio miorostruoture the samples were polished, slightly etched and
observed with a microscope. From these longitudinal oross-seotions also the distributions of eutectic
and dendrite arm spacing (DAS) were analyzed [17]. To identify the grain structure qualitatively the
oross-seotions were etched electrolytically and analyzed in a polarized light microscope. Then,
different colors represent different orientations of the dendritio grains [18]. For quantitative
determination of crystallographic orientations of the grains, Electron BaokSoattered Diffraction
(EBSD) patterns were made from selected longitudinal oross-seotions. These data were used to
evaluate the 3D-orystallographio orientations of the grains with respect to the solidification
direction and to evaluate the distributions of sizes and shapes of the grains in the 2D sections.
Results of microgravity experiments with non-reﬁned Al—7wt%Si alloy

Fig. 1 shows maps of the dendritio microstructure and the grain structure in non-reﬁned Al-
7wt%Si sample FM3 revealed by electrolytic polishing and polarized-light optical microscopy. The
upper row gives radial oross-seotions (Q2 — Q4) at different sample positions 2. Longitudinal cross-
seotions L3 and L4 in between Q2 and Q3, and Q3 and Q4 are shown in the lower row. The
solidiﬁcation direction was from left to right.

Cross-seotion Q2, as well as the left part of longitudinal oross-seotion L3, shows the
polycrystalline mushy zone region. As a result of the long thermal homogenization of 18000 s in a
temperature gradient coarsening of the primary Al-rioh dendrites eXists. Cross-seotion Q3, as well
as the right part of L3 and the left part of L4 reveal competitive growth of columnar dendrites
originating from several pre-eXisting grains in the non-fully melted region according to a
solidiﬁcation with V1= 0.01 mm/s (see Table 1). The increase in the solidiﬁcation velocity to
V2 = 0.20 mm/s results in a maintenance of columnar growth but with reduced dendrite spacing.
This is demonstrated in oross-seotion Q4 and in the right part of L4. Detailed analysis shows [17]
that in solidiﬁcation phase 1 a locally high quantity of eutectic correlates with large dendrite arm
spacing (DAS). In solidification phase 2, both eutectic quantity and DAS were reduced due to the
ﬁner dendritio structure. Additionally, it should be noted that during solidification with
V2 = 0.20 mm/s, small grains with significant misorientations were found (see Q4). Therefore,
despite pure diffusive growth condition some amount of fragmentation eXists [17].

Results of microgravity experiments with reﬁned Al-7wt%Si alloy

The recorded cooling curves of the thermocouples TC1 to TC12 are shown in Fig. 2 for samples
FM1 and FMS. The time scale here starts at beginning of the ﬁrst solidification phase, then at
t = 2000 s the second phase starts (see Table 1). Additionally, the corresponding furnace positions s
are given. For FM1 (and also for FM2) mainly an increase of the solidiﬁcation velocity from
V1 = 0.01 mm/s to V2 = 0.20 mm/s is expected to trigger CET, whereas for FMS (and also for FM6)
a reduction of the temperature gradient is applied. For further evaluation an averaged interface
temperature of 612 0C is used. This takes into account some front undercooling [2] and also the fact
that the temperature inside the alloy is somewhat higher than the measured one at the crucible. Such
a value was already used in similar microgravity experiments [7].

When the 612 OC-isotherm reaches a thermocouple. At this time the local cooling rate at this
thermocouple in a time interval of i 60 s is determined. Also, from the temperature difference
measured between this thermocouple and the closest next thermocouple, knowing the distances
between neighboring thermocouples 0f 10 mm, the temperature gradient ahead of the interface is
calculated. From temperature gradient and cooling rate the local isotherm velocity is determined
(Fig. 3).

Fig. 3: Local temperature gradient and isotherm velocity during solidiﬁcation phases for samples
FM1, FM2, FMS and FM6 (t = 0 s corresponds to the beginning of furnace movement With
V1 = 0.01 mm/s and at t = 2000 s starts solidiﬁcation phase 2)

The temperature gradient is nearly constant at G = 0.95 i 0.1 K/mm in the ﬁrst solidiﬁcation
phase With V1 = 0.01 mm/s. In experiments FM1 and FM2 a second solidiﬁcation phase With a
furnace movement of V2 = 0.20 mm/s and a simultaneous cooling down of the heater temperatures
With 0.067 K/s for 250 s followed. In this phase a slight decrease of the temperature gradient to
about 0.6 K/mm is measured. A further decrease is related to the “fast movement” (see Table 1). In
experiments FMS and FM6 a second solidiﬁcation phase With an unchanged furnace velocity for
another 2000 s and a simultaneous cooling down of the heater temperatures With 0.067 K/s was
applied (see Table 1). In this phase a smooth decrease of the temperature gradient to about
0.5 K/mm eXists before the sample is completely solidiﬁed. A qualitatively similar behaviour is
determined for the local interface velocity. In the second solidiﬁcation phase in experiments FM1
and FM2 the velocity reaches about the value V = 0.20 mm/s, given by the furnace movement. In
experiments FMS and FM6 the increase is much lower.

Fig. 4 shows maps of the grain structure in reﬁned A1-7 wt% Si samples FM1, FM2, FMS and
FM6 identiﬁed by electrolytic polishing and polarized-light optical microscopy. The longitudinal
cross-sections (L4) reveal the transition region from columnar growth (left part of each cross-
section) to equiaxed growth.

solidiﬁcation (here from left to right). The grey level is related to the misorientation angles. Black
color means 110 misorientation (00), Whereas White color belongs to maximum misorientation
(54.740). The orientation maps indicate a sharp transition from columnar growth With two grains to
many equiaxed grains With fully random orientations in the cross-section L4 0f FM2, and a rather
smooth transition in case of FM6.

ratio of the length of the major aXis to the length of the minor aXis of each grain, intersecting
orthogonally at the centroid of the grain. In Liu et al. [17] the grain structure is labeled ‘equiaxed’ in
case the elongation factor is lower than 2 according to considerations developped by Hunt [19].
Analysis of FMS shows that the averaged elongation factor stays above 2 up to about 2 = 156 mm
[17]. Therefore, this position corresponds well With the end position for CET determined by the
analysis of the grain size.

The CET-positions for all samples are summarized in Table 2. Also the CET-positions
normalized to the initial solid-liquid interface position at t = 0 s are given. Within the measurement
error the beginning positions for CET in all samples are the same (2 = 55 - 57 mm), Whereas the end
positions depend of the type of CET, either sharp (z = 60 - 61 mm), or progressive (z = 83 mm).

The major reason responsible for this progressive CET in FM5 and FM6 is the low pulling
velocity of V1 = 0.01 mm/s. Newly nucleated grains in the undereooled melt grow a relatively long
distance before the maximum undereooling in front of the tips reaches the critical nucleation
temperature necessary for the nucleation of new grains. If gradually repeated nucleation events
predominate, an intermediate zone with a coexistence of elongated and equiaxed grains forms
which postpones the CET [17]. At CET, a fast repeated nucleation of grains exists which competes
over the continued growth of existing grains to form a truly equiaxed zone [20].

Numerical modelling

The experimental results obtained from the microgravity experiments are used for development
and improvement of numerical modelling.

An approach that combines front tracking of columnar growth and an equiaxed volume
averaging method was employed to simulate both the FM2 and FM3 experiments. In FM2 sample
the possibility of equiaxed nucleation from grain reﬁners in the undereooled liquid ahead of the
advancing columnar front is considered. The CET position is predicted at a distance 2 = 127.5 mm,
which corresponds rather well with the experimental value of z = 124 - 128 mm. In the non-reﬁned
sample FM3 however, no CET was found, both in the simulations and in the experiment. Further
details have been published in [13, 14 and 21].

AXi-symmetric simulations also were carried out using two-dimensional cellular automaton -
ﬁnite element modeling [22, 23]. Modelling of nucleation and growth of the grain structure is
performed together with segregation. Fig. 7 shows the simulated grain structure of experiments
FM1 and FM5, using reﬁned alloys. In that case, the same values of the nucleation parameters are
used for all simulations, i.e. Gaussian distribution of the heterogeneous particles with an average
undereooling of 4 CC, a standard deviation of 0.5 °C and a maximum density of 5-1010 m'3. As a
consequence, the differences in CET are only due to the solidiﬁcation conditions. The occurrence of
a columnar zone at the beginning of solidiﬁcation phase 1 is observed, followed by the nucleation
of new grains and the formation of an equiaxed zone. The simulated equiaxed grain density
increases with the cooling rate. The grain structure evolution in both experiments is well retrieved
by the simulations and also conﬁrms the type of CET, sharp or progressive.

Conclusion

This paper gives an overview of the experiments performed so far on-board the International Space
Station (188) by the CETSOL team. In the Materials Science Laboratory, Al-7 wt% Si alloys with
and without grain reﬁners were solidiﬁed in difﬁasive conditions. Detailed grain structure analysis
showed columnar growth in case of non-reﬁned alloy, but the existence of a columnar t0 equiaxed
transition in reﬁned alloy. Main result is a sharp CET when increasing the solidification velocity
and a progressive CET for lowering the temperature gradient. Applying a front tracking model this
behavior was conﬁrmed numerically. Using a CAFE model both segregation and grain structures,
as well as CET, were numerically modeled and show a fair agreement with the experimental
ﬁndings. In future, more experiments on-board the 188 will be performed with different process
parameters to broaden the data basis. In parallel, numerical 3D-m0deling of grain growth is in
progress [24, 25].
