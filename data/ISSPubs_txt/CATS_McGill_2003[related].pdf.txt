[1] The Cloud Physics Lidar (CPL) operated onboard the NASA ER-2 high-altitude
aircraft during the Southern African Regional Science Initiative (SAFARI)—2000 ﬁeld
campaign. The CPL provided high spatial resolution estimates of aerosol optical properties
at both 1064 and 532 nm. We present here results of planetary boundary layer (PBL)
aerosol optical depth analysis and proﬁles of aerosol extinction. Variation of optical depth
and extinction are examined as a function of regional location. The wide-seale aerosol
mapping obtained by the CPL is a unique data set that will aid in future studies of aerosol
transport. Comparisons between the airborne CPL and ground-based Miero-Pulse Lidar
Network (MPL-Net) sites are shown to have good agreement. INDEX TERMS: 0305
