Abstract
The ALTEA program is an international and multi—disciplinary collaboration aimed at studying particle radiation in space enVi—
ronment and its effects on astronauts, in particular the anomalous perception of Light Flashes. This paper describes ALTEA space
facility scheduled to ﬂy in the International Space Station (ISS) after J uly 2006, What kind of data are produced and how data are
transmitted to Earth, processed and analyzed.
