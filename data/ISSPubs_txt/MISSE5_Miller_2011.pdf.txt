It is known that polymer ﬁlms can degrade as a result of space environmental exposure, but the magnitude of the
mechanical property degradation and the degree to which the different environmental factors play a role is not well
understood. An experiment was ﬂown on the Materials International Space Station Experiment 5 to determine the
change in tensile strength and percent elongation of some typical polymer ﬁlms exposed in a nadir-facing
environment on the International Space Station and, where possible, compare with similar ram- and wake-facing
experiments ﬂown on the Materials International Space Station Experiment 1 to get a better indication of the role the
different environments play in mechanical property change. It was found that the majority of the polymers tested
experienced some loss in tensile/yield strength and percent elongation with polytetraﬂuroethylene Teﬂon having the
greatest change. Where comparisons could be made with the Materials International Space Station Experiment 1, it
appears that the loss in percent elongation is dependent on the radiation level while the loss in tensile strength is not as
sensitive to the level of radiation.
