ABSTRACT

Exercise has shown little success in mitigating bone loss from long-duration spaceflight. The first crews of the International Space Station
(ISS) used the “interim resistive exercise device” (iRED), which allowed loads of up to 297 Ibf (or 1337 N) but provided |itt|e protection
of bone or no greater protection than aerobic exercise. In 2008, the Advanced Resistive Exercise Device (ARED), which allowed
absolute loads of up to 600 Ibf (1675 N), was launched to the ISS. We report dietary intake, bone densitometry, and biochemical markers
in 13 crewmembers on ISS missions from 2006 to 2009. Of these 13, 8 had access to the iRED and 5 had access to the ARED. In both
groups, bone-specific alkaline phosphatase tended to increase during flight toward the end of the mission (p = 0.06) and increased 30
days after landing (p< 0.001). Most markers of bone resorption were also increased in both groups during flight and 30 days after
landing (p < 0.05). Bone densitometry revealed significant interactions (time and exercise device) for pelvis bone mineral density (BMD)
and bone mineral content (p < 0.01), hip femoral neck BMD (p < 0.05), trochanter BMD (p < 0.05), and total hip BMD (p < 0.05). These
variables were unchanged from preflight only for ARED crewmembers, who also returned from flight with higher percent lean mass and
lower percent fat mass. Body mass was unchanged after flight in both groups. All crewmembers had nominal vitamin D status
(75 i 17 nmol/L) before and during flight. These data document that resistance exercise, coupled with adequate energy intake (shown
by maintenance of body mass determined by dual-energy X—ray absorptiometry [DXA]) and vitamin D, can maintain bone in most
regions during 4— to 6-month missions in microgravity. This is the first evidence that improving nutrition and resistance exercise during
spaceflight can attenuate the expected BMD deficits previously observed after prolonged missions. © 2012 American Society for Bone

Fig. 4. Bone mineral density (BMD) and body composition (expressed as % change per month i SD) in crewmembers on the Russian space station Mir,
on earlier ISS flights (iRED, Expeditions 1—13), and reported in this work (iRED, Expeditions14—18, and ARED). Femoral neck, trochanter, and pelvis changes
are for the left hip for the iRED and ARED subjects. The Mir data have been published in other reports.(4'15) (A) Spine BMD. (B) Femoral neck BMD.
