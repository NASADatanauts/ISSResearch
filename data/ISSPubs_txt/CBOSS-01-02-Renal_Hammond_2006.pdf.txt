Compared to experiments utilizing humans in

microgravity, eell-based approaches to questions Increasing Protein Content

about subsystems of the human system afford

multiple advantages, such as crew safety and the 10

ability to achieve statistical signiﬁcance. To 9

maximize the science return from ﬂight samples, an ‘5; 3

optimized method was developed to recover protein S; 6

from samples depleted of nucleic acid. This E, 5

technique allows multiple analyses on a single § 4

cellular sample and when applied to future cellular E 3

investigations could accelerate solutions to n' 2

signiﬁcant biomedical barriers to human space (1)
