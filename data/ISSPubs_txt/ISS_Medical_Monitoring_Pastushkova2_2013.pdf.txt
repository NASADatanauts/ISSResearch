Abstract
The urine protein composition samples of ten Russian cosmonauts (male, aged of 35 up to 51) performed long flight
missions and varied from 169 up to 199 days on the International Space Station (ISS) were analyzed. As a control group,
urine samples of six back—up cosmonauts were analyzed. We used proteomic techniques to obtain data and contemporary
bioinformatics approaches to perform the analysis. From the total number of identified proteins (238) in our data set, 129
were associated with a known tissue origin. Preflight samples contained 92 tissue-specific proteins, samples obtained on
Day 1 after landing had 90 such proteins, while Day 7 samples offered 95 tissue-specific proteins. Analysis showed that
consistently present proteins in urine (under physiological conditions and after space flight) are cubilin, epidermal growth
factor, kallikrein—1, kininogen—1, megalin, osteopontin, vitamin K—dependent protein Z, uromodulin. Variably present
proteins consists of: Na(+)/K(+) ATPase subunit gamma, B-defensin-1, dipeptidyl peptidase 4, maltasa-glucoamilasa,
cadherin-Iike protein, neutral endopeptidase and vascular cell adhesion protein 1. And only three renal proteins were
related to the space flight factors. They were not found in the pre-flight samples and in the back—up cosmonaut urine, but
were found in the urine samples after space flight: AFAM (afamin), AMPE (aminopeptidase A) and AQP2 (aquaporin-2). This
data related with physiological readaptation of water-salt balance. The proteomic analysis of urine samples in different
phases of space missions with bioinformation approach to protein identification provides new data relative to
biomechemical mechanism of kidney functioning after space flight.
