found that the position of AZT differs remarkably from the

positions of the pyrimidine bases and nucleoside analogues

in other known complexes of pyrimidine phosphorylases, but

coincides well with the position of 2’-ﬂu0r0-3’-azid0-2’,3’-

dideoxyuridine (N3FddU) in the recently investigated

complex of E. coli TP with this ligand (Timofeev et al.,

2013). The peculiarities of the arrangement of N3FddU and

3’-azid0thymidine in the nucleoside binding pocket of TP and

correlations between the arrangement and inhibitory proper-

ties of these compounds are discussed.

1. Introduction

Thymidine phosphorylases (TPs; EC 2.4.2.4) are key enzymes

in nucleoside metabolism. In the presence of inorganic phos-

phate, they catalyze the reversible phosphorolysis 0f the

glycosidic bond in thymidine- and uridine-Z’-deoxyrib0sides,

with the formation of free base and deoxyribose 1-ph0sphate

(Walter et al., 1990; Bicknell & Harris, 1996). The reaction

between nucleoside and phosphate ions bound to the enzyme

in the nucleoside and phosphate binding pockets, respectively,

proceeds by means of the nucleophilic attack of the phosphate

0 atom on the C1’ atom of the deoxyribose ring (Schwartz,

1971; Rick er aL, 1999).

In addition to phosphorolysis, thymidine phosphorylases

catalyze the transfer of the deoxyribosyl moiety from one

pyrimidine base to another. This transglycosylation reaction

plays a key role in the salvage pathway of nucleoside
