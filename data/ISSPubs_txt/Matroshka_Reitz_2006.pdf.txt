THE MATROSHKA FACILITY—DOSE DETERMINATION
DURING AN EVA

51147 Cologne, Germany
On 29 J anuary 2004 the MATROSHKA facility was launched with a Russian Progress to the International Space Station. U
MATROSHKA is an ESA project, which has been achieved under the direction of the German Aerospace Center (DLR). The 0
project is a cooperation of >16 research institutes from all over the world and is currently the biggest international experiment E
in radiation dosimetry ever performed in space. The facility simulates, as exact as possible, an astronaut during an g
extravehicular activity. It was successfully installed outside the Russian segment ‘Zvezda’ on 26 February 2004 and will %
remain there for a 1.5 year exposure period. The main task of the facility is to measure particle ﬂuence and energy spectra, ;
dose and dose rates outside and inside—including organ dose determination—in an anthropomorphic phantom mounted on the 5
outside of the Space Station with passive and active dosemeter systems. E
