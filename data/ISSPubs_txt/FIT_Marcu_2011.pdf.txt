Abstract
Alterations and impairment of immune responses in humans present a health risk for space exploration missions. The
molecular mechanisms underpinning innate immune defense can be confounded by the complexity of the acquired
immune system of humans. Drosophila (fruit fly) innate immunity is simpler, and shares many similarities with human innate
immunity at the level of molecular and genetic pathways. The goals of this study were to elucidate fundamental immune
processes in Drosophila affected by spaceflight and to measure host-pathogen responses post-flight. Five containers, each
containing ten female and five male fruit flies, were housed and bred on the space shuttle (average orbit altitude of
330.35 km) for 12 days and 18.5 hours. A new generation of flies was reared in microgravity. In larvae, the immune system
was examined by analyzing plasmatocyte number and activity in culture. In adults, the induced immune responses were
analyzed by bacterial clearance and quantitative rea|-time polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) of selected genes following
infection with E. coli. The RNA levels of relevant immune pathway genes were determined in both larvae and adults by
microarray analysis. The ability of larval plasmatocytes to phagocytose E. coli in culture was attenuated following
spaceflight, and in parallel, the expression of genes involved in cell maturation was downregulated. In addition, the level of
constitutive expression of pattern recognition receptors and opsonins that specifically recognize bacteria, and of lysozymes,
antimicrobial peptide (AMP) pathway and immune stress genes, hallmarks of humoral immunity, were also reduced in
larvae. In adults, the efficiency of bacterial clearance measured in vivo following a systemic infection with E. coli post—flight,
remained robust. We show that spaceflight altered both cellular and humoral immune responses in Drosophila and that the
disruption occurs at multiple interacting pathways.
