of 108008 (180 min) in the case of the ULF spectral power density. All intervals were progressively displaced by 5min throughout the
record. In View of the longer interval used for ULF, the start time is 90 min later than that for VLF, LF and HF along the time axis. A right
black bar indicates the sleeping time. Figures a—d show results for one subject (ID01) Who developed strong bradycardia at DF1
(NN intervals increased by more than 10%). Figures e—h present results from another subject (ID04), Who developed mild bradycardia at
DF1. Figures i—l portray results of yet another subject (ID05), Who developed mild tachycardia at DF1. H I E H T E L | M Ell}

intervals (left) and circadian waveform (right) during DF3. (g) Post-NN intervals for 24h after return to Earth. (h) Frequency-domain
analysis of NN intervals (left) and circadian waveform (right) post-ﬂight. Time is shown on the horizontal aXis and NN intervals on the
vertical axis. A white bar indicates the sleeping time. In this case, after falling asleep, NN intervals gradually extended to 800—900 ms, and
shortened to 700 ms after getting up. In the left panel, the power-spectral density (PSD h/min/min) is plotted as a function of frequency
(cycles/h). Detected components have periods of 22.71 h and 11.80h (about half of 22.71 h), accounting for 31.6 and 34.9% of the total
power (variance), respectively. They represent the circadian rhythm characterizing NN intervals. In addition, 7.31-h and 5.30-h
components were also detected. The signal reconstructed (at 5-min intervals) based on these four components (accounting for 80.5% of the
total power) fitted to the NN intervals by least-squares is shown with the original data (right panel), illustrating the circadian variation in
the data. At one month after launch (DFI), NN intervals varied around 700 ms when awake, similar to pre-ﬂight, but lengthened to 900—
1100 ms during sleep, which is longer than during pre-ﬂight. A transient drop in NN intervals is observed from 18:30 to 19:00 during
exercise, recovering thereafter. The MEM analysis (left) detects two peaks corresponding to periods of 26.79h (51.9% power) and 12.93h
(23.3% power), approximately half a day. The circadian waveform thus reconstructed (at 5-min intervals) by the least-squares fit of cosine
curves with these periods to the data are shown with the original data (right). During DF3, NN intervals average about 700 ms while awake,
prolonged to 850—1000 rns during sleep, and shortened to 500—600 ms at the time of awakening. The MEM analysis (left) detects two major
peaks corresponding to periods of 24.00h (35.6% power) and 11.68h (30.2% power) (left), very close to 24 and 12h, suggesting that the
biological clock mechanism that modulates the circadian rhythm recovered from the disruption associated with the ﬂight. The
reconstructed signal (right) shows a clear circadian variation. In the Post-term, NN intervals averaged 800—950 rns during sleep, similar to
pre-ﬂight and much less prolonged than in space. In this case, the sleep span was very short (about 3.5 h). The MEM analysis (left) detects
two peaks with periods of 18.17 h (16.4% power) and 9.34 h (39.8% power), and barely any other periodic components. Although these peaks
were clearly detected, their spectral density was low. Overall, the spectral power was markedly decreased. The 9.34-h component was the
most prominent. A clear circadian pattern could not be observed from the reconstructed signal (right). I: I E III 1- E L | I... Hi}
