Abstract
We present a design of an optical cell dedicated to study the water properties near the liquid-gas critical point using the
DECLIC-CNES instrument on board the International Space Station. This designed cell satisﬁes safety requirements for
high pressure and high temperature operating conditions of the high temperature insert (HTI). This design is optimized
for using high-resolution and high—speed optical diagnostics, local temperature controls and measurements of the
DECLIC instrument, in particular to observe and to analyze the thermal and density response of critical water after a
transient heating produced by one heat pulse actuator. Illustrations of the high-level performances are provided by the
preliminary results obtained during the Earth’s tests of the ﬂight model of the HTI insert.
