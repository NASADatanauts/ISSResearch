Abstract: The use Of the Mahalanobis distance in a lookup table approach
to retrieval of in-water Inherent Optical Properties (IOPs) led to signiﬁcant
improvements in the accuracy of the retrieved IOPs, as high as 50% in
some cases, With an average improvement of 20% over a Wide range of case
11 waters. Previous studies have shown that inherent noise in hyperspectral
data can cause signiﬁcant errors in the retrieved IOPs. For LUT-based
retrievals that rely on spectrum matching, the particular metric used for
spectral comparisons has a signiﬁcant effect on the accuracy of the results,
especially in the presence of noise in the data. In this study, we have
compared the Euclidean distance and the Mahalanobis distance as metrics
for spectral comparison. In addition to providing justiﬁcation for the
preference of the Mahalanobis Distance over the Euclidean Distance, we
have also included a statistical description of noisy hyperspectral data.

1. Introduction

Historically, most of ocean color analysis has centered on estimating chl-a concentration (as a
proxy for algal biomass) from satellite data. While the determination of algal biomass is a key
aspect of monitoring the ecological status of a water body, several scientiﬁc and military
purposes require analysis that goes beyond merely estimating chl-a concentration and
requires the retrieval of other optically active components in water and the Characteristics of
the substratum. For example, determining the sediment concentration in the surface layer
helps assess the availability and transmission of light into deeper layers, Which is a crucial
parameter in deriving energy budgets for primary production studies; Characterizing the
bottom type and bathyrnetry is important for many purposes, such as maritime navigation,
underwater geologic studies, global Climate studies, habitat management, seafood safety
control, coastal erosion control, etc.

Numerous empirically-driven and analytically-driven algorithms have been developed for
retrieving in-water and under—water characteristics from satellite data, With varying degrees of
success in the achieved accuracy. Contrary to open-ocean waters, the coastal, estuarine, and
inland waters are often optically complex due to the relative abundance of other optically
active components besides phytoplankton, and are conventionally categorized as Case 11
waters [1]. The optical properties of Case 11 waters are not directly correlated to the
concentration of phytoplankton alone. Therefore, spectral algorithms for retrieving a
particular biophysical parameter in such waters are prone to effects due to variations in other
parameters. For example, blue-green algorithms for estimating chlorophyll-a (chl-a)
concentration do not perform well in Case 11 waters due to absorption by colored dissolved
organic matter (CDOM) in the blue spectral region (e.g., [2, 3]). Algorithms relying on
reﬂectances in the red and near infrared (NIR) regions have been preferred for retrieving ch1-
a concentration in Case 11 waters because of the diminished effects of absorption by CDOM
and scattering by Suspended Particulate Matter (SPM) in the red and NIR wavelengths (e.g.,
[4, 5]). Nevertheless, algorithms based on band ratios in the red and NIR wavelengths still
assume uniform absorption and scattering by non-algal components at the wavelengths of
interest. This assumption breaks down in cases of low chl-a and high SPM concentrations,
causing signiﬁcant errors in the estimated chl-a concentration (e.g., [6]). Modiﬁed NIR-red
algorithms have been developed to handle the non-uniforrn scattering by SPM in the red and
NIR regions [7, 8]. Even though such algorithms have been shown to yield accurate results
for very highly turbid waters from speciﬁc geographic regions, their applicability to waters
from various geographic regions With varying biophysical Characteristics is yet to be proven.

Comprehensive analysis of coastal, estuarine, and inland ecosystems require the retrieval
of multiple in-water and under—water Characteristics. Algorithms based on a Look—Up—Table
(LUT) approach (e.g., [9]) can retrieve multiple parameters simultaneously and, When
properly designed, are less prone to adverse effects of the dominance of a few parameters
over the rest. The Naval Research Laboratory in Washington, DC. has developed a LUT-
based Coastal Water Spectral Toolkit (CWST) for retrieving Inherent Optical Properties
(IOPs) of water, constituent concentrations, sediment type, bottom type, bottom reﬂectance,

matching approach that is based on spectral distances calculated between the input spectrum
and modeled spectra in a large database. The accuracy and reliability of this approach depend
signiﬁcantly on the metric used for calculating the spectral distances. In this paper, the use of
the Euclidean and the Mahalanobis distances are compared as the metric used in Choosing the
best-Inatehing spectrum, and demonstrate the beneﬁts of using the Mahalanobis distance
instead of the Euclidean distance.

2. Experimental description and methodology

2.] Look- Up-Table (L UT) based IOP retrieval

In order to implement a LUT-based model, one must generate in advance a large number of
modeled remote sensing reﬂectance (Rm) spectra, covering a wide range of bio-optieal
parameters, to ensure that each image spectrum can be matched to a modeled spectrum within
acceptable limits of accuracy. The CWST contains a very large database of modeled spectra,
generated using a wide variety of IOP parameters, bottom reﬂectance, depths, sediment types,
and phase functions. The forward model used for generating the spectra is Ecolight, which is
a simpliﬁed version of the radiative transfer model Hydrolight [10, 11]. The full set of
modeled data, currently comprising approximately 20 million unique Rm spectra, is stored in
a database for warehousing.

To run the IOP retrieval for a given image or set of individual spectra, the database is ﬁrst
reduced by limiting the ranges of the various input parameters to those appropriate for the
input spectra (for example, bottom types that are known to not eXist in the region from which
the input spectra were collected are omitted). This reduction in modeled spectra both
increases the speed of the analysis and reduces the Chance of incorrect matches that might
occur due to unusua1 combinations of input parameters that aren’t realistic for this region.
Each input spectrum is then compared to each of the modeled spectra in the (reduced)
database, and the spectral distance (according to some metric) is calculated. The modeled
spectrum that is Closest to the input spectrum is considered the best match, and the (known)
parameters corresponding to this spectrum are then assigned to the input spectrum.

2.2 Sensor noise modeling

In very general terms, the process of measuring a hyperspeetral spectrum in a CCD array is a
means of converting incoming light (photons) into ‘digital numbers’; sensor calibration is
then used to turn the digital numbers into radiance values. The total measured signal is a sum
of the incoming light and any sensor-generated noise. The latter terms include dark noise,
read noise, and digitization noise, and are independent of the incoming signal strength;
accurate Characterization of these terms for a given sensor is possible in the laboratory. The
incoming light is essentially a count of photons per unit time; this eountwi11vary as a Poisson
distribution with a standard deviation equal to the mean number of photons received. This
variation is usually referred to as photon (or ‘shot’) noise. When the incoming light is
signiﬁcantly large, the photon noise dominates the sensor noise and the data are said to be
‘ shot-noise limited’.

In this paper, we simulate real-world noisy measurements using the sensor model for
NRL’s Hyperspeetral Imager for the Coastal Ocean (HICO), which has been operating
continuously aboard the International Space Station since October 2009. The sensor is a 512 X
512 CCD array with a spectral range of 350-1080 nm and a spectral Channel width of 5.73
nm; the ground sampling distance is approximately 90m at nadir. Detailed Characterizations
of the sensor noise for HICO are available in [12]; a much more detailed description of the
noise modeling algorithm can be found in [13].

Only simulated data are used in the paper. Ideally, one would prefer to use actually
measured ﬁeld data. However, there is limited ability to collect a sufﬁcient number of in Situ

inferences. Through simulations it is possible to generate large data sets over any number of
conditions at intervals that are narrow enough to permit investigation of even small
biophysical Changes in water and still provide a reasonable estimate of how the algorithm will
perform With ﬁeld data.

To generate noisy samples, the following three-step procedure is used: starting With a
given Rm spectrum ,0 , an at-sensor radiance spectrum, L , is generated by using a forward
version of the Taﬂ<aa atmospheric correction algorithm [14, 15]. Next, a ‘noisy’ radiance
spectrum Ln =L+77 is generated by adding a zero-mean Gaussian noise spectrum 77; the
variance of the noise is determined by the noise model described in [13] and is independent of
the wavelengths. Finally, Taﬂ<aa is used to atmospherieally correct the data and produce a
noisy Rm spectrum ,0”.

Note that, by construction, the noisy radiance spectra form a Gaussian distribution With a
mean roughly equal to the noise-free spectrum and a covariance matrix ZR ; since the noise is
uncorrelated among wavelengths, the covariance matrix is diagonal. In general,, the
atmospheric correction algorithm is, to a very good approximation, an afﬁne mapping (that is,
,0” 2 AR” + b for some matrix A and vector 19 ), it follows that the distribution of the noisy
remote sensing reﬂectance ,0” Will also be Gaussian, With a mean equal to the noise-free
reﬂectance spectrum ,0 and a covariance matrix 2 = AZRAt . If we further assume that the
matrix A is diagonal — that is, no inelastic terms are included in the atmospheric correction —
then it follows that that the reﬂectance covariance matrix 2 is also diagonal.

2.3 Distance metrics
In order to run the CWST IOP retrieval, some metric must be deﬁned in order to calculate the
distance between the input and the database spectra. The most traditional Choice is the
standard 1east-squares (or L2 ) distance,

n 2 t

d(x,y)=Z(xi-y,-) =(x-y) ~(x-y) (1)

i=1
Where x, y are the spectra to be compared, xl,x2,...,xn are the values at the various
wavelengths, and n is the total number of wavelengths (0r bands) of the spectra.

An alternative metric is the statistical-based Mahalanobis distance (MD) [16], Which
measures the distance from a vector x to a given (multivariate) distribution (or set of points)
Y . Formally, if the mean and covariance of Y are ,uand Z , respectively, then the
Mahalanobis distance a’M (x) of x to Y is given by

t _
dM<x>=<x—u> -21-<x—u> <2)
For two vectors x, y , the MD can be generalized as
t _
dM(xay)=(x-y) E 1-(x-y) (3)
If the covariance matrix 2 is diagonal, With diagonal entries 012,...,0': , then the MD
formula simpliﬁes t0
dM (w) = Z—m —y,.) (4)
i=1 0-1“

"
"5","In this case, the Mahalanobis distance is simply a band-weighted version of L2, with weights
given by the inverse covariance of the band; in particular, ‘noisy’ bands (those with high
variance) will be weighted less than less-noisy bands.

3. Results

3 .1 [OP retrievals

The general setup of our experiment consists of ﬁrst generating noisy spectra from a given
Rm input, as described in Sec. 2.2 and running the LUT-based IOP inversion (Sec. 2.1) using
both the L2 and Mahalanobis distances and comparing the results.

To generate the noisy data, we began with a set of 52 optically-deep Rm spectra generated
by Ecolight over various levels of chl-a, CDOM, and SPM. All other parameters (phase
functions, sediment type, wind speed, etc.) were set ﬁxed for all generated spectra; each
spectrum was generated on a grid of 68 HICO wavelengths within the range 405 — 789 nm.
Each of the 52 noise-free spectra was then input into the noise model (Sec. 2.2) and for each
input 1000 noisy Rm samples generated, an example is shown in Fig. 1. In all cases, the
atmospheric conditions were held constant; a complete description of the atmospheric
parameters may be found in [13]. We also calculated the associated (sample) covariance
matrix for each input for use in the Mahalanobis distance calculations.

Next, we extracted a subset of the existing Rm library spectra from the full database. To
keep the comparison as simple as possible, we followed the model used to generate the noisy
data and only used optically deep spectra with varying amounts of chl-a, CDOM, and SPM;
the sediment type and scattering phase functions for both SPM and chl-a were also varied; all
other parameters (wind speed, solar zenith angle, etc.) were ﬁxed to the same values as for the
noisy input. An approximate overview of the various ranges and discretization values used in
the LUT for CWST is given in Table 1; 261,281 modeled spectra were used in the
comparison. The database spectra were originally generated on a wavelength grid of 350 -
790 nm at 5 nm resolution; in order to compare the spectra in the database with the noise-
modeled data, the former were resampled onto the HICO grid using cubic-spline
interpolation.

The next step was to run the CWST IOP inversion for each of the 52,000 noisy spectra,
once under each metric. To run the inversion, we simply ran a brute-force search on each
input spectrum, calculating the distance between the input and every database spectra, and
ﬁnding the minimum. The parameters corresponding to the database spectrum with the
minimum spectral distance from the input spectrum were then assigned to the input spectrum,
and the retrieved parameters were compared to the original, noise-free parameters. We note
that no attempt was made to optimize the search, and all calculations were done in the most

Mahalanobis distance search was approximately twice as long; however, on a modern
desktop, each version can be done quickly (on average, L2 search ran in approximately 0.15
seconds per input spectra while MD ran in approximately 0.30 seconds).

The main results are summarized in columns 4 and 5 of Table 2, which shows a simple
count of how many of each run of 1000 noisy spectra exactly matched the input spectrum —
that is, the retrieved values of all parameters were the same. As can be seen from the results,
the Mahalanobis distance outperforms the standard L2 distance for each of the 52 input
spectra. The improvement ranged from 2 to 50%, with an average improvement of
approximately 20%. It was noticed, somewhat surprisingly, that whenever the retrieved
concentrations of chl-a, CDOM (expressed in terms of the absorption coefﬁcient at 440 nm),
and SPM were correct, the other three free parameters — sediment type and both phase
functions — were also correct. It follows that the “number correct’ column is the same whether
we compare only chl-a, CDOM and SPM or all siX parameters.
The average relative error for the retrieved chl-a, CDOM and SPM values are shown in
columns 7 -12 of Table 2. The reported values are of the form

The reported relative error is the average error for all 1000 samples; negative errors mean that
the average retrieved value was higher than the actual input. In general, the average of the
MD-retrieved values was slightly closer to the true value, although in several instances the L2
values were better.

"8","In each case, it is important to note that the average value will be biased by the discrete
nature of the LUT; when constructing the database, a ‘step size’ must be chosen for each
parameter. The correct step size to use is itself a research topic [17]; it is also important to
remember that since the retrieval is done for all parameters simultaneously, the discretization
grid of any one parameter will impact the retrieval of the others as well. A more complete
analysis would include an examination of the distribution of each parameter in each input
‘bin’, as shown in Fig. 2. In general, the overall pattern was similar for each parameter; the
majority of the retrieved values exactly matched the true value; the remaining values were
within one or two step-units on either side (with a few occasional outliers).

3.2 T hearetical justiﬁcation
In order to gain an understanding of why the Mahalanobis distance outperforms L2 , an
examination of how the noisy data and database spectra are distributed under these two
metrics was performed.

From Sec. 2.2, it is reasonable to expect that the generated noisy spectra
X = {xl,x2,...,x1000} follow, to a very good approximation, a multivariate Gaussian
distribution with mean ,u = ,0 equal to the noise-free input, and diagonal covariance matrix
2 .

To test this, the distribution of the distances d (xi, ,0) between the noise-free and noisy
spectra, ,0 and xi, was calculated for both the Mahalanobis and L2 metrics, and the
experimental results were compared with the expected theoretical values.

If the data are assumed Gaussian, then it can be shown [18] that the MD reduces to the
sum of squared normal variables and therefore has a chi-squared distribution with n degrees
of freedom, where n is the number of wavelengths.

Similarly, under the same assumptions, the L2 distance Eq. (1) can be rewritten as

n 2 l 2
d(X,,0)=ZO'i ?(xi_pi) (5)
i=1 i
which is a weighted sum of chi-squared variables. By the Lyapunov version of the central
limit theorem [19], this is approximately Gaussian, with a mean Ltd 2 0'12 + - - - 0': and variance
0'3 22(014 +---+0:).

An example of the actual and ﬁtted distributions for one of the input spectra is shown in
Fig. 3 below. We note that each of the other 51 noise-free spectra lead to ﬁts that are
qualitatively similar to the example shown; although not necessarily conclusive, it appears
from this that the multivariate Gaussian distribution for the noisy data is reasonable.

An alternative, more geometrical View of the two distances can be obtained by examining
how the data are distributed in the spectral space. In general, the data will have a higher
‘spread’ along bands that have more noise, as shown in Fig. 4; as a result, the set of noisy data
tends to be more of an ellipsoid than a perfect sphere. From Eq. (4), for a ﬁxed value the
Mahalanobis distance deﬁnes an ellipsoid with axial lengths given by the band variances; in
contrast, for a ﬁxed distance L2 deﬁnes a sphere that is equidistant along each band as shown
in Fig. 4. Intuitively, the MD distance does a much better job of modeling the true spread of
the noisy data within the spectral space.

Fig. 4. Two-band scattergram 0f the noisy (left) and database (right) spectra. The red curve
represents the 3-sig1na range of the L2 distance; the black dotted curve is the 3-sig1na range
for MD. The bands shown are 422 and 571 nm.

With this in mind, it is useful to examine how many of the database spectra lie within the
same ‘range’ of the noise-free spectrum as the noisy spectra. From above, we know we can
estimate the distribution of the noisy spectra as a chi-squared (MD) or normal distribution
(L2 ); from this, we can estimate the range within which a given percentage of the noisy data
must fall. For example, under the normal distribution, we can estimate that approximately
85% 0f the data are less than one sigma above the mean, and about 99% 0f the data are less
than ,u + 2.330' . Similar results for the chi-squared distribution with a given degree of
freedom can be found Via tables or software-based cumulative distribution functions. In Table
3, we show the total number of noisy and database spectra that lie within the 85 / 99% ranges
of the noisy data; an example is shown in Fig. 4 (spectral space) and Fig. 5 (distance). In each
case, it can be seen that the number of ‘incorrect’ database spectra within the noise range
drops signiﬁcantly under MD; intuitively, this implies that the noisy data are ‘closer’ to the

Fig. 5. Distribution of the L2 (left) and Mahalanobis (right) distances in the noise range. The
dotted line represents the (ﬁtted) distribution of the noisy data; the bars represent the number
of database spectra at that distance. Note that the number of database spectra within the noise
range is signiﬁcantly smaller for the Mahalanobis distance.
Summary and future work
Noise, including sensor and shot noise, is inescapable in real-world data, and has been shown
previously [13] to strongly affect the accuracy of retrieved in-water constituents. In this work
we have shown that statistical modeling, including the use of the Mahalanobis distance to
compare spectra, can partially offset this effect and lead to improved retrievals.

Realistic sensor models were used to simulate noisy data; in particular, extensive
simulations were required to derive the (full) covariance matrix needed to use the
Mahalanobis distance. In order to reduce the computational complexity, a more efﬁcient
method of estimating the (diagonal) covariance is needed; we have recently begun an
examination of this problem and expect to present these results in the near future. We also
note that an accurate description of the noise levels and how they affect retrievals may be
used to help guide future sensor design.
