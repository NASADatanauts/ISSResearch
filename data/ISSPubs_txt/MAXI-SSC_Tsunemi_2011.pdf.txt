"2","1. Introduction

The ASCA satellite (Tanaka et a1. 1994) was the ﬁrst successful mission that carried
X—ray CCDs in photon counting Inode (Burke et a1. 1991). Since then, the X—ray CCDs in
photon counting Inode become the standard X—ray detectors for the X—ray astronomy Inissions.
Chandra (Weisskopf et a1. 2002) launched in 1999 carries the ACTS consisting of 10 CCD Chips
each of which is one inch square in imaging area. XMM—Newton launched in 1999 carries the
EPIC that consists of two CCD cameras: one is the MOS camera (Turner et a1. 2001) and the
other is the pn camera (Struder et a1. 2001). The MOS camera consists of 7 CCD Chips each
of which is 4 cm square. The pn camera has one CCD Chip that is 60m square. The Swift
satellite launched in 2004 (Gehrels et a1. 2004) carries one CCD Chip that is identical to those
of the MOS camera. The Suzaku satellite launched in 2005 carries the X18 (Koyaina et a1.
2007) consisting of 4 CCD Chips that are improved CCDs of the ACTS.

The MAXI (Monitor of All—sky X—ray Image, Matsuoka et a1. 2009) was planned in 1998
to be launched in 2003. There are two cameras: the Gas Slit Camera (GSC, Mihara et a1. 2010)
and the Solid—state Slit Camera (SSC). The SSC was proposed to be an array of X—ray CCD
onboard the MAXI. This is the slit camera: a kind of a pin hole camera. It carries 32 CCD Chips
each is one inch square. Due to the unexpected problem of the ACTS in orbit (Weisskopf et a1.
2002), we introduced a continuous function of the Charge injection so that we could recover the
radiation damage on the CCD. This technique (Prigozhin et a1. 2008) is added to the X18 in
orbit and improves the performance of the CCD (Uehiyaina et a1. 2009). Then, the MAXI was
successfully launched in July, 2009 by the space shuttle, Endeavor, and was installed to the
J apanese Experiment Module — Exposed Facility (J EM—EF) on the International Space Station
(188).

We report here the basic structure, calibration and in orbit performance of the SSC.
2. SSC Structure and its thermal performance in orbit

The SSC is installed on the GSC that is described in detail (Matsuoka et a1. 2009).
There are two cameras: SSC—H and SSC—Z. Each has 16 CCD Chips and is identical to each
other with the exception that the SSC—H is watching +200 above the horizontal direction of
the ISS and the SSC—Z is watching the zenith direction of the 188. We aligned 16 CCD Chips
in 2><8 array.
2.]. CCD for the MAXI/SSC

We have developed the CCD for X—ray detection (Tsuneini et a1. 2007) under the collab—
oration with the Hamamatsu Photonics KK. Table 1 shows the structural parameters of the
CCD (Katayaina et a1. 2005). Since there is no storage area, it works in a full frame mode. The
X—ray entrance surface has an A1 coat to prevent Visible light from entering. The A1 coat on

it possible to eliminate vacuum tight body. The CCD has a thick depletion layer by using a
high resistivity wafer. Based on the design parameters and the ground calibration (Tomida et
a1. 2010), we calculated the quantum efﬁciency (QE) that is shown in the literature (Matsuoka
et a1. 2009). In the next section, we will improve the accuracy of the QE calibrated in orbit
by using the Crab nebula.

2.2. T hermal performance in Orbit

The use of CCDs for X—ray detection requires a low working temperature. The cooling
system of the MAXI/SSC consists of two parts: one is a peltier device and the other is a
radiator with a loop heat pipe (LHP).

The hot side of the peltier is thermally connected to the body of the SSC. The body of
the SSC is cooled down around —200C that depends on the thermal condition of the radiator.
The radiator consists of two panels: an upper panel (Radiator Z : 0.527m2) and a forward
panel (Radiator H : 0.357m2). They are designed such that we can obtain the maximum area
within the allocated volume of the MAXI. Since these two panels are not in the same plane,
the LHP is designed to cool down the body of the SSC as much as we can. After launch, the
LHP started properly and is working as we expected. The radiator temperature depends on
the ISS location and its orientation, but there has been no decrease of cooling power as of the
writing phase of this paper.

There are two means of temperature control. One is to keep the CCD temperature
constant while the other is to keep peltier current constant. Since we select the latter mean
in the present operation of the SSC, the temperature of the CCD Changes as the radiator
temperature Changes. Figure 1 shows the temperature history of the CCD after the launch
where each point represents the one—day averaged temperature. Two panels of the radiator
show different thermal behavior whose temperature is between —250C and —550C. The LHP
cools down the SSC body around —200C. The peltier device cools down the CCD around
—600C. Since the peltier is running at constant current mode, the temperature difference is
also constant around 450C depending on the individual peltier device. The detailed spectral

analysis takes into account the working condition of the SSC.
3. Onboard Data Process

The data handling scheme of the MAXI/SSC is similar to that of the previous satellites.
The detailed explanation is given in the literature (Tomida et al. 2010). There is one Video
Chain for each camera (16 CCDs). MAXI is designed to observe not in a pointing mode but in
a scanning mode. We have two data—taking modes: one is the full frame mode and the other
is the parallel sum mode. The full frame mode is to obtain the image of 1024x1024 pixels for
each GOD. The full frame mode is only used to Check the performance of the CCD since the
time resolution is so bad due to the telemetry capacity.

The parallel sum mode is to add up many pixel signals to speed up the read out time.
In the standard observation of the MAXI/SSC, we add 64 rows as on—ohip sum while other
binning is possible by command. As we employ a Charge injection at every 64 rows, we skip
the Charge injected row and accumulate 63 rows for binning. In this way, we obtain 16><1024
pixels for each CCD. Since we sequentially read 16 CCD Chips, the read—out time is 5.865 s that
depends on the number of rows of the on—ohip sum. We should note that each CCD will have an
integration time of 5.498 s followed by a read—out time of 0.367s since one read—out Video Chain
reads 16 CCDs one by one. This makes us possible to partly determine the incident position of
the X—ray photon within the CCD. In this way, we can measure the CTI of the CCD even in
the parallel sum mode.

We employ event recognition method similar to the ASCA grade. In the parallel sum
mode, the Charge spread of the signal is effectively valid only for GO (single event), G1 (left
split event), G2 (right split event) and G3 (three—pixel event). Since we do not see the Charge
spread in the vertical direction, the background rejection efﬁciency is worse than that of the

pixels which is used for diagnostics. In the normal observation mode, parallel sum mode (64 binning) is
employed.
normal mode in other satellites. We expect that the X—ray events form G0, G1 or G2 while the
Charged particle event forms G3.

Figure 2 shows typical frame images Obtained in orbit. The night time image shows
X—ray events and particle events as well as some ﬁxed patterns due to the CCD Operation.
The day time image shows overﬂow in the edge area of the CCD. During the day time, direct
Sun lights enter through the slit and scattered inside the collimator even if the Sun does not
illuminate 0n the CCD. In the central part Of the CCD, the Sun light is well blocked by the
A1 coat. Because the edge of the Si wafer 0f the GOD is left un—Ceated, Sun light penetrates
into the CCD. Since the edge glow appears only in the day time Observation, we think that the
bright IR light enters the CCD through the edge of the CCD.

Looking at the night time image, we can handle the parallel sum mode data as other
satellites do. The day time image indicates that pixels on the edge of the CCD shew saturation
in the electronics. Therefore, only a central part Of the image can be analyzed. In the parallel
sum mode in 64—binning, the effective area reduces by 70%. Furthermore, the background is
quite different from that Of the night time image. We are still studying how to use the day time
image.

4. Calibration
4.]. Performance of the CCD in orbit

RadiO—aetive sources of 55Fe are installed at the edge of the cameras inside the
MAXI/SSC . We also Obtain continuous monitoring of Cu—K lines produced at the collima—
tor by the incident particles. Figure 3 shows the spectra for 32 CCDs each of which shows
Cu—K lines. By using these lines, we can continuously monitor the performance of the COD.

Fig. 3. Spectra for Cu—K lines for 32 CCDs. The effective energy ranges of some CCDs are limited below
9keV due to the electronics.
The intensity of Cu—K lines is about 0.08 counts s‘1 per CCD and that of Mn—K lines is about
0.05 counts s‘1 per CCD at the time of launch.

Figure 4 shows the history of the Cu—K peak position and its energy resolution (full
Width at half maximum: FWHM). Each point represents the data for one—day accumulation
time. The FWHM of Mn—Ka is 147 eV and that of Cu—Koz is 170 eV at the time of launch.
Mn—K is irradiated onto the far side from the read—out node of 4 CCDs While Cu—K is irradiated
uniformly over all the CCDs.

The 188 is in a Circular orbit of altitude around 350 km and inclination of 510.6. It
passes through the South Atlantic Anomaly (SAA) for 9—10 times a day. Furthermore, it passes
through high background region at high latitude. The background is monitored by the RBM
onboard the GSC (Sugizaki et al. 2010). It shows that 15% of the time is high background due
to SAA passage. Furthermore, it shows that the passage through high latitude also shows high
background. The background spectra for these two passages may be different Whereas they are
so high that the GSC turns off in observation.

The CCD employed has two Characteristics for radiation—hardness. One is a notch struc—
ture that conﬁnes the Charge transfer Channel to a very narrow Width. This improves a radiation—
hardness by a factor of three (Tsunemi et al. 2004). The other is a oharge—injeotion (CI) gate
through Which we can continuously inject some amount of Charge at every 64 rows in 64 binning
mode (Miyata et al. 2002). The CI method can partly compensate for degradation of the Charge

transfer inefﬁciency (CTI) 0f the CCD (Temida et a1. 1997). We can conﬁrm the validity of the
C1 by stepping the Operation of the CI. As Of the writing phase of this paper (8 months after
launch), we found that the decay of the Cu—K line of about 1 % /year without CI while that it
improves to be less than 0.2 % /year with C1. The decay of the FWHM at 6keV is estimated
to be 60 eV/year. This value is more than we expected before launch (Miyata et a1. 2002).

The Suzaku XIS employs CI in orbit (Prigezhin et a1. 2008). CI of the X18 (F1) improved
the decay of the 6 keV line from 1.6% /year to 0.4% /year. It also improves the decay of FWHM
at 6keV from 60 eV/year to 20 eV/year. Therefore, the performance of the CI 0n the X18 is
better than that Of the SSC. There are two differences between the X18 and the SSC. One is
the working temperature. The XIS is working at —900C while the SSC is working at —600C.
The other is the background condition. The high background passage time is 55% for the
MAXI/SSC while that is 10% for Suzaku. Although the effect of the background passage
depends on the spectrum and its intensity, the difference between Suzaku and MAXI/SSC is
due to the difference in orbit, mainly in inclination angle.

4.2. Background of the 350 in orbit

The background condition is carefully monitored by the REM and the GSC 0n MAXI
since inclination of the ISS orbit is 510.6 resulting to pass at higher latitude regions than
other X—ray missions. We switch Off the bias level to the CCD during the passage of the SAA
(Miyata et a1. 2003). However, we switch on during the passage of high latitude regions where
the background is too high to Obtain good data.

Figure 5 shows the frame image Obtained near the high background region (W108O.6,
N490.4, eut—Off—rigidity (COR) : 1.0 GeV/C) at the same exposure time at 8:34, April 21, 2010.
We Clearly see many particle events on both the SSC—H and the SSC—Z. The SSC—H image
shows many Circular extended events that are generated by particles entering into the COD

along the normal to the CCD surface. The SSC—Z image shows events of long trajectories
that run within the depletion layer. The number of particle events on the SSC—H image is
about 10 times more than that of the SSC—Z. This indicates that the eross—seetion against the
particle ﬂux is much bigger in SSC—H than that in SSC—Z. Taking into account the fact that the
direction of the geomagnetic ﬁeld is 7 4O downward from the horizon, the normal of the SSC—Z
is almost parallel to the geomagnetic ﬁeld line while that Of the SSC—H is almost perpendicular
to it. Since the high background comes from the trapped Charged particles by the geomagnetic
ﬁeld, their moving direction is almost in the horizontal direction. Therefore, they leave events
of long trajectories with less ﬂux in the SSC—Z while they leave Circular extended events with
more ﬂux in the SSC—H.

We have accumulated data during times when the background level is low. All the events
are sorted according to the grade; G0, G1, G2 and G3. G3 is thought to be generated from
particle events. Figure 6 shows the spectra for G0 and G1—l—G2.

The G0 spectrum shows two components dividing at 0.6 keV. The Gl—l— G2 spectrum
has three components dividing at 1.3 keV and 0.7 keV. We found that the G1 spectrum below

0.6keV is produced by particles having long trajectory 0n the GOD. The very end of the
trajectories sometimes leave GO events. If they leave adjacent two pixels, they will form G1 or
G2 events that extend the spectrum of G1 and G2 up to 1.3 keV. If they leave more than three
pixels, they will be treated as particle background. The peaks around 0.7keV 0n the G1+G2
spectra come from the event threshold (0.4keV). In this way, we ﬁnd that the parallel sum
mode on the MAXI/SSC generates high background at low energy depending on the grade.

Figure 7 shows the background spectra of GO+G1+G2. We Clearly see the anti—
eerrelatien between the intensity and the COR. Furthermore, the spectral shape is almost
constant. Therefore, we have to sort the data by the COR. Since we Observe the sky in a scan—
ning mode, it is relatively easy to estimate the background for point sources. However, it is
difﬁcult to estimate the background for extended structures. The precise analysis for extended
sources require us to study the background behavior as a function of the COR.

Hiraga et a1. (2001) measured the Charge spread in the CCD as a function of mean
absorption length in Si. Then, we can calculate the branching ratio for X—ray events. For
example, the Al—K X—rays generate 92% for GO and others for G1 and G2 that is conﬁrmed by
the ground calibration. From ﬁgure 6, we see that the fraction of G1 and G2 increases as a
function of energy, particularly above 5 keV. This indicates that the Charge spread increases as
a function of energy. Taking into account the background condition, we use only GO events for
the energy range below the Si—K edge and GO+G1+G2 events for the energy range above it.
4.3. Calibration of the quantum eﬁcz’ency

We accumulated data for the Crab nebula, shown in ﬁgure 8. When we ﬁt the data by
a power—law with interstellar absorption feature, NH, and the quantum efﬁciency (QE) 0f the
pre—launeh data (Matsueka et a1. 2009), we Obtained the power law index y of 2.2 and NH 0f
6X102lem_2. These are different values from those obtained in the previous literature (Kirsch
et a1. 2005). With taking into account the energy range of the SSC, we ﬁnd the parameters
for the Crab nebula as y is 2.1 Of NH 0f 3.8X10210m_2. This indicates that we need further
calibration.

Since the CCD Chip is the coldest part in the MAXI, we may have contamination on it. The
difference may come from the possible contamination that will be Checked in future calibration.
The Spectrum Obtained is the integration of all the data. The MAXI/SSC detected the
Crab nebula with various acquisition angle (00 N 400). The best ﬁt parameters are converted

the QE taking into account the acquisition angle. Figure 9 ShOWS the revised QE fer the

5. Scan Observation

MAXI/SSC observes the sky with an FOV of 10.5 x 900 in each camera. The angular
response along the scanning direction is set by the collimator, resulting in a trianglar shape.
The perpendicular direction is limited by the slit. Since the position resolution is limited by
the CCD pixel size, it shows a box—oar shape. The FOV moves with the ISS rotation around
the Earth. Therefore, the on—souroe time is about 45 s. Figure 10 shows the distribution of
photons on the sky when the Soo X—l and the Crab nebula pass the FOV. The ﬁgure for the
Soo X—l comes from a single scan. The source is generally detected by two CCD Chips out of 16
Chips. Therefore, the data are taken two times in one read—out oyole (5.865 s). We see several
line segments that are separated by about 2.9 s.

The ﬁgure for the Crab nebula comes from the data of one—day integration where we also
see a recurrent nova of A0535+26 (Sugizaki et a1. 2009). We see that the Crab nebula gives
us 80 oounts/soan. The SSC can detect 1300 photons/day from the Crab nebula if it is in the
acquisition angle of 00. The background level of the SSC is about 150 photons/day/PSF. We
ﬁnd that the Crab nebula is detected at the 1000 conﬁdence level in one—day integration data.
Therefore, the detection limit of the SSC is about 50mCrab (50) for a one—day observation. It
becomes about ZOOmCrab for single scans.

The CCD Chip of the SSC can detect about 200 photons om‘2 (read—out time)‘1 if we set
the pile up events to be less than 10%. In the normal operation mode, this value corresponds to
80 photons om‘2 s‘1 that is 25 Crab nebula intensity. Therefore, we can expect that the source
like the Soo X—l is almost pile—up free even at the center of the FOV.

Fig. 10. Singe scan image of the See X—1 (left) and one—day integration data of the Crab nebula (right).
Since the read—out time is 5.865 s, the data along the scan direction is quantized in the left ﬁgure.

6. All Sky Map
The SSC Observes the sky all the time. Only at the passage of the SAA and at the time
when the Sun is very Close to the FOV, we switch Off the bias voltage applied to the GOD.
The data are subject to the edge glow problem during day time observation. Therefore, the
effective observation efﬁciency is expected to be about 30%. In the ﬁrst 6 months after the
launch, we had occasional problems in one Of the two data transfer systems. When we had a
problem, we had to turn the MAXI Off to recover. This reduced the data taking efﬁciency down
to 20% or less. The problem was ﬁnally ﬁxed by adding an extra router by an astronaut that
was transported with the space shuttle in February, 2010.
In this way, we accumulated the data and obtained the all sky map by using 7 months
data shown in ﬁgure 11. The red, green and blue on the map correspond to the energy range
12

"
"13","of 0.6—1.0keV, 1.0—3.0keV and 3.0—8.0keV, respectively. This map is exposure—tiine corrected.
It should be compared with that obtained by the GSC (Mihara et al. 2010).

Since the PSF of the SSC is similar to that of the GSC, the image in ﬁgure 11 is similar
to that of the GSC, however, the SSC is sensitive to the energy range below 2 keV that can not
be reached by the GSC. The brightest sources below 2 keV are the Cygnus Loop and the Vela
SNR. The Vela SNR is also seen its extent about 70 in diameter.

In the all sky Inap, we notice an extended structure, particularly extended in the northern
hemisphere. There are two problems in the SSC observation. One is that the observation
efﬁciency is about 30% due to the edge glow effect and the passage of high background regions.
The other is the observation mode of the MAXI. The MAXI is observing the sky all the time.
We have no Chance to see the dark Earth from which we can estimate the non—X—ray background.
We have the possibility that the 188 is up—side down when the space shuttle is approaching to
dock. So far, we have insufﬁcient observation time of the dark Earth which makes us difﬁcult
to detect emissions from extended sources. Further observation and study are needed to obtain
an extended emission analysis extraction that will be reported elsewhere.

7. Conclusion

MAXI was launched in July, 2009 and installed on the ISS. Observation started from
August, 2010. The CCD on the SSC is cooled down to the working temperature around —600C
by the combination of the peltier cooler, LHP and radiator. The GOD is working either in
a frame mode or in a parallel suin Inode (64—binning). The frame mode is employed in the
diagnostic mode. The parallel suin mode is employed in the standard observation mode. The
detection limit (50 level) of the SSC is 200 InCrab for one scan and 50 InCrab for one—day
integration.

The frame Inode shows the performance of the CCD. In the night time, the CCD func—
tions properly while it suffers an edge glow when the Sun is near the FOV. The observation
efﬁciency of the SSC is about 30%. The performance of the GOD is continuously monitored
both by the Mn—K X—rays and by the Cu—K X—rays. ln Mn—K X—rays, the energy resolution
of the GOD is 147 eV (FWHM) at the time of launch. The radiation damage decreases the
performance of the CCD. Since we employ a Charge injection method, the degradation of the
CCD reduces to some extent. The gain of the CCD stays almost constant while we measured
the gain decrease to be 0.9% /year without CI. The FWHM decreases about 60 eV/year. The
recovery by the CI of the SSC is not so effective to that of the X18 on Suzaku. Both satellites
are in low Earth orbit with different inolination angle. The SSC passes high background region
at high latitude that the X18 does not reach. Therefore, the difference in the Cl may be due
to the particle background condition.

The SSC observes the all sky by using the X—ray CCDs for the ﬁrst time. There are
many sources detected not only point sources but extended sources. Due to the lack of effective

extraction process.
