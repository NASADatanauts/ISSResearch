Abstract
This study is part of a Materials International Space Station Experiment (MISSE) sequence to characterize the
performance of prospective spacecraft materials when subjected to the synergistic effects of the space environment.
Atomic oxygen (A0) is the most prevalent species in low earth orbit (LEO). In this environment A0 is mainly
responsible for the erosion of hydrocarbons and halocarbon polymers. The A0 erosion rates of Kapton (DuPont) H are
known and well documented. Hence, it is customary to compare the AO erosion yields of candidate materials to the
commonly accepted standard of this polyimide. The purpose of this study was to provide characterization of AO

microscopic defects in the protective ﬁlm, and compare the degradation resulting from hyperthermal ram (~4.5 eV)

LEO test allocations such as MISSE 2 are limited,
thus it is highly desirable to develop a correlation
between the in-space AO erosion characteristics of
materials and ground-based AO erosion characteristics
to be able to predict in-space behavior based on ground
laboratory test results. Although it is most convenient
to use isotropic thermal energy RF plasma ashers to
assess AO durability, the results can be misleading in
part because the relative erosion rates at thermal
energies (~0.04 eV) differ from LEO ram AO energies

each ﬂight sample.

To place the sample mass loss on an equivalent
basis, mass loss comparison was based on the erosion
area available to an in-space sample. This meant an
adjustment was needed for the mass loss from asher
exposure since, in this case, all surfaces of a sample
could contribute to the mass loss. To make this
adjustment, an auxiliary plasma—asher experiment was
conducted to determine the fractional mass losses
attributable to the following sample surfaces: (1) the
fully exposed upper side, (2) the lower side facing the
glass plate, and (3) to the unprotected periphery. The
fractional mass losses for the three given areas were
determined to be approximately 0.31, 0.68, and 0.006,

together by the substrate. Many of these sites may hold
up under “directed beam” exposure as in the case of
hyperthermal AD, but such a loose protective umbrella
may not withstand exposure to isotropic AO. Perhaps
small to moderate levels of AO exposure cause
microscopic tears to occur enhancing the undercutting
process. This would explain the increased mass loss
rate for the pre-eXposed case. Another possible
explanation for the difference in rates is if, for the pre-
eXposed case, thermal accommodation of hypertherrnal A C
A0 is moderated sufﬁciently due to advantageous
cavity wall composition, then increased erosion
through effective trapping of persistently energetic AO
could occur. Conjectures such as the above are often
best examined using computational simulations, which
allow parameters such as extinction coefﬁcients to be
assigned separately for individual components, such as
for the SiOX and polymer cavity surfaces.

13. ABSTRACT (Maximum 200 words)
This study is part Of 8 Materials International Space Station Experiment (MISSE) sequence to characterize the performance
of prospective spacecraft materials When subj ected t0 the synergistic effects of the space environment. Atomic oxygen (A0)
is the most prevalent species in low earth orbit (LEO). In this environment A0 is mainly responsible for the erosion of
hydrocarbons and haloearbon polymers. The A0 erosion rates of Kapton (DuPont) H are known and well documented.
Hence, it is customary to compare the AO erosion yields of candidate materials to the commonly accepted standard of this
polyimide. The purpose of this study was to provide characterization OfAO degradation of SiOX protected Kapton H ﬁlm,
Which was subj ect during MISSE 2 t0 undercutting erosion beneath microscopic defects in the protective ﬁlm, and compare
the degradation resulting from hyperthermal ram (~45 eV) LEO A0 to the degradation resulting from exposure to thermal
ground-based (~0.04 eV) A0.
