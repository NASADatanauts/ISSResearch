Abstract

MicrograVity, hypergraVity, Vibration, ionizing radiation and temperature ﬂuctuations are maj or factors
of outer space ﬂight affecting human organs and tissues. There are several reports on the effect
of space ﬂight on different human cell types of mesenchymal origin while information regarding
Changes to vascular endothelial cells is scarce.

Ultrastructural and cytophysiological features of macrovascular endothelial cells in outer space
ﬂight and their persistence during subsequent culturing were demonstrated in the present investigation.
At the end of the space ﬂight, endothelial cells displayed profound Changes indicating cytoskeletal
lesions and increased cell membrane permeability. Readapted cells of subsequent passages
exhibited persisting cytoskeletal Changes, decreased metabolism and cell growth indicating cellular
senescence.
