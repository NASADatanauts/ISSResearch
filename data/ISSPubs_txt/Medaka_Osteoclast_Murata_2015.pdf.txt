upregulated in more than four of the tissues examined, thus suggesting common immuno-
regulatory and stress responses during space adaptation.

Introduction

Space radiation and microgravity are major environmental stressors to humans in space, and
the physiological Changes induced by those stressors are the main health concerns during space
adaptation [1]. HOW microgravity modiﬁes radiation effects is an important question that must
inﬂuence our understanding of the hazards encountered by astronauts during prolonged space
travel.

To understand how organisms adapt to the space environment, many experiments can be
conducted on humans While they work aboard the Space Shuttle or the International Space Sta-
tion (188) [2, 3]. However, various kinds of animal experiments relevant to human physiology
are needed to help prevent or solve the health problems astronauts might face. The effects of
spaceﬂight and simulated microgravity on various tissues and systems of the human body have
been well documented using animal models for the skeletal system [4—6], brain [7, 8], immune
system [9—13], ovary [14], and testis [15, 16]. Several transcriptomic analyses after spaceﬂight
have also been conducted, suggesting that there could be decreases in the expression levels of
genes involved in oxidative stress, and in the levels of key proteins involved in mitochondrial
fatty acid metabolism [17]. In contrast, the expression levels of genes encoding proteins
involved in various cellular defense mechanisms including antioxidation showed increases
[18—22]. However, most of these studies concerned alterations in gene expression levels after
two weeks of adaptation or less, and n0 inducing factors could be identified.

In addition to mammals, lower vertebrate such as amphibians have thus far been used for
space experiments as model animals. In particular, as the female newt can lay eggs a few
months after natural breeding With sperm in the Cloacal pelvic glands, the impact of using newt
in the space environment on morphogenesis has been veriﬁed [23]. Regarding the immune sys-
tem, genes related to the immune system in mammalians are conserved in amphibians, and a
reduction of IgM amounts and alteration of its configuration in the space environment have
been reported, suggesting that the immune system may be affected in the space environment
[13, 24].

Japanese medaka is a vertebrate ﬁsh species commonly used for scientiﬁc research because
they are smaller than zebraﬁsh, can live in a much smaller area, and consume less food, water,
and oxygen [25]. It is a suitable model fish for studying space adaptation, as evidenced by adult
fish having mated successfully during 15 days of ﬂight in space in the second International
Microgravity Laboratory (IML-2) mission in 1994. The eggs laid by the ﬁsh developed nor-
mally, and hatched as fry (juveniles) in space [26]. Unlike terrestrial animals including mam-
malian species that require relatively large volumes of blood (ca. 10% of body mass) at high
arterial pressure (ca. 100 mmHg) under normal gravity, teleost ﬁsh circulate a small volume of
blood (3—4% of body mass) at low blood pressure (20—30 mmHg) in the relatively gravity free
aquatic environment [27]. Therefore, ﬁsh can be used as the experimental counterparts of
mouse or rat models to understand space adaptation mechanisms as ﬁsh are less dependent on
gravity [28].

In 2012, another space experiment on the effect of microgravity 0n osteoclasts and analysis
of the gravity-sensing system in Japanese medaka (“Medaka Osteoclast”) were conducted
(httpz/ /Www.nasa.g0V/ mission_pages/ station/ research/ experiments/ 984.htm1). In the present
study, male and female fish (six-weeks old at launch) were cultured in the Aquatic Habitat

(AQH) system [17] for two months in the ISS. SiX ﬁsh were ﬁxed with 4% paraformaldehyde
(PFA) or kept in RNA stabilization reagent (n = 4) and dissected for tissue sampling after
being returned to the ground, so that several principal investigators (PIs) working on this proj-
ect could share samples. Here we report on histological and transcriptomic analyses using siX
isolated tissues (brain, eye, ovary, testis, liver, and intestine) after 56—60 days of exposure to the
space environment.

Materials and Methods

Experimental Design and Animal Care

The protocol utilized in the study was authorized by the Committee on Animal Care and Use
at the Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency (No. 011—014A) and by the American Association
or Laboratory Animal Science at the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NAS-
12—003-Y1). The experimental procedures were conducted in accordance with the guidelines
for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals of the University of Tokyo and Tokyo Institute of
Technology.

The spaceﬂight experiments were conducted using the F 1 ﬁsh of two closed colonies; Japa-
nese medaka wild type Cab and Cab strain transgenic ﬁsh (TRAPzGFP, OsterixzDsRed), which
were originally kept in the ﬁsh facility at the Tokyo Institute of Technology [29, 30]. At this
age, the seX of immature ﬁsh cannot be determined. The F 1 ﬁsh (16 mm in length, siX-weeks
old at launch, and n = 8 in each of two aquaria) were transferred from the “Fish Carrier” to the
two aquaria of the AQH, which is installed in a small powered multipurpose payload rack and
housed in the Japanese Experiment Module (Kibo) on the 188 [17]. These transgenic ﬁsh were
cultured as the spaceﬂight group (SF) in the AQH from October 26 to December 24, 2012, and
utilized for the “Medaka Osteoclast” space experiment. Three out of eight fish in each aquar-
ium were removed 14 days after incubation for “Medaka Osteoclast.” The other fish were
maintained in the AQH system for two months in the 188. This habitat provides automatic
feeding for the ﬁsh, an air—water interface, temperature control, and a specimen sampling
mechanism, and enables the monitoring of behaVior 24 hours a day [31]. There are two cham-
bers for habitation, each holding about 700 m1 of water. Light-emitting diodes were used to
simulate 14-h day and 10-h night cycles. The animals and tissues we used in this study were
shared with the “Medaka Osteoclast” experiment.

Sample Preparation

In this study, no abnormalities in swimming and feeding behaVior were observed in the SF
group or GC group, and we used all the samples following the experiment. Sample ﬁxations
were performed between 8:20—14:00 without feeding in the morning on the sampling day. SiX
fish were sampled for histological analysis at 56 days of ﬂight in the ISS, and four were used for
RNA-seq analysis at 60 days. Fish were transferred using the “Fish Catcher” (a special large
pipette used to remove fish from each aquarium for transfer to the “Fish Fixation Apparatus,”
which is a chemical ﬁxation kit constructed from triple-layered plastic bags, with 6 m1 of breed-
ing water for histology and 5 ml for RNA-seq analysis of each fish. For histology, three ﬁsh
were transferred to this bag with approx. 18 m1 of breeding water. The ﬁsh were treated with
approx. 0.018% of anesthetic M8222 (tricaine methanesulfonate) solution by mixing 4 m1 of 1
g/ L MS222 to 18 m1 of breeding water. Then the whole bodies of ﬁsh were ﬁxed in approx. 4%
paraformaldehyde in 0.1 M cacodylate acid buffer (pH 7.4) solution by mixing 20 m1 of 8.6%
paraformaldehyde in 0.215 M cacodylate acid buffer solution to 22 m1 of 0.018% anesthetic
solution, and kept at 2°C. After three or four days of fixation, fixative was replaced by 0.1 M
cacodylate acid buffer solution (pH 7.4) and kept at 2°C for later analysis.

ZQ ' PLOS | O N E Transcriptomic Analysis of Fish Tissues after 2 Months Stay in Space
For the RNA-seq analysis, four ﬁsh were used and two each were stacked into a bag with
320 mg/ L of anesthetic M8222 by breaking the pouch containing 5 m1 of 700 mg/L M8222 and
mixing the solution. Then anesthetics were removed by sponge absorption, replaced by the
RNA stabilization reagent RNAlater® (Thermo Fisher Scientiﬁc Inc., Waltham, MA, USA),

and kept at —95°C.

After the spaceﬂight experiment, a group of ﬁsh of the same strain and age were housed in
an AQH for two months at Tsukuba Space Center in Ibaraki, Japan as the ground control (GC)
group. As space experiments were conducted under several limited conditions, it was necessary
to perform ground control after the space experiment, in order to follow the same conditions
as those used in the space experiment. GC samples were treated the same way as for the SF
group, with PFA ﬁxation and RNA storage being conducted at an interval of four days (56 and
60 days after breeding). The SF and GC experiments were only conducted once. All samples
were used for the subsequent experiments. Fixed samples in RNAlater®, which became hard,
were carefully dissected on a 90-mm dish (As One, GD 90—15) using noyes spring scissors
(Nisshin Em Co., Ltd. Tokyo, 5 m/m), forceps (Dumont 5-Inox-H), and ring forceps (Napox
A-26) under a microscope. The brain and eyes were separated from the head region, and the
liver, intestine, testis, and ovary were separated by an abdominal operation. Fixed samples
from all six siblings were used for tissue sharing with other PIs.

H istology
Whole body ﬁxation with PFA was performed in the GC and SF groups described above, and
the samples used for conventional histology were placed in Davidson’s fixative (22 m1 of 37—
40% formaldehyde, 33 m1 ethanol, 11.5 ml glacial acetic acid, and 33.5 ml distilled H20 in 100
m1 Davidson’s ﬁxative) after dissecting out the intestine. The ovary, testis, liver, and intestine
were used in this study. The intestine was separated into four portions longitudinally. Epithelia
were not ﬁxed well except for the most caudal part of the intestine in both the SF and GC
groups as compared with conventional Davidson’s ﬁxation after dissection (Fig 1 and Support-
ing Information 81 Fig). Testicular type A spermatogonia was not ﬁxed well and shrank after
ﬁxation in both the SF and GC groups, as compared with conventional Davidson’s ﬁxation
(Fig 1 and 82 Fig). Samples were dehydrated through an ethanol series and then embedded in
Technovit resin (ovary, testis, and intestine) or parafﬁn wax (liver). Sections 7-mm thick were
then stained with hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) to analyze morphological alteration [32].
RNA-Seq
To compare the gene expression pattern between SF and GC, ﬁxed samples were dissected
under a microscope and total RNA was isolated from 2—4 siblings using TRIzol® reagent
(Thermo Fisher Scientiﬁc Inc.) from the brain, eye, liver, intestine, testis, and ovary. The intes-
tine was separated into four portions longitudinally and high quality RNA could only be
obtained from most caudal part of the intestine. RNA quality was evaluated using an Agilent
Bioanalyzer 2100 total RNA Nano series 11 chip (Agilent Technologies Inc., Santa Clara, CA,
USA) and total RNA was pooled from the same tissue as a single sample in this study. The RIN
numbers of the testis, ovary, liver, brain, eye, and intestine in the SF samples were 7.1, 7.3, 7.9,
8.1, 8.6, and 7.1, respectively. The RIN numbers of the testis, ovary, liver, brain, eye, and intes-
tine in the GC samples were 7.5, 7.7, 8.0, 7.8, 8.1, and 8.7, respectively. RNA-seq analysis was
conducted commercially by the Takara de novo RNA-seq service (Takara Bio Inc., Shiga,
Japan). Transcriptome libraries were prepared from total RNA using Illumina TruSeq Stranded
RNA Sample Preparation kits (Illumina Inc., San Diego, CA, USA). Libraries were sequenced
by a single read length of 100 nucleotides on the Illumina Hi-Seq2500 instrument as per the

manufacturer’s recommendations. The resulting reads were trimmed of low quality nucleotides
and aligned against 24662 CDNA sequences predicted by Ensembl’s Oryzias latipes Genebuild
(version 56, www.ensembl.0rg). Gene expression levels were determined by measuring the sum
of the reads per kilobase per million mapped read (RPKM) values of each eX0n. Alignment
counts were normalized for transcript lengths and total aligned RPKM values. To acquire more
accurate results, we filtered out the data for samples when the estimated RPKM values in the
SF 0r GC sample were < 1.0 or when the read numbers were < 5. Table 1 summarizes the
numbers of genes examined in each tissue. Fisher’s exact test was conducted to compare the
expression ratio between the intestine and the other tissues. The mRNA-Seq data from our
experiments have been submitted to the DNA Data Bank of Japan (DDBI) (http://www.ddbj.
nig.ac.jp/) under accession no. DRA003542.
The gene expression ratio between the SF and GC tissues was deﬁned as Space Responsive-
ness (SR):
SR 2 10g2(RPKMSF5 /RPKMGC5)
To compare gene responsiveness to the space environment among tissues, we selected 5,345
genes showing a minimum expression level as RPKM Z 1 and a number of unique reads with
RPKM Z 5 in all siX tissues.

Gene Ontology (GO) Analysis
All eX0ns from the transcript GO identity numbers (IDs) of a gene ID were integrated, and the
integrated eX0ns were identiﬁed as gene positions of the gene ID. When eX0n lengths differed
between transcript IDs for the same gene ID, the longer eX0n was selected. All sequenced reads
mapped to the region of integrated eX0ns used Bowtie (version 0.12.9) for calculating gene
expression levels [33]. The G0 IDs used in this analysis were obtained using the following
steps. First, human Ensembl gene IDs that were orthologues for the Japanese medaka Ensembl
gene IDs were obtained from the dataset of Oryzias latipes genes of the Hd-rR strain using Bio-
Mart 0f the Ensembl database (http://www.ensembl.0rg/indeX.html). Next, Entrez gene IDs
associated with human Ensembl gene IDs were extracted from gene2ensembl (ftp://ftp.ncbi.
n1m.nih.g0V/ gene/DATA/ gene2ensembl.gz) in the NCBI database (httpz/ /www.ncbi.n1m.nih.

The G0 IDs associated with the Entrez gene IDs were ﬁnally extracted from gene2go (ftp://
ftp.ncbi.n1m.nih.gov/gene/DATA/geneZgo.gz) in the NCBI database. The G0 IDs were counted
and organized using customized Perl scripts. For the GO IDs of each of the gene groups classiﬁed
by gene expression levels, hypergeometric distribution analysis was conducted using R software
(version 3.1.2, http://cran.r—project.org/doc/manuals/r-patched/R—adminhtml). The threshold of
p-values in the analysis was set at 0.05. False discovery rates were calculated using the Benja-
mini—Hochberg method [34], and the threshold in the analysis was set at 0.05.

Hierarchal cluster analysis was conducted with tree clustering using Cluster 3.0, an
enhanced version of Cluster originally developed by Michael Eisen at Stanford University
(http://bonsai.hgc.jp/~mdehoon/software/Cluster/manual/indexhtml), and TreeView pro-
grams, which allow interactive graphical analysis of the results from Cluster 3.0 (http://
jtreeView.sourceforge.net/).

Resuﬂs
Histology showed slight disruption in oogenesis after two months of
spaceflight.
To find morphological alteration in tissues after two month in the space environment, we ana-
lyzed the parafﬁn embedded sections of several tissues. Tissue structures were no different
between the SF (n = 4) and GC (n = 5) groups in the caudal part of the intestine (Fig 1). Using
H&E staining of the liver, cellular abnormalities such as vacuolization, ﬁbrosis, the appearance
of spindle-like cells with pyknotic nuclei, and malignant transformation were not observed in
either group (n = 5 each). In the ovary, we found the depletion of previtellogenic stage oocytes
in all SF samples (n = 3), but not in the GC samples (n = 2) (Fig 1 and S3 Fig). This suggested
that oogenesis was slightly disrupted, even though body growth and maturation were not
delayed, and mating behaVior occurred in the space environment every day from the 27th day
after launch—timing similar to that in the GC group (Chatani et a1., submitted elsewhere).
However, the ﬁxation conditions were obviously different in the space environment, which
lacked circulation as compared with the ground controls. In the testis, although cysts of type A
spermatogonia were not well fixed and could not be identiﬁed, other structures such as Gb
cysts, spermatocytes, spermatids, and spermatozoa were similar between the GC (n = 3) and SF
(n = 2) groups, suggesting that normal spermatogenesis was maintained during spaceﬂight.
Transcriptomic analysis reveals the highest level of spaceflight-induced
changes in the intestine.
Next, RNA-seq analysis was conducted to ﬁnd alteration in the gene expression during two months
of spaceﬂight. S4 Fig shows the distribution of the number of genes responsive to SFs among differ-
ent tissues. Table 1 summarizes the numbers of genes showing more than a twofold difference in
expression level in the SF tissues. The numbers of responsive genes were clearly tissue-dependent
(81—812 Tables). A few genes in the brain and eyes responded to the space environment. On the
other hand, more than 2,500 genes changed their expression levels in the caudal part of the intestine,
suggesting that this was the most responsive tissue (SS and S6 Tables). Moreover, many genes were
downregulated in the liver without accompanying histological abnormalities (S7 and S8 Tables).
GO analysis presents different gene expression patterns among tissues
in the space environment.
Spaceﬂight-induced transcriptome alterations (with more than two-fold differences) in various
GO categories were detected in the brain, eye and intestine (Tables 2—4). Gene expression was

ovary suggested that the growth of oocytes was disturbed, several genes related to oogenesis
were extracted from the database. The expression levels of zona pellucida glycoprotein genes

Oxidative stress related genes were upregulated specifically in the
intestine during spaceflight.
The top 400 genes ranked by ||TSR|| were analyzed using Cluster version 3.0 (Fig 2). Most of
the genes showed high tissue speciﬁcity. We identified ﬁve clusters based on tissue dependence
of the SR patterns, but no preferential distribution for specific GO categories was detected in
any clusters. Similar responsiveness was observed between the brain and eye, the ovary and tes-
tis, and the liver and intestine. Eleven genes including klf9, klf13, ode], hsp70.3 and hiflal,
which was annotated as hif3a in the human GO analysis, were upregulated in more than four
of the tissues examined, thus suggesting common immunoregulatory and stress responses in
multiple tissues during space adaptation for two months or less (Table 6). Moreover, among
the 47 intestine-specific genes with SFs upregulated or downregulated, 10 were categorized as
GO:0055114 (oxidation-reduction processes). There were seven upregulated genes (prdxl,
GSTOl, cyba, steap3, pgd, arf2, and TXNDCZ) and three downregulated genes (Scdb,
HSDl 1B1L, and CDOlL). This suggests that the caudal part of the intestine was highly sensi-
tive to oxidation-reduction stress in the space environment (Table 7).
Discussion
Here we conducted both histological and transcriptomic analyses using Japanese medaka fish
adapted to the space environment for two months, and performed sampling while still in the
188. The RNA-seq technique allows quantitative measurement of transcriptomes in a high-
throughput manner with a high dynamic range of quantitative measurement.
The tissue structures of the liver, ovary, and the most caudal part of the intestine were well
retained by chemical fixation in the ISS, and high quality RNA could only be obtained from

expression levels of Choriogenin precursor genes were suppressed only in the ovary. These
results suggest that oogenesis could be suppressed, such as in the quality of eggs after two
months in the space environment, unless there was no delay in mating behavior. In a mouse

model of spaceﬂight, the presence of developing mouse follicles of all stages, together with the
corpora lutea in all three treatment groups, two sets of control animals, and a single set of ﬂight
animals, indicated that no signiﬁcant gross morphological Changes occurred in ovarian tissues
when exposed for up to 13 days [14]. It is known that maturation of the medaka ovary begins
one week after hatching [35]. We analyzed ﬁsh that were launched at siX weeks of age and
found Changes in the ovary after two months. The gene expression was altered even though the
appearance of mating behaVior suggested that a very slight Change had occurred in two
months, and that the longer the duration in the space environment, such as being born in the
188, the more severe the phenotype may appear. Moreover, our results suggest that ﬁsh grown
in the space environment from this immature stage would show more severely affected pheno-
types relative to the numbers of oocytes and oogenesis. Several factors could account for alter-
ations in the medaka ovary after a two-month stay in the 188, such as prolonged exposure to
low-dose space radiation and endocrine Changes under microgravity.

The transcriptomic analysis showed large differences in space responsiveness among the tis-
sues, and that most of the Changes were highly tissue-dependent. Some stress-related GO gene
proﬁles were altered after space adaptation; speciﬁcally those encoding 14-3-3 protein binding
(GOz0071889) in the brain and eyes; those encoding antigen processing and presentation of
exogenous peptide antigens Via MHC Class I molecules (GOz0002479); those encoding apopto-
tic processes (GOz0006915); and DNA damage responses (GOz0006977) in the intestine were
all increased. In addition to the GO analysis, we also identiﬁed 11 upregulated genes and one
downregulated gene showing multi-tissue responses related to cell proliferation and oxygen-
related stress responses. The intestine proved more highly sensitive to the space environment
than the other tissues at the single gene expression level. Moreover, 10 genes in the category of
oxidation—reduction processes (GOz0055114) showed intestinal speciﬁc responses in the SF
group. Reductions in liver, spleen, and thymus masses were observed, and many of the genes
responsible for scavenging reactive oxygen species were upregulated in C57BL/6NTaC mice
after spaceﬂight during a 13-day Space Shuttle mission (STS-118) [36]. The effects of three-
month exposure to the space environment using the Mice Drawer System on the expression of
genes and proteins in the mouse brain were reported [8, 37]. The biological functions of the
upregulated genes were related to immune response, metabolic processes, and/ or inﬂammatory
response; the downregulated functions were related to catalytic and oxidoreductase enzyme
activities. The present study supported previous ﬁndings in that the genes involved in encoding
stress factors, such as immune and inﬂammatory responses, were upregulated or downregu-
lated in the space environment.

Moreover, throughout the evolution of the cellular immune system, members of the MHC
Class I superfamily have served as indicators of intracellular stress response [38]. Before adap-
tive immunity, Class I-like molecules likely reported the stress status of cells to primordial
migratory leukocytes. In the ER, chaperones guide the assembly of MHC Class 1 oc chain,
BZ-microglobulin, and peptides. Stress stimuli such as heat shock, hypoxia, Viral replication,
abnormal proteins, starvation or transformation ultimately lead to an accumulation of
unfolded or misfolded proteins in the lumen of the ER. The tissue-speciﬁc ER responses may
be activated through intracellular signal transduction pathways during space adaptation.
Although it is important to replicate the present experiment, these ﬁndings could be utilized as
markers of common space adaptations in vertebrates ranging from ﬁsh to humans. Moreover,
generating transgenic fish that express the candidate marker genes found in this study could be
a useful tool for evaluating the biological effects of the space environment.

There were no alterations in the expression level of genes involved in metabolism and diges-
tive enzymes, suggesting that the major processes involved in food intake or growth were not
altered in the space environment. Previous experiments showed that medaka could mate, and

that healthy embryos could hatch and mature after being returned to earth. Those results indi-
cated that this species is a useful model for understanding long-term adaptations to the space
environment [26]. The mating behavior that was also observed in this system conﬁrmed the
previous experiments (Chatani et al., unpublished results). It was also useful to compare
Changes in gene expression levels and tissue structures among individual ﬁsh under the same
culture conditions, as six adult ﬁsh could be maintained using the AQH system. This number
of animals increases the amount of acquirable data and enhances the statistical significance of
the experiments. Thus, it will be important to replicate these experiments.

In this study, the ﬁsh were kept over a single generation for two months using the AQH sys-
tem, in which the breeding of three generations of medaka in the ISS environment is possible
[17]. Such a three-generation culture enables the study of mechanisms for adapting to the
space environment by observing ﬁsh that have been born and raised in space. Moreover, by
conducting experiments using space-born ﬁsh in this culture system, it will be possible to verify
the maturation and maintenance of oocytes in the ovary. Future experimental designs should
take into account the overall intricacies of the female reproductive system and its inter-rela-
tionship with other physiological systems of the animal.

Epithelial structures, except for the most caudal part of the intestine and Ga cysts in the tes-
tis, were not ﬁxed well by whole body ﬁxation with PFA in both the SF and GC groups. David-
son’s ﬁxative is normally used for the medaka testis and intestine [32]. Conversely, the ﬁxation
of pharyngeal teeth or muscles is not suitable. In future space experiments, whole body treat-
ment with Davidson’s ﬁxative should be used for histological analyses.

This study focused on particular organs such as the ovary, intestine, testis, liver, brain, and
eyes, and analyzed the biological impact of the ISS environment on these organs. We aimed to
share samples among PIs in order to evaluate particular tissues. However, the evaluation of
blood vessels or alterations of small regions of tissues such as seen in atrophy is difﬁcult when
using this method. For such evaluation, it is necessary to make serial sections of the whole
body, and the size of Japanese medaka is small enough for that purpose [39]. The analysis of
whole body serial sections and RNA expression analysis isolated from each individual organ
will reveal physiological responses to the space environment at the molecular, cellular and tis-
sue levels, and demonstrate any variability between individuals. In addition, the preparation of
whole body serial sections would make it possible to share the results in the form of a database.
Therefore, as the next step in space experimentation, two kinds of experiments will be required:
further replicate experiments to evaluate RNA expression levels as biomarkers, and whole body
serial sectioning for sharing data among scientists.
