ABSTRACT
Polymers and other oxidizable materials used on the exterior of spacecraft in the low Earth
orbit (LEO) space environment can be eroded away by reaction with atomic oxygen (A0). For
spacecraft design, it is important to know the LEO AO erosion yield, Ey (volume loss per
incident oxygen atom), of materials susceptible to A0 erosion. The Stressed Polymers
Experiment was developed and ﬂown as part of the Materials International Space Station
Experiment 6 (MISSE 6) to compare the AO erosion yields of stressed and non-stressed
polymers to determine if erosion is dependent upon stress while in LEO. The experiment
contained 36 thin ﬁlm polymer samples that were exposed to ram A0 for 1.45 years. This paper
provides an overview of the Stressed Polymers Experiment with details on the polymers ﬂown,
the characterization techniques used, the AO ﬂuenoe, and the erosion yield results. The MISSE 6
data are compared to data for similar samples ﬂown on previous MISSE missions to determine
ﬂuenoe or solar radiation effects on erosion yield.
INTRODUCTION
Spacecraft in the low Earth orbit (LEO) environment (between 200 and 2000 km above the
surface of the Earth) endure extremely harsh conditions, including exposure to ultraviolet, X-ray,
and charged particle radiation; miorometeoroids and debris; A0, and temperature extremes.
Atomic oxygen is formed through photodissooiation of diatomic oxygen by short wavelength
ultraviolet radiation from the sun. Polymers and other oxidizable materials used on the exterior

"6","of spacecraft in the LEO space environment can, in most cases, be eroded away through reaction
with A0. Therefore, AO erosion poses a serious threat to spacecraft performance and durability.
In order to design durable high-performanoe spacecraft systems, it is essential to understand the
AO erosion yield (Ey) of materials being considered for spacecraft applications. The Ey is the
volume loss per incident oxygen atom (om3/atom). Materials spaceﬂight experiments for Ey
determination have been ﬂown on the Shuttle, the Long Duration Exposure Facility (LDEF), the
Russian space station Mir and other spacecraft. More recently, they have been a part of the
Materials International Space Station Experiment (MISSE) series ﬂown on the exterior of the
International Space Station (188).

Upon initial oleanroom inspection, samples ﬂown as part of MISSE 1 and 2, such as
MISSE 1 Gossamer Materials Experiment samples, appeared to have experienced excessive AO
erosion in bent or high stress regions. Therefore, the Stressed Polymers Experiment was
developed and ﬂown as part of the MISSE 6 with the primary objective to compare the AO
erosion yields of stressed and non-stressed polymers to determine if AO erosion is dependent
upon stress while in LEO.

This paper provides an introduction to the Stressed Polymers Experiment, details on the
speciﬁc polymers ﬂown, and a summary of the characterization techniques used. The A0
ﬂuenoe calculations are discussed along with a summary of the erosion yield results of the
stressed and the non-stressed samples. The MISSE 6 ﬂight data are compared to data for similar
samples ﬂown on previous MISSE missions to help determine ﬂuenoe or solar radiation effects
on LEO erosion yield.

MISSE 6 STRESSED POLYMERS EXPERIMENT

MISSE is a series of spaceﬂight experiments designed to test the performance and durability
of materials and devices exposed to the LEO space environment. MISSE consists of 11 ﬂight
experiment trays (10 Passive Experiment Carriers (PECs) and one smaller tray being ﬂown with
MISSE 8) that are mounted to the exterior of the International Space Station (188). Each two-
sided tray contains numerous individual ﬂight experiments and are positioned in either a
ram/wake orientation or a zenith/nadir orientation (Ref. 1). The Stressed Polymers Experiment
was located on the ram side of MISSE Passive Experiment Container (PEC) 6A, which was
deployed on the exterior of the 188 during the STS-123 shuttle mission on March 22, 2008. The
experiment was oriented to receive directed AO exposure during the maj ority of the mission. The
experiment remained in LEO for approximately 1.45 years, until it was retrieved during the STS-
128 shuttle mission on September 1, 2009. Figure 1 shows MISSE 6A & 6B on the exterior of
the Columbus Laboratory, as imaged in March 2008 during the STS-123 mission.

F igure 1. The International Space Station (photographed in March 2008) with
a close-up photo ofMISSE 6A and 63 on the Columbus Laboratory (Ref. 2).

The MISSE 6A Stressed Polymers Experiment contained 34 stacked thin ﬁlm polymer
samples for erosion yield determination and two DC 93-500 silicone samples for surface erazing
and hardness characterization. Twenty-four samples were ﬂown in a non-stressed conﬁguration
and 11 samples were duplicated, but ﬂown in a stressed conﬁguration. Six polymer materials that
were ﬂown as part of the MISSE 2 Polymer Erosion and Contamination Experiment (PEACE)
and had excessively degraded after four years of LEO exposure (Refs. 3 to 5) were included for
erosion yield determination. In addition, three stacked layers of Kapton® H of various thicknesses
(12.7 nm and 127 nm) were ﬂown, along with stacked Kapton® H (12.7 nm) with the layers
separated with spacers, to determine if ﬁlm thickness and/or spacing between layers has an effect
on erosion yield. Also, included were samples of aluminized-Teﬂon® ﬂuorinated ethylene
propylene (Al-FEP), 200 °C heated Al-FEP (380 hours in air), samples of Al-FEP previously
exposed to space on the Hubble Space Telescope (HST), and silvered-Teﬂon from the LDEF, to
determine if prior space exposure affects the erosion yield of PEP. Analyses of the HST and
LDEF samples are not listed in Table 1 and will not be reported in this paper.

MATERIALS

A list of the different materials exposed to AD as part of the MISSE 6 Stressed Polymers
experiment is given in Table 1, along with the material abbreviation, trade name(s), material
thickness and number of sample layers ﬂown.

The samples were ﬂown in three ram facing MISSE “W trays” that hold 15 — 1 in. square
(2.54 cm) samples each. The 11 stressed samples were ﬂown in the MISSE W2 tray (#1 stamped
on tray) and the non-stressed partner samples were ﬂown in identical tray locations in the MISSE
W3 tray (#2 stamped on tray). The stressed sample Ids are designated as “S#” and the non-
stressed sample Ids are “N#” (non-stressed samples ﬂown in the “stressed tray” were designated
as “N#-S”). The three layered Kapton samples were ﬂown in the MISSE W6 Tray and the
NASA/TM—20l3—2l7847 3

"
"8","sample Ids were W6-5, W6-9 and W6-10, as described in Table 1. The purpose of these samples
is to determine the effect of thickness (5 mil VS. 0.5 mil thick layers), and the effect of having
spaces between layers (i.e., using square A1 “frames” between layers to provide a gap between
layers). Figure 2 shows the locations of the three W trays 0n the Columbus Laboratory.

Figure 3 shows a pre-ﬂight photo of one of the stressed samples, Kapton CB (SS), in a
stressed holder. The stressed holders were designed to cover the edges of the samples providing a
clear exposure area. Because the stressed samples were to receive non-uniform AO ﬂux, a % in.
(0.635 cm) wide area at the edge of each sample was salt-sprayed so erosion depth around the
circumference of the sample using a recession depth technique could be determined, in case the
AO arrival was not normal (Ref. 6). A “retaining base” was used at the bottom of the samples to
keep the samples from bowing during loading and ﬂight. A post-ﬂight photo of the stressed
Kapton CB sample is shown in Figure 3, where the retaining base is visible on one side of the
sample.

EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURES

Erosion Yield Measurements
Erosion Yield Determination of Non-Stressed Samples
A common technique for determining the erosion yield (Ey) of materials is based on mass
loss of ﬂight samples and is calculated using dehydrated mass measurements before and after
ﬂight. The erosion yield of a ﬂat (non-stressed) sample is calculated through the following
equation:
Ey = Di (1)
(AspsF)
Where
Ey = Erosion yield of ﬂight sample (cm3/at0m)
W5 = Mass loss of the ﬂight sample (g)
AS = Surface area of the ﬂight sample exposed to A0 (01112)
pS = Density of ﬂight sample (g/cm3)
F = Fluence of AO (atoms/cm2)
NASA/TM—2013—217847 6

"
"11","The A0 ﬂuence (F ) can be determined through the mass loss of a Kapton H witness sample
because Kapton H has a well characterized erosion yield, EK (3.0 X 10'24 01113 /at0m) in the LEO
environment (Refs. 7 to 10) Therefore, the AO ﬂuenee can be calculated using the following
equation:

[W K
F = — (2)
(AK/OKEK)
where
F = LEO AO ﬂuence (atoms/em2)
WK = Mass loss of Kapton H witness sample (g)
A K = Surface area of Kapton H witness sample exposed to A0 (01112)
pK = Density of Kapton H witness sample (1.4273 g/em3)
E K = Erosion yield of Kapton H witness sample (3.0 X 10'24 01113 /at0m)

A non-stressed Kapton H witness sample, N8 in MISSE 6A ram sample tray W2 was ﬂown
to determine the AO ﬂuence of the ram surfaces of MISSE 6A.
Erosion Yield of Stressed Samples

The estimate of the erosion yield of the stressed polymers was based on the volume eroded
per incident atom. This was done because the ﬂux was variable over the curved surfaces and the
area of exposure was not normal to the arriving ﬂux direction. Thus

M
E y = D—5 (3)
(AW)
where
N = Number of atoms arriving at the surface of the polymer
To determine the number, M of atoms arriving at the cylindrical polymer surface, the ﬂux was
integrated over the surface using the nearly cosine distribution of arriving atoms. Thus,
11/ 2
N = 2 FOWR f0 f(6)d6 (4)
where
F 0 = Ram ﬂuenee, atoms/cm2
W: Width of the exposed area of cylindrical shaped polymer (1.52 cm)
R = Outside radius of the polymer cylinder (0.635 cm)
f ( (9) = Fluence per angle as a function of angle 6 around the polymer cylinder, atoms/cm2
6 = Angle from normal incidence, radians
NASA/TM—2013-217847 7

"
"12","The ﬂuenee angular dependence closely follows a cosine distribution until near grazing
incidence where at normal incidence the ﬂuence is 0.041 that of the ram ﬂuence. The angular
ﬂuenee dependence is reported by Silverman in reference (Ref. 10). Slight corrections amounting
to less than 2% t0 the integration were also performed to correct for parts of the polymer
cylinders that were covered up in the grazing incidence areas.

Dehydrated Mass Loss Measurements

Because many polymers are hygroscopic and can take 011 moisture, which can inﬂuence mass
loss and hence erosion yield values, samples were vacuum dehydrated prior to being weighed.
For both pre- and post-ﬂight mass measurements, all samples were vacuum-dehydrated at 60-
100 mtorr for a minimum of 72 hours and then weighed with a Mettler M3 Balance. Records
were kept of time under vacuum, sequence of weighing, and room temperature and humidity.
The same sequence and procedures used for the pre-ﬂight measurements were repeated post-
ﬂight as well as possible.

Density Measurements

The densities of the samples were based on density column measurements of polymers for
the MISSE 2 PEACE Polymers experiment (Refs. 3 t0 5). The density gradient columns were
created in 50-mL burets with solvents of either cesium chloride (CsCl) and water (H2O), for less
dense polymers, or carbon tetrachloride (CCl4) and bromoform (CHBr3), for more dense
polymers. Glass standards of known densities were placed in the column and allowed to settle,
and then small pieces of various polymers were placed in the columns. A curve was ﬁt to the
positions and densities of the glass standards. Plotting the positions of the test polymers 0n the
curve yielded density values for each material. Where possible the same batch of material was
used for MISSE 6 as it was for MISSE 2. Manufacturers” densities were used for Kapton XC and
Kapton E, as they were not ﬂown as part of the PEACE experiment.

S urface Area Measurements

The exposed surface area of the non-stressed samples were determined by taking three
different width measurements and three different length measurements of each sample tray
opening. The average width was multiplied by the average length to compute the area of the
square opening. But, the trays have rounded corners with a 0.062 in. (0.15748 em) radius.
Therefore 0.02129 01112 (the area of the four rounded corners) was subtracted from each square
area to get the actual sample area. The exposed surface area for the N8 Kapton ﬂuence samples
was determined based on obtaining 24 measurements of the sample openings (12 vertical and 12
horizontal).

Sample Stacking

The thin ﬁlm samples were stacked so that the total thickness of each sample was the same.
The thickness of the stressed materials ranged from 1 mil (0.00254 em) to 20 mils (0.0508 cm)
thick. Therefore, the total thickness was determined to be 20 mils for both the stressed and non-
stressed sample pairs, as seen in Table 1. Having samples 20 mils thick ensured that all the
NASA/TM—2013-217847 8

"13","samples would survive a mission several years longer than planned, in case the experiment was
not retrieved when planned. For weighing, the samples were divided into 2 different parts: Part
A, which consisted of the top space exposed layer, and Part B, which was made up of all
additional layers. Part A and Part B were weighed separately post-ﬂight. This was done so that
only Part A could be weighed post—ﬂight, if only the top layer experienced erosion during ﬂight.
An illustration of sample layer stacking is provided in Figure 4.

where:

R = The radius of curvature of the mid-thickness of the polymer, cm (~0.609 cm)
Thus, thick polymers had more surface strain than multiple layers of thin polymers. The strain at
external surface of the stressed samples has been computed for each of the stressed samples and
is reported in the MISSE 6 LEO Erosion Yields section along with the erosion yield values.
RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
Initial Inspection
Figures 5 and 6 provide pre-ﬂight and post-ﬂight photos of the W3 (stressed) and W2 (non-
stressed) sample trays, respectively. As can be seen in Figure 2, the stressed sample tray (W3)
was to the left of the non-stressed samples tray (W2). In the W3 tray, samples UpileX-S, CPI,
Kapton E, PE, FBI and PMMA appeared to have multiple layers eroded through the top layer.
Figure 7 provides an example of sample layer erosion. Typically, LEO ram erosion results in a
change in surface appearance from shiny to matte, as shown in Figure 8. This surface change is
due to the development of microscopic cones developed during directed ram exposure (Ref. 11).
NASA/TM—2013—217847 9

"
"14","In addition, substantial color changes occurred in UpileX-S, CPI, Kapton E, Kapton H, Mylar A,
PMR-IS, ADC and PMMA. For example, Mylar A changed from White to a dark yellow, and
colorless samples ADC and PMMA turned White. Color changes can be due to thickness loss
(i.e., erosion) and erosion texture, or solar radiation darkening. Likewise, in the W2 tray, color
changes and erosion are observed in samples UpileX-S, CPI, Kapton E, Kapton H, Mylar A, PE
and PEI. Yellowing of sample Mylar A is shown by comparing the ﬂight and control samples in
Figure 9 (see N9). A micrometeoroid 0r orbital debris impact occurred in one of the solar cell
samples (N15) included in the W2 tray, shown in Figure 5. Upon close inspection of the samples,
the majority of salt particles appear to have remained present 011 the samples, except Where
complete erosion of a surface layer has occurred. An example is provided in the pre- and post-
ﬂight photos of the Kapton CB sample in Figure 3(a) and Figure 3(b), respectively, and also in
the optical micrograph of Kapton H in Figure 10.

MISSE 6A A0 F luence and Solar Exposure

The MISSE 6A ram AO ﬂuence for the Stressed Polymers Experiment was computed based
on the mass loss of the 1 in. (2.54 cm) square non-stressed Kapton H witness sample (N8). The
data used to compute the AO ﬂuence are provided in Table 2. This sample was positioned to be
as close to the center of the two trays (W2 & W3) as possible, as seen in Figure 2. The Kapton H
sample consisted of four 5 mil (0.0127 cm) thick layers for a total thickness of 20 mils
(0.0508 cm). Erosion only occurred in the top layer (Part A), as shown in Figure 11, hence only
pre-ﬂight and post-ﬂight mass of Part A was needed for ﬂuenee determination. Based on the W2
Kapton H analyses, the MISSE7B ram ﬂuence and standard deviation was determined to be
1.97 i 0.05 X 1021 atoms/em2.

Estimates of MISSE 6 solar exposures for the ram and wake surfaces were obtained using the
Boeing Integrated ISS TRASYS model for solar exposure levels for the surface of the Columbus
module near the location of MISSE 6. The solar exposure for the MISSE 6 ram surfaces was
estimated at 2,600 equivalent sun hours (ESH) and the solar exposure for MISSE 6 wake
surfaces was estimated at 1,950 ESH (Ref. 12). Because of the curved shape of the MISSE 6
stressed samples, the ESH was non-uniform across the sample surface, with the 2,600 ESH at the
crown of the sample.

MISSE 6 LEO Erosion Yields
Table 3 provides the LEO erosion yield data for the MISSE 6A stressed and n0n-stressed
sample pairs from trays W3 and W2, respectively, along with the sample mass loss, strain at the
external surface of the stressed samples, and the ratio of stressed to non-stressed By. The DC 93-
500 sample was not analyzed for By as DC 93-500 does not erode with A0 exposure but
develops surface Grazing (Ref. 13). Based on prior ﬂight samples, it was expected that the By 0f
the stressed samples would be greater than the non-stressed samples. As can be seen in the ratio
of stressed to non-stressed Ey values in Table 3, seven of the materials (UpileX-S (S3/N3),
Kapton CB (SS/NS), Kapton XC (S6/N6), Kapton E (S7/N7), Kapton H (SS/NS), Mylar A
(S9/N9) and PE (SlO/N 10)) had ratios at or near 1.0. Three samples had stressed-to-unstressed
Ey ratios beyond i 10% of each other, which is believed to be beyond the uncertainty of the data.
Two materials, Teﬂon PTFE (Sl/Nl) and Teﬂon FEP (SZ/N2), had stressed Ey values which
were lower than the non-stressed Ey values with ratios of 0.76 and 0.83, respectively. As the
stressed polymers had a lower average number of sun hours on them than the ﬂat samples
because of the variation of the angle to the sun on the stressed samples, having the stressed to
non-stressed Ey ratios below 1.0 for ﬂuoropolymers is consistent with ﬁndings that solar
exposure has an impact on the By 0f ﬂuorinated polymers. These results are conﬁrmed in the
Teﬂon FEP section below. The CP1 Sample (S4) was the only sample with a signiﬁcantly higher
stressed Ey than the non-stressed sample, with a stressed to non-stressed Ey ratio of 1.11.

>“Stressed samples surface strain

In general these results were surprising as only 1 sample indicated a higher Ey while being
stressed on-orbit. And, the two ﬂuoropolymer samples appear to have lower Ey values when
stressed on-orbit. As indicated before, due to the cylindrical shape of the samples, the AO
ﬂuenoe is non-uniform across the surface, which complicates the analyses. Therefore, to verify
these results, it would be beneﬁcial to determine the By of the samples based on recession depth
analyses at salt-proteoted areas, particularly at normal incidence were the ram ﬂuenoe is known
based on analyses of the non-stressed Kapton H sample (N8). It would also be of interest to
simplify the geometry of the samples being exposed to A0 and ﬂy ﬂat samples that are under
tensile loading on-orbit. An experiment with ﬂat tensile loaded samples has been proposed for
ﬂight as part of the Polymers and Composites Experiment being ﬂown as part of the Materials
International Space Station Experiment-X (MISSE-X) (Refs. 14 and 15).

An AO pinhole camera consisting of a metal oriﬁce plate spaced away from a Kapton H ﬁlm
was used to provide a qualitative history of arrival AO ﬂuenoe for MISSE 6 ram A0. The results
indicate that, for a portion of the AO exposure, the ﬂuence was arriving at an angle of
approximately 12.80 off normal. Because the duration of time the off—normal ﬂuX was arriving is
not known, the ﬂuence computation for the stressed samples could be lower than predicted by
the ﬂat Kapton H witness samples by up to 2.5%. This would be a result of 128° inclined
incidence of AC on the half—oylinder shaped samples. The possible consequence of this is that
the erosion yields for the stressed polymers could be up to 2.5% greater than the values
calculated in Table 3.

Table 4 provides the LEO erosion yield data for the additional MISSE 6A non-stressed
samples ﬂown in trays W3 and W2, along with the sample thickness, number of layers ﬂown,
density, mass loss and surface area.

The MISSE 6B ram AO ﬂuenoe for the W6 tray was computed based on the mass loss of the
1 in. (2.54 cm) square non-stressed Kapton H witness sample (W6-5). The data used to compute
the AO ﬂuenoe are provided in Table 5. The Kapton H sample consisted of three 5 mil
(0.0127 cm) thick layers for a total thickness of 15 mils (0.0381 cm). Erosion only occurred in
the top layer (Part A), hence only pre-ﬂight and post-ﬂight mass of Part A was needed for
ﬂuenoe determination. Based on the W2 Kapton H analyses, the MISSE 6B ram ﬂuenee was
determined to be 1.90 i 0.05 X 1021 atoms/om2.

Images of the stacked gossamer thin Kapton H samples ﬂown in the W6 tray are shown in
Figure 12. The Kapton H sample without the spacers between the 10—0.5 mil thick layers (W6-
10) was found to have an Ey of 3.08 X 10'24 om3/atom. Although error analyses were not
conducted to determine the error in the By values, the data analyses were similar to those used
for By determination of the MISSE 2 PEACE Polymers eXperiment, and the error for the Kapton
H samples for that eXperiment were 0.0741 X 10'24 om3/atom (Ref. 16). Thus based on these error
values, the MISSE 6 0.5 mil thick layered Kapton H sample had a barely signiﬁcant increase in
By as compared to the 5 mil layered Kapton H ﬂuenoe witness sample. The Kapton H sample
with the 0.014 in. (0.0356 cm) thick A1 spacers between the 10—0.5 mil layers was found to have
an Ey of 3.25 X 10'24 om3/atom, which is a signiﬁcant increase in By. As can be seen in
Figure 12, AO completely eroded the top four layers and has partially eroded the ﬁfth layer, but
NASA/TM—2013-217847 15

"
"20","the sample With the spacers has resulted in more erosion to the ﬁfth layer, than the sample
Without the spacers. This is believed to be attributed to trapping and scattering of AO between
the layers in the gap between the layers. The degradation of the individual layers shown in
Figure 12 also show how a ehamfered tray opening, as used for the W tray, can concentrate the
A0, and thus cause higher erosion at the perimeter of the samples.

Erosion Yield vs. LEO Fluence

A comparison of the By values of the MISSE 6 non-stressed erosion yields and the same
material ﬂown as part of the MISSE 2 PEACE Polymer experiment are provided in Table 6. The
MISSE 2 PEACE experiment was exposed to ram A0 011 MISSE PEC 2 for nearly 4 years and
received an A0 ﬂuence of 8.43 X 1021 atoms/em2 and solar exposure of 6,300 ESH (Refs. 3 t0 5).
The ratio of MISSE 2 t0 MISSE 6 By values are provided in Table 6. As stated previously, six of
the MISSE 2 samples were excessively eroded and hence their Ey value is greater than the value
computed for the MISSE 2 ﬂight experiment.

As can be seen in Table 6, the By of many polymers (UplieX-S, CP1, PET and possibly PE,
FBI and ADC) decreases with increasing AO ﬂuence and ESH exposure. This is believed to be
due to A0 protective inorganic ash from the bulk of the polymers building up on the surface, as
these particles (10 not erode away, and can then provide some protection to the material below
(Ref. 17). The samples that did not follow this trend included: PMMA, PMR-15, and the two
ﬂuoropolymers, FEP and PTFE. Note that PBI was completely eroded away on MISSE 2, and
hence the MISSE 2 By was very low.

The MISSE 6 PMR-15 sample was found to have white residue on the surface, as shown in
Figure 13, which might have protected it during ﬂight affecting the By. The MISSE 2 sample did
not have any residue and only had a very small area of through-thickness erosion; hence the
MISSE 2 By is believed to be fairly accurate. Both of the MISSE 2 and MISSE 6 PMMA
samples had small gossamer pieces that were lost during post-ﬂight handling as shown in
Figure 14. Also, the MISSE 2 sample was completely eroded through all layers in the center of
the sample. Thus, it is not known which Ey may be more accurate. It is desired to re-ﬂy these
materials on a future MISSE experiment.

The probable reason that the ratios of MISSE 2 t0 MISSE 6 By for PTFE and FEP were
greater than 1 is that the solar exposure (ESH) appears to dominate and overwhelm any
protection due to ash content for ﬂuoropolymers. This is supported by the ESH dependence
discussed in the Teﬂon FEP section below.

SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS

The MISSE 6A Stressed Polymers EXperiment was successfully ﬂown on the eXterior 0f the
ISS and eXposed t0 the ram AO space environment for 1.45 years. Atomic 0Xygen Ey values
have been determined for 10 stressed samples and 17 non-stressed samples based on dehydrated
mass loss measurements. The A0 ﬂuence of the MISSE 6A tray was determined to be 1.97 i
0.05 X 1021 atoms/cm2 and the AO ﬂuence of the MISSE 6B tray was determined to be 1.90 i
0.05 X 1021 atoms/em2, based on Kapton H witness samples. The Ey values were found to range
between 1.01 X 10'250m3/at0m for stressed PTFE to 8.28 X 10'24 em3/at0m for ADC.

Samples of thick (5 mil) and thin (0.5 mil) stacked Kapton H layers were found to produce
interesting results. The Kapton H sample with 0.5 mil thick layers (W6-10, n0 spacers) was
found to have an Ey of 3.08 X 10'24 em3/at0m, which is slightly larger than that for the 5 mil thick
Kapton H ﬂuenee witness sample, indicating that polymers with multiple thin layers have a
higher Ey than for the same material ﬂown as a thicker layer. The Kapton H sample with spacers
between the 0.5 mil layers was found to have an Ey of 3.25 X 10'24 em3/at0m, which is
signiﬁcantly greater than the By for the same material with the layers stacked tightly together.
This is believed to be attributed to trapping and scattering of AO between the gaps.

"25","Surprisingly, the stressed to non-stressed erosion ratios of seven polymers were found to be
near 1.0. The two ﬂuoropolymers, Teﬂon PTFE (SUN 1) and Teﬂon FEP (S2/N2), had stressed
Ey values which were lower than the non-stressed Ey values with ratios of 0.76 and 0.83,
respectively. This is attributed to the lower total solar exposure for the stressed conﬁguration.
The CP1 Sample (S4) was the only sample with a signiﬁcantly higher stressed Ey than the non-
stressed sample, with a stressed to non-stressed Ey ratio of 1.11. An AO pinhole camera
indicated that, for a portion of the AO exposure, the ﬂuence was arriving at an angle of
approximately 12.80 off normal. The possible consequence of this is that the By vales for the
stressed polymers could be up to 2.5% greater than the values reported. Desired future work
includes obtaining Ey values for the stressed samples using recession depth measurements at salt
locations. It would also be of interest to simplify the geometry of the samples being exposed to
AD by ﬂying ﬂat samples that are under tensile loading on-orbit. An experiment with ﬂat tensile
loaded samples has been proposed for ﬂight as part of the Polymers and Composites Experiment
being ﬂown as part of MISSE-X.

The MISSE 6 By values were compared to By values for similar materials ﬂown on MISSE 2
with higher AO ﬂuenoe and ESH exposure. The Ey for most samples (except the ﬂuoropolymers
(FEP and PTFE), PMR-15, PMMA, and PEI) were found to decrease with increasing AO ﬂuenoe
and ESH exposure. Ey for PMR-15 and PMMA were found to have been compromised. The Ey
of Teﬂon FEP ﬂown on various MISSE missions (2, 4 and 6), LDEF and HST were plotted in
numerous ways including: Ey vs. against AO ﬂuenoe, time on-orbit, ESH and ESH/AO ratio, and
the best ﬁt was found for By versus ESH. Increased Ey values of ﬂuoropolymers for various
missions are believed to be attributed to some combination of greater sun hours, temperature and
possibly X-rays, not AO ﬂuenoe.

13. SUPPLEMENTARY NOTES
14. ABSTRACT
Polymers and other oxidizable materials used on the exterior of spacecraft in the low Earth orbit (LEO) space environment can be eroded
away by reaction with atomic oxygen (A0). For spacecraft design, it is important to know the LEO A0 erosion yield, Ey (volume loss per
incident oxygen atom), of materials susceptible to A0 erosion. The Stressed Polymers Experiment was developed and ﬂown as part of the
Materials International Space Station Experiment 6 (MISSE 6) to compare the A0 erosion yields of stressed and non-stressed polymers to
determine if erosion is dependent upon stress while in LEO. The experiment contained 36 thin ﬁlm polymer samples that were exposed to
ram A0 for 1.45 years. This paper provides an overview of the Stressed Polymers Experiment with details on the polymers ﬂown, the
characterization techniques used, the A0 ﬂuence, and the erosion yield results. The MISSE 6 data are compared to data for similar samples
ﬂown on previous MISSE missions to determine ﬂuence 0r solar radiation effects on erosion yield.
