Abstract
Mitochondrial damage is a well known cause of mitochondria—related diseases. A major mechanism underlying the development of
mitochondria—related diseases is thought to be an increase in intracellular oxidative stress produced by impairment of the mitochondrial
electron transport chain (ETC). However, clear evidence of intracellular free radical generation has not been clearly provided for mito—
chondrial DNA (mtDNA)—damaged cells. In this study, using the novel ﬂuorescence dye, 2—[6—(4’—hydroxy)phenoxy—3H—Xanthen—3—on—
9—yl]benzoic acid (HPF), which was designed to detect hydroxyl radicals (OH), intracellular free radical formation was examined in
143B cells (parental cells), 143B—pO cells (mtDNA—lacking cells), 87 wt (cybrid), and cybrids of 4977—bp mtDNA deletion (common dele—
tion) cells containing the deletion with 0%, 5%, 50% and >99% frequency (HeLacot, BH5, BH50 and BH3.12, respectively), using a laser
confocal microscope detection method. ETC inhibitors (rotenone, 3—nitropropionic acid, thenoyltriﬂuoroacetone, antimycin A and sodi—
um cyanide) were also tested to determine whether inhibitor treatment increased intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation. A
signiﬁcant increase in ROS for 143B—pO cells was observed compared with 143B cells. However, for the 87 wt cybrid, no increase was
observed. An increase was also observed in the mtDNA—deleted cells BH50 and BH3.12. The ETC inhibitors increased intracellular
ROS in both 143B and 143B—pO cells. Furthermore, in every ﬂuorescence image, the ﬂuorescence dye appeared localized around the nuclei.
To clarify the localization, we double—stained cells with the dye and MitoTracker Red. The resulting ﬂuorescence was consistently located
in mitochondria. Furthermore, manganese superoxide dismutase (MnSOD) cDNA—transfected cells had decreased ROS. These results
suggest that more ROS are generated from mitochondria in ETC—inhibited and mtDNA—damaged cells, which have impaired ETC.

mitochondria was observed for DHR, whereas DCF and HE ﬂuorescence was not clearly localized in the mitochondria. Note that DHR is positively
charged, and thus accumulated in mitochondria.

Fig. 5. MnSOD suppresses intracellular ROS generation in 143B-p0 cells. To ascertain whether the ROS detected by HPF ﬂuorescence are generated by
mitochondria, cDNA of MnSOD, which is located in the mitochondria and scavenges mitochondrial superoxide, was transfected into 143B, 143B-p0 and
87 wt cells, then HPF ﬂuorescence intensities were compared among cell types. A tendency for a lower ﬂuorescence intensity after MnSOD transfection
was observed in all cells types. In 143B-p0 cells, a signiﬁcant difference was observed relative to the controls, which were transformed by the vector only,
indicating that ROS generation in these cells, which generated the highest level of ROS among these three cell lines (143B, 143B-p0 and 87 wt), was
suppressed most by transfection with MnSOD.
