Abstract
At present, the most popular protein crystallization method is vapor equilibration Via the hanging drop method. This
method, however, offers little control over the rate of equilibration between the growth solution and the reservoir.
A device has been developed by the Center for Macromolecular Crystallography at the University of Alabama at
Birmingham that offers precise control of vapor equilibration in the hanging drop method. We report herein qualitative
crystallization data for selected proteins utilizing this device. These studies demonstrate that a slower controlled
evaporation rate of protein growth solution generally resulted in smaller populations of larger protein crystals. © 2000
