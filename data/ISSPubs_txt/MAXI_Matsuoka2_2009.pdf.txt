Abstract. MAXI, the ﬁrst astronomical payload attached to 18$ JEM-EF, began operation on
August 3, 2009 for monitoring all-sky X-ray images every 188 orbit (92 min). This paper reports
the ﬁrst results obtained during the 1-month test observations. A11 instruments as well as two main
X-ray slit cameras, the GSC and SSC, worked as we expected. The detection limits of MAXI-GSC
are about 25 mCrab and 8 mCrab for one 188 orbit (92 min) and 1-day observations, respectively.
GSC covers about 76% and 96% of the entire sky for respective single-orbit and 1-day observations.
MAXI has detected a transient X-ray pulsar A0535+26, an X-ray burst, and a gamma—ray burst in
the ﬁrst month of the test observation period.

INTRODUCTION
Recently MAXI (Monitor of All-sky X-ray Image) has started to operate its cameras,
which are capable of monitoring all-sky X-ray images. We are pleased that we can
present the ﬁrst light from MAXI onboard JEM (Kibo) - Exposed Facility (EF) on the
188 in a timely manner. The MAXI mission is the ﬁrst astronomical payload attached
to the Japanese Experiment Module - Exposed Facility (JEM-EF or Kibo-EF) on the
International Space Station (188). MAXI was launched with Endeavour on July 16,
2009. The commission of MAXI started on August 3, 2009 when MAXI instruments
were ﬁrst switched on. We will tune various settings and observational modes of MAXI
to target for steady observation from December, 2009. Meanwhile, two kinds of X-ray

"
"2","cameras, GSC and SSC (Matsuoka et al. 2009), have been used for test observations.
At the ﬁrst step of test observations all instruments of MAXI worked well and gave us
normal data.

The GSC and SSC of MAXI have X-ray detectors consisting of gas proportional
counters covering the energy range of 2 to 30 keV and X-ray CCDs covering the energy
range of 0.5 to 12 keV, respectively. Both cameras scan all-sky X-ray images twice due
to two different directional cameras every 92 minutes synchronized with the ISS orbit.
The data are sent from the 188 to a ground station Via data-relay satellites. The transient
alert system on the ground rapidly reports X-ray novae or bursting events with 0.1 to 0.2
degree position accuracy to astronomers worldwide for further follow-up observations
(Negoro et al. 2009). Furthermore, scans of each source are combined on the ground to
detect weak sources including AGNs.

FUNDAMENTAL RESULTS OF MAXI INSTRUMENTS

After all the instruments were powered on to normal settings, we checked calibration
data for twelve proportional counters. All data giving the pulse height distributions
and positions of 55Fe calibration sources were normal, little different from the pre-
launch data. It was conﬁrmed that a point spread function for a point source was also
normal using an image of Crab Nebula. A check of the energy spectrum and sensitivity
was made using the observational data of the Crab Nebula. The spectrum of the Crab
Nebula is consistent with a well-known spectrum giving a power law index of 2.1 and
a little absorption column density although further calibration of low-energy efﬁciency
is required. The sensitivity with MAXI-GSC was estimated from the observational data
of the Crab Nebula. The estimation suggests that MAXI-GSC is capable of detecting 25
mCrab for one orbit and 8 mCrab for 1-day in the 5-sigrna level. These sensitivities
are a little worse than the simulated ones, because the background particle ﬂux is
unexpectedly stronger in the ISS environment.

MAXI has the radiation belt monitors, i.e. two sets of pin-diode type solid-state
detectors sensitive to particles such as precipitation electrons and protons from radiation
belts. The particle radiation around SAA was as usual, as we learned from the low orbit
X-ray satellites, Ginga, ASCA and Suzaku. However, precipitation electrons increased
according to pitch angle distribution at high latitude regions beyond $40 degrees. On
the other hand the proportional counters of MAXI-GSC detected a strong background
30 — 50 times to 200 times as high as the background anticipated from the previous
data of low earth orbit srnall (<1 ton) satellites. We understand that a background of
200 times (sometimes 1000 times) in a high latitude region comes from precipitation
electrons around an auroral region, while the background is stronger by 30 — 50 times
for normal satellites even in the equatorial region. We suppose that the latter background
comes from the secondary cosmic-rays produced at the massive (N400 tons) structure
of the 188 by primary cosmic-rays. Even if the particle background is high, the present
proportional counter system can reduce non-X-ray background to 1.5 — 5 times that of
the Ginga LAC (Turner et al. 1989) with our excellent veto-systern.

The SSC of MAXI uses 16 CCDs for horizontal and azimuthal directions respectively
(Matsuoka et al. 2009). All CCDs were tentatively cooled down to —60 0C, and test

observations were made from the middle of August, 2009. Each energy resolution for
CCDs was checked using 55Fe calibration sources and the Cu K-lines, which is produced
as ﬂuorescent lines from a slat collimator made of phosphide bronze plate. Distribution
for all CCDs showed an energy resolution of about 147 eV for Mn Koc line without
correction of pixel data. The SSC is very sensitive to Visible light even though the CCDs
are covered with an Al optical blocking ﬁlter. In the ﬁrst test observation during daytime
on the 188, all CCDs were noisy by stray solar light. Therefore, we ﬁrst performed all-
sky test observations during the night time. We have conﬁrmed that the SSC detected
many X-ray sources in the Galactic center region, and the Crab Nebula. Currently we
are adjusting levels and modes to be capable of making day-tirne observation.

HOW DOES MAXI OBSERVE THE ENTIRE SKY?

As we mentioned in the introduction MAXI has two sets of slit cameras: horizontal
and azimuthal. In accordance with one 188 orbit, each set scans the sky with a ﬁeld of
View (FOV) of 160 degrees, but both cameras cannot scan around the solar region, and
some directions to be scanned while high voltage is made to shutdown due to the high
radian zone. However, the latter regions are compensated considerably by an alternate
directional camera. If the region of high voltage reduction is limited to the SAA only,
MAXI-GSC can scan 96% of the sky, where it cannot observe two polar regions of 10
degrees and a solar region of i5 degrees (adjustable). At the time of test observations we
examined how we could reduce the solar region without damage. We have discovered
that there is no problem until it reaches the sun avoid angle of i4 degrees. We can scan
96% of the sky on every orbit except for the ﬁnal i4 degrees of the avoided angles. This
means that no ASM has ever scanned such a wide swath of sky so deeply in such a short
time, while it is noted that MAXI usually observes a source for only 45 seconds or 90
seconds on every orbit. Figure 1 shows two samples of all-sky images obtained in one
188 orbit (92 min) and l-day observations, respectively.

MAXI has a nova alert system to utilize the characteristics of the GSC. MAXI is
monitoring each single orbit map, 4-orbit integrated map, l-day map, and so on in

FIGURE 2. Type—I X—ray burst from 4U1724—307 (right panel) was discovered with MAXI—GSC at
18:37(UT) on August 20, 2009 as indicated as the transient. X—rays from 4U1724—307 before and after

real time as long as communication is available (Negoro et al. 2009). New objects
or suddenly brightened objects are monitored by comparing the present image with
previous images. Once a new object or suddenly brightened object is discovered, the
nova alert system will work to issue the alert with time, location, and intensity to
astronomers worldwide.

Although data communication on the 188 is relayed by DRTS, about half of the data
are downloaded in real time, and the remaining half are downloaded after a nominal one-
hour delay through the memory on the 188. Furthermore, although we tried to switch
on even during strong precipitated electrons in the ﬁrst test phase, at present all high
voltages are reduced in a high latitude because the background is too high.

SOME TOPIC S OF MAXI PRELIMINARY OBSERVATIONS
Type I X-ray burst from 4U1724-307 in Terzan 2

The duty scientist who was staying up all night, watching the alert system in the test
phase, discovered a bursting object near the Galactic center. Since MAXI was still in
commission phase, the MAXI team members checked carefully whether this event was
a burst 0r nova. First, they analyzed the location of this new source. Then, they found
that the location is consistent with 4Ul724-307 within an uncertainty of 1 degree. This
event appeared in just single scan orbit as shown in Figure 2. 4U1724-307 is well-known
as an X-ray burster. Thus, we decided this event was a typical Type-I X-ray burst.

Detection of GRB090831A

Another bursting obj ect was discovered clearly in the Ursa Major region. This burst
was detected fortunately in the FOV 0f the GSC. Since the intensity of this burst was
as strong as 30 Crab unit, we could ﬁnd this burst-up immediately. We checked the
map before this was detected. There was no source above 0.1 Crab. At that time, MAXI
was operating just after the space shuttle, Discovery, was attached to the ISS and the
188 had turned by 180 degrees half a day earlier. We carefully examined what may or

may not have happened in these special maneuvers. We are convinced that this event
was not connected with any 188 or instrumental events. Thus, we analyzed the location
and intensity according to the time sequence. A double check and triple check were
performed even though the soft-ware and data communication were still in the test phase.
More than 10 hours passed after discovery. Meanwhile, Fermi team reported the location
of new GRBO90831A which was consistent with that of MAXI. Thus we have conﬁrmed
GRBO90831A(GCN 9852). The location of this burst is shown in Figure 3 with other
Satellites (GCN 9864). GRBO90831A has very hard spectrum and very short time peak.
Surprisingly this GRB was detected accidentally just in the narrow ﬁeld of View of
MAXI-GSC, 3 x 160 degrees. A detection probability with MAXI-GSC is estimated to
be a few times per year.

Observation of a recurrent X-ray pulsar, A0535+26

When GSC started to switch on high voltages one by one, a recurrent X-ray pulsar,
A0535+26, was already in increasing phase as shown in Figure 3. After this source
achieved a peak intensity of 400 mCrab in the energy band of 2-30 keV on August 14,
the source decreased gradually up to an upper limit around 7-8 mCrab for 1-day to the
end of August, 2009.
Observations of AGN, Cen A and Cen cluster of galaxies
Preliminary analysis gave signiﬁcant intensities from the Cen A and Centaurus cluster

of galaxies. Both sources are seen signiﬁcantly in wide and narrow FOV of the 1-day
observation as shown in Figure 4. The intensity in the energy band of 2-20 keV was
about 20 mCrab for Cen A. This is stronger than that of the 5-sigma detectability of the
1-day observation. Thus we have conﬁrmed being able to monitor some of AGN in a
1-day observation.

SUMMARY AND FUTURE PROSPECT
MAXI on 188 JEM-EF worked excellently in the ﬁrst test phase during August, 2009.
We have learned of the high background situation on the 188. Since we had believed that
MAXI proportional counters could stand strong irradiation and worked well with veto-
detection, we performed various tests even in high latitude, the precipitation electron
regions. Unfortunately two proportional counters met trouble due to a malfunction of
anode wires. Therefore, currently all high voltages are reduced in the high background
region over $40 degrees of latitude. Nevertheless , the main function of the all-sky mon-
itor is maintained for sending rapid nova and burst results from MAXI to astronomers
worldwide. The MAXI nova-alert system (Negoro et al. 2009) is going to work and light
curves and some spectra of considerable X-ray sources are also going to be public. Com-
bined data for individual sources will be edited for variable catalogues in future. This is
the ﬁrst report of MAXI results obtained in 1-month test observations. Please access the
MAXI web-site, http : / /maxi . riken . jp / for further information.

M. Matsuoka would like to express his deepest gratitude to SOC and LOC for inviting
him in commemoration of 70th birthday of Prof. Giorgio Palumbo. MM wishes person-
ally to express congratulations to Prof. Giorgio Palumbo on his 70th birthday. We are
reminded of the Japanese legend, which originated with the Chinese poet, Toho, that
gives a person of 70 years a special celebration. Toho’s poem suggests that a person who
is able to live up to 70 years old was very rare historically in 8th century. Therefore, a 70-
year—old person should be celebrated. This is a traditional Japanese custom. However,
since a person to living to 70 is not rare nowadays, Giorgio can, of course, enjoy a new
advanced life past 70. Thus Giorgio will give us useful advice with his activity. Please
take care of your health, so you may enj oy your life to come.
