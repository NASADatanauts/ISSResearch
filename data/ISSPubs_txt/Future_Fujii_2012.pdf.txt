Abstract: The amount of waste heat in a space facility became larger, because of increase in the space platform size and its power
consumption. It requires development of high-perfortnance space thermal management systems handling a large amount of waste.
Boiling two-phase ﬂow could become powerful means for this system because a boiling and condensation system is one of the most
efﬁcient modes of heat transfer due to phase change (1iquid-vapor). However, gravity effects on boiling two-phase ﬂow phenomena and
the corresponding heat transfer characteristics are not clear. Therefore, we prepare the experiments of boiling two-phase ﬂow utilizing
a long-term microgravity environment onboard a J apanese Experimental Module “KIBO” in the International Space Station (ISS) as
one of the JAXA ofﬁcial projects. In this paper, recent progress of the preparation for the project is reported.
Key words: Boiling two-phase ﬂow, space science, space technology, ISS experiment, microgravity.
