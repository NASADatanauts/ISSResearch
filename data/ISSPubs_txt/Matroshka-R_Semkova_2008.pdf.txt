On 28 Jane, 2007 the experiment Lialin-S for investigation of ionising radiation distribution in a human
phantom was started aboard the International Space Station (155). Since then the Lialin-S experiment is
conducted in the Russian Segment of 155 as adherent part of the international project MATROSHKA-R for
studying the space radiation doses distribution at the human bogy, using human models —tissae — equivalent
phantoms. The particle telescope Lialin-S measures energy deposition spectra, linear energy transfer (LET)
spectrum, ﬂax and absorbed dose rates for electrons, protons and the biologically relevant heavy ion
components of the cosmic radiation at diﬂerent depths of the spherical phantom’s radial Channel. Presently data
are available for the period 28 Jane 2007-08 April 2008. In this report we present some results ofanalysis 0f the
data for dose and ﬂax distribution measured simultaneously at 3 diﬂerent depths of the phantom, LET spectrum,
and estimation of the radiation quality factor Q(L), as deﬁned by the International Commission on Radiological
Protection publication 60 (ICRP, 1991).
