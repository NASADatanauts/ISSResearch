Abstract: The experiment SPORES ‘Spores in artiﬁcial meteorites’ was part of European Space Agency’s
EXPOSE-R mission, which exposed chemical and biological samples for nearly 2 years (March 10, 2009
to February 21, 2011) to outer space, when attached to the outside of the Russian Zvezda module of the
International Space Station. The overall objective of the SPORES experiment was to address the question
whether the meteorite material offers enough protection against the harsh environment of space for spores
to survive a long-term journey in space by experimentally mimicking the hypothetical scenario of
Lithopanspermia, which assumes interplanetary transfer of life Via impact-ejected rocks. For this purpose,
spores of Bacillus subtilis 168 were exposed to selected parameters of outer space (solar ultraviolet (UV)
radiation at 2> 110 or >200 nni, space vacuum, galactic cosmic radiation and temperature ﬂuctuations)
either as a pure spore monolayer or mixed with different concentrations of artiﬁcial meteorite powder. Total
ﬂuence of solar UV radiation (100—400 nm) during the mission was 859 M] m‘ 2. After retrieval the Viability
of the samples was analysed. A Mission Ground Reference program was performed in parallel to the ﬂight
experiment. The results of SPORES demonstrate the high inactivating potential of extraterrestrial UV
radiation as one of the most harmful factors of space, especially UV at 2> 110 nm. The UV-induced
inactivation is mainly caused by photodamaging of the DNA, as documented by the identiﬁcation of the
spore photoproduct 5,6-dihydro-5(a-thyniinyl)thyn1ine. The data disclose the limits of Lithopanspermia
for spores located in the upper layers of impact-ejected rocks due to access of harmful extraterrestrial
solar UV radiation.
