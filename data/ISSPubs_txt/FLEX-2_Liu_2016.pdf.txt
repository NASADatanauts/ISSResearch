disappeared indicating an extinction mechanism that was speculated to be due to radiative losses from
the ﬂame. Concurrently. measurements of wideband radiation dropped signiﬁcantly and the burning rate
gradually approached pure evaporation.
In some instances for n-heptane and n-octane radiative extinction was accompanied by droplet evap-
oration rates that were signiﬁcantly higher than evaporation in a hot ambiance which persisted for a
signiﬁcant fraction of the burning history before decreasing to evaporation in a cold ambience. An energy
balance on the drop related the ﬂame temperature to droplet diameter from which it was predicted that
ﬂame temperatures after ignition were greater than 1200 K before dropping to under approximately 800 K
and remaining constant thereafter until eventually reaching near ambient conditions. This intermediate
regime of burning was conjectured to be associated with a low temperature combustion process. The
transition to this intermediate regime upon radiative extinction was occasionally accompanied by ﬂame
oscillations. the origin of which was uncertain but could have been initiated by motion of the droplet
owing to the deployment process.
