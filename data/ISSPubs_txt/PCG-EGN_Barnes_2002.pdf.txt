formed in the tubes. Nonetheless, crystals were grown.

if the difference in diffraction limit arises from factors other :
than crystal size. Improvements in temperature control and I
the elimination of air gaps are needed, but the results show
that the EGN on the 188 can be used to produce space-grown
crystals that diffract to high resolution. '
1. Introduction
During the assembly of the International Space Station (ISS), ‘
NASA’s biological crystal-growth program is switching from
, an emphasis on using the Space Shuttle Orbiter to an emphasis -
. on using the ISS. The primary advantages of the 188 are that it ‘
» provides the opportunity for longer periods of weightlessness g
» (1—3 months on 188 versus 1—2 weeks on the Orbiter) and '
* dedicated facilities that can be used regularly. This paper ;
reports results from the ﬁrst biological crystal-growth experi- ‘
, ment on the ISS.
In the period 1985—2000, NASA ﬂew 45 biological crystal- I
growth missions in space, primarily on the Space Shuttle
Orbiter. About 35% of the proteins, nucleic acids and viruses
. that ﬂew more than once produced crystals with better '-
diffraction limits than any previously terrestrially grown
crystal (Kundrot et al., 2001). Only ﬁve of the 45 missions were
’ dedicated to conducting microgravity experiments. Most of
. . the missions had a primary purpose that was detrimental for
5 growing crystals in a low-acceleration environment, e.g.
“ launching satellites from the Orbiter cargo bay.
» Eight missions delivered experiments to the Russian space
station Mir.
Two crystallization methods were developed for the Mir

nt precipitant interface. The protein diffusion into the precipitant is assumed to be negligible. The gray arrows depict the case where protein remains in
of solution. The trajectory begins at zero precipitant concentration (point a) and rises to essentially undiluted initial precipitant concentration (point e). As
a the precipitant continues to diffuse into the protein region, the precipitant concentration drops until it reaches 1 x precipitant concentration (point d). If J
.te the protein is also allowed to redistribute throughout the tube (e.g. over a long time scale or with active mixing), the trajectory reaches the same point as .
:in the ﬁnal vapor—diffusion experiment (point e). The black arrows show the trajectory taken when protein crystallization/precipitation occurs. The .
ry trajectory begins as before at point a and as the precipitant concentration increases the protein eventually crystallizes or precipitates (point b). As the
m concentration of precipitant climbs, the trajectory moves along the solubility curve, passes through the ﬁnal equilibration point and reaches 2x
ed precipitant concentration (point c'). Lastly, as the precipitant solution is diluted into the protein region, the trajectory retraces the solubility curve to
its arrive at the ﬁnal equilibrium point (point (1’). Positions in the tube that are further removed from the protein-precipitant interface will have similar
trajectories but the overshoot beyond 1 x precipitant concentration will be less.
