Abstract
Understanding the effects of spaceflight on microbial communities is crucial for the success of Iong-term, manned space
missions. Surface-associated bacterial communities, known as biofilms, were abundant on the Mir space station and
continue to be a challenge on the International Space Station. The health and safety hazards linked to the development of
biofilms are of particular concern due to the suppression of immune function observed during spaceflight. While planktonic
cultures of microbes have indicated that spaceflight can lead to increases in growth and virulence, the effects of spaceflight
on biofilm development and physiology remain unclear. To address this issue, Pseudomonas aeruginosa was cultured during
two Space Shuttle Atlantis missions: STS-132 and STS-135, and the biofilms formed during spaceflight were characterized.
Spaceflight was observed to increase the number of viable cells, biofilm biomass, and thickness relative to normal gravity
controls. Moreover, the biofilms formed during spaceflight exhibited a column-and-canopy structure that has not been
observed on Earth. The increase in the amount of biofilms and the formation of the novel architecture during spaceflight
were observed to be independent of carbon source and phosphate concentrations in the media. However, flageIIa—driven
motility was shown to be essential for the formation of this biofilm architecture during spaceflight. These findings represent
the first evidence that spaceflight affects community—Ievel behaviors of bacteria and highlight the importance of
understanding how both harmful and beneficial human-microbe interactions may be altered during spaceflight.
