0 Premise 0f the study: Plants will be an important component of advanced life support systems during space exploration mis—
sions. Therefore, understanding their biology in the spacecraft environment will be essential before they can be used for such
systems.

0 Methods: Seedlings of Arabidopsis thaliana were grown for 2 wk in the Biological Research in Canisters (BRIC) hardware on
board the second to the last mission of the space shuttle Discovery (STS—131). Transcript proﬁles between ground controls and
space—grown seedlings were compared using stringent selection criteria.

0 Key results: Expression of transcripts associated with oxidative stress and cell wa11remode1ing was repressed in microgravity.
These downregulated genes were previously shown to be enriched in root hairs consistent with seedling phenotypes observed
in space. Mutations in genes that were downregulated in microgravity, including two uncharacterized root hair—eXpressed Class
III peroxidase genes (PRX44 and PRXSﬂ, led to defective polar root hair growth on Earth. PRX44 and PRX5 7 mutants had
ruptured root hairs, which is a typical phenotype of tip—growing cells with defective cell walls and those subjected to stress.

0 Conclusions: Long—term exposure to microgravity negatively impacts tip growth by repressing expression of genes essential
for normal root hair development. Whereas Changes in peroxidase gene expression leading to reduced root hair growth in space
are actin—independent, root hair development modulated by phosphoinositides could be dependent on the actin cytoskeleton.
These results have profound implications for plant adaptation to microgravity given the importance of tip growing cells such
as root hairs for efﬁcient nutrient capture.
