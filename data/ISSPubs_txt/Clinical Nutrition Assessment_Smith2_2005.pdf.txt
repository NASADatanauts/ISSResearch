ABSTRACT: Bone loss is a current limitation for long-term space exploration. Bone markers, calcitropic
hormones, and calcium kinetics of crew members on space missions of 4—6 months were evaluated. Space-
ﬂight-induced bone loss was associated with increased bone resorption and decreased calcium absorption.
Introduction: Bone loss is a significant concern for the health of astronauts on long-duration missions. De-
fining the time course and mechanism of these Changes will aid in developing means to counteract these losses
during space ﬂight and will have relevance for other Clinical situations that impair weight-bearing activity.
Materials and Methods: We report here results from two studies conducted during the Shuttle—Mir Science
Program. Study 1 was an evaluation of bone and calcium biochemical markers of 13 subjects before and after
long-duration (4—6 months) space missions. In study 2, stable calcium isotopes were used to evaluate calcium
metabolism in siX subjects before, during, and after ﬂight. Relationships between measures of bone turnover,
biochemical markers, and calcium kinetics were examined.
Results: Pre— and postﬂight study results confirmed that, after landing, bone resorption was increased, as
indicated by increases in urinary calcium (p < 0.05) and collagen cross—links (N-telopeptide, pyridinoline, and
deoxypyridinoline were all increased >55% above preﬂight levels, p < 0.001). Parathyroid hormone and
Vitamin D metabolites were unchanged at landing. Biochemical markers of bone formation were unchanged
at landing, but 2—3 weeks later, both bone-speciﬂc alkaline phosphatase and osteocalcin were significantly
(p < 0.01) increased above preﬂight levels. In studies conducted during ﬂight, bone resorption markers were
also significantly higher than before ﬂight. The calcium kinetic data also validated that bone resorption was
increased during ﬂight compared with preﬂight values (668 i 130 versus 427 i 153 mg/day; p < 0.001) and
Clearly documented that true intestinal calcium absorption was significantly lower during ﬂight compared with
preﬂight values (233 i 87 versus 460 i 47 mg/day; p < 0.01). Weightlessness had a detrimental effect on the
balance in bone turnover such that the daily difference in calcium retention during ﬂight compared with
preﬂight values approached 300 mg/day (—234 i 102 versus 63 i 75 mg/day; p < 0.01).
Conclusions: These bone marker and calcium kinetic studies indicated that the bone loss that occurs during
space ﬂight is a consequence of increased bone resorption and decreased intestinal calcium absorption.

Subjects 1—3 completed only one session before ﬂight; for subjects 4—6, the one session closest to ﬂight was used.

Subjects 4—6 are represented by data from a previous publication (7).

Data from the two in-ﬂight sessions are provided where available, but statistical analyses revealed no differences between the sessions, so they were
combined for further statistical analysis. To protect subject confidentiality, individual postﬂight data (11 = 5) are not shown. The postﬂight data are from
tracer administrations on R + 0 days (11 = 3) and R + 3 (n = 2). Details of other missing data-points are included in the Results section. No data were
removed; all of the missing points represent sessions not performed.

Six subjects participated in this study; however, because of analytical and individual subject data collection issues, the number of subject data-points
varied among analytes and between time-points. See Statistical analyses for details of how this was handled.

Midmolecule PTH data were available for only three subjects and were not available early in ﬂight or after the initial postﬂight studies.

Early in-ﬂight data were collected after 14 days of ﬂight; late in-ﬂight data were collected after 60—110 days of ﬂight.
