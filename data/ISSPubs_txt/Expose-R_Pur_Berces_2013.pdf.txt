Abstract
The biological dosimetry of the solar UV radiation functioned correctly on the Earth’s surface. The aim of the
present studies was to extend the dosimetry to the extraterrestrial solar radiation in LEO. Similar to the Earth’s
surface bacteriophage T7 and polycrystalline uracil thin layers were used as detectors and exposed to the simulated
and to the real space environmental parameters aiming to perform the in situ biological UV dosimetry in the space,
more exactly on the external pallet of the ISS. The UV detectors have been used in specific cases in thin layer form. In
contrast to the Earth’s surface the extraterrestrial solar UV radiations contains wavelength components (A ~ 190-200
nm), which cause photolesions (photoproducts) in the nucleic acids/their components similar to the UV—B photons.
However, these wavelengths cause not only photolesions but with a wavelength-dependent efficiency the reversion
of some photolesion, too. Our biological detectors measured either in simulation or in situ conditions the resultant
of both reactions induced by the extraterrestrial UV radiation. From this aspect the role of the photoreversion in the
extension of the biological UV dosimetry and in the survival of the living systems in the space are discussed.
Keywords; Photoreversion; Extraterrestrial UV climate; UV a constituent of the RNA have been used. RGB joined the scientiﬁc
dosimetry in the space consortium ROSE (Response of Organisms to the Space Environment)
with the experiment Phage and Uracil Response, PUR [5,13].
