BACKGROUND: The aim of this investigation into the performance and reliability of Russian cosmonauts in hand-controlled docking of a

spacecraft on a space station (experiment PILOT) was to enhance overall mission safety and crew training efﬁciency. The
preliminary ﬁndings on the Mir space station suggested that a break in docking training of about 90 d signiﬁcantly
degraded performance.

METHODS: Intensiﬁed experiment schedules on the International Space Station (ISS) have allowed for a monthly experiment using
an on-board simulator.Therefore, instead ofjust three training tasks as on Mir, ﬁve training ﬂights per session have been
implemented on the |SS.This experiment was run in parallel but independently of the operational docking training the
cosmonauts receive.

RESULTS: First, performance was compared between the experiments on the two space stations by nonparametric testing.
Performance differed signiﬁcantly between space stations preﬂight, in ﬂight, and postﬂight. Second, performance was
analyzed by modeling the linear mixed effects of all variances (LME).The ﬁxed factors space station, mission phases,
training task numbers, and their interaction were analyzed. Cosmonauts were designated as a random factor. All ﬁxed
factors were found to be signiﬁcant and the interaction between stations and mission phase was also signiﬁcant.

DISCUSSION: In summary, performance on the ISS was shown to be signiﬁcantly improved, thus enhancing mission safety. Additional
approaches to docking performance assessment and prognosis are presented and discussed.
