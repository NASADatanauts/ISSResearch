A fundamental phenotypic trait in Drosophila melanogaster is the speed of movement. Its quantiﬁcation in response _‘£
to environmental and experimental factors is highly useful for behavioral and neurological studies. Quantifying this '0
behavioral characteristic in freely moving ﬂies is difﬁcult, and many current systems are limited to evaluating the speed of _|_,
movement ofone ﬂy at a time or rely on expensive, time-consuming methods. Here, we present a novel signal processing 0
method of quantifying the speed of multiple ﬂies using a system with automatic behavior detection and analysis that C
we previously developed to quantify general activity. By evaluating the shape of the signal wave from recordings of a
live and simulated single ﬂy, a metric for speed of movement was found. The feasibility of using this metric to estimate 0
the speed of movement in a population of ﬂies was then conﬁrmed by evaluating recordings taken from populations D
ofﬂies maintained at two different temperatures. The results were consistent with those reported in the literature. This .
