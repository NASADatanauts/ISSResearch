A comprehensive exploration of regional dust evacuation in complex plasma crystals is presented. Voids created
in three-dimensional crystals on the International Space Station have provided a rich foundation for experiments,
but cavities in dust crystals formed in ground-based experiments have not received as much attention. Inside a
modiﬁed Gaseous Electronics Conference rf cell, a powered vertical probe was used to clear the central area of
a dust crystal, producing a caVity with high cylindrical symmetry. Cavities generated by three mechanisms are
examined. First, repulsion of micrometer-sized particles by a negatively charged probe is investigated. A model
of this effect developed for a dc plasma is modiﬁed and applied to eXplain experimental data in if plasma.
Second, the formation of natural cavities is surveyed; a radial ion drag proposed to occur due to a curved sheath
is considered in conjunction with thermophoresis and a ﬂattened conﬁnement potential above the center of the
electrode. Finally, caVity formation upon increasing the probe potential above the plasma ﬂoating potential is
justiﬁed by a combination of ion drag and sheath edge modiﬁcation. The cavities produced by these methods
appear similar, but each is shown to be facilitated by fundamentally different processes.
