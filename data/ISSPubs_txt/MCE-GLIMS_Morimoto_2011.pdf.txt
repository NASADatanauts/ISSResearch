: JEM-GLIMS mission, very high frequency (VHF) broadband digital InTerFerometer (VITF). VITF consists of a pair of VHF
broadband antennas and electronics to record EM waveforms from lightning discharges. It is designed to estimate the
direction-of—arrival With about 10 km resolution that is equivalent to the scale of a thundercloud. It means that VITF is able to
monitor thunderclouds with lightning activities globally. Comprehensive observations with the optical payloads 0f JEM-GLIMS
mission for lightning activities and related transient luminous events (TLEs) are expected to give us many scientific impacts to
the ﬁeld. The developments ofVITF are based on the heritage of VHF sensor on Maido-l satellite.
