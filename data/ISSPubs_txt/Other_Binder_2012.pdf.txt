Abstract — The dendrite growth velocity during non—equilibrium solidiﬁcation of tetragonal NigB
crystals is measured as a function of undercooling 0n electrostatically levitated droplets. High—
speed Video imaging is applied to measure in situ the propagation of the solid—liquid interface
apparent on the sample surface. To analyze the raw data, a three—dimensional model is developed to
determine the growth velocity Within the volume of the melt. Microstructure analysis is performed
to resolve the pattern formation mechanism of tetragonal NigB crystals Which differs signiﬁcantly
from the cubic case. The dendrite tips are found to grow perpendicular to the crystallographic
{111} planes. As a consequence, the propagation of the solidiﬁcation front on a macroscopic scale
is determined by the lattice parameters of the tetragonal crystal structure. The dendrite growth
velocities along the {111} normal directions are analyzed on a mesoscopic scale Within a sharp—
interface model.
