images (b), (c), (d), (e), (f), (g) and (h) are single band images at wavelengths of 0.502, 0.600, 0.860, 0.903, 0.955, 1.001 and 1.035 micron, respectively.
Spatial features of shallow water are clearly seen in the left half images, such as in Fig. 1a, 1b and 10. The black parts in the right half images are the
deepwater regions. The white spots in the images are clouds. Image from 1e t0 1h show the second order effects of the shallow water in the near IR
