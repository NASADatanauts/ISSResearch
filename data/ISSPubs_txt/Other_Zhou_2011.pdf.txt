Abstract
Primordial germ cells (PGCs), precursors of germline cells, display a variety of antigens during their migration to target gonads. Here,
we used silk chicken offspring (Gallus gallus domesticus) embryos subjected to space microgravity to investigate the inﬂuence of micro—
graVity on PGCs. The ShenZhou—3 unmanned spaceship carried nine fertilized silk chicken eggs, named the ﬂight group, returned to Earth
after 7 days space ﬂight. And the control group has the same Clan with the ﬂight group. PGCs from ﬂight and control group silk chicken
offspring embryos were examined during migration by using two antibodies (2C9 and anti—SSEA—l), in combination with the horseradish
peroxidase detection system, and using periodic acid—Schiﬂ’s solution (PAS) reaction. After incubation for about 30 h, SSEA—l and 2C9
positive cells were detected in the germinal crescent of ﬂight and control group silk chicken offspring embryos. After incubation of eggs for
2—2.5 days, SSEA—l and 2C9 positive cells were detected in embryonic blood vessels of ﬂight and control group silk chicken offspring
embryos. After incubation of eggs for 5.5 days, PGCs in the dorsal mesentery and gonad could also be identiﬁed in ﬂight and control
group silk chicken offspring embryos by using SSEA—l and 2C9 antibodies. Based on location and PAS staining, these cells were identiﬁed
as PGCs. Meanwhile, at the stage of PGCs migration and then becoming established in the germinal ridges, no difference in SSEA-l or
2C9 staining was detected between female and male PGCs in ﬂight and control group silk chicken offspring embryos. Although there were
differences in the proﬁles of PGC concentration between male and female embryos during the special circulating stage, changing proﬁle of
PGCs concentration was similar in same seX between ﬂight and control group offspring embryos. We concluded that there is little effect on
PGCs in offspring embryos of microgravity—treated chicken and that PGC development appears to be normal.
