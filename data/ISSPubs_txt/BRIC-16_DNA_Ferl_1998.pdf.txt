We are investigating the nature of plant genome domain organization by using DNase I- and topoisomerase JI-medi-
ated cleavage to produce domains reflecting higher order chromatin structures. Limited digestion of nuclei with DNase
Iresults in the conversion of the >800 kb genomic DNA to an accumulation of fragments that represents a collection of
individual domains of the genome created by preferential cleavage at super—hypersensitive regions. The median size of
these fragments is rv45 kb in maize and rv25 kb in Arabidopsis. Hybridization analyses with specific gene probes re-
vealed that individual genes occupy discrete domains within the distribution created by DNase I. The maize alcohol
dehydrogenase Adh1 gene occupies a domain of 90 kb, and the maize general regulatory factor GRF1 gene occupies a
domain of 100 kb in length. Arabidopsis Adh was found within two distinct domains of 8.3 and 6.1 kb, whereas an Arabi-
dopsis GRF gene occupies a single domain of 27 kb. The domains created by topoisomerase JI-mediated cleavage are
identical in size to those created by DNase I. These results imply that the genome is not packaged by means of a ran-
dom gathering of the genome into domains of indiscriminate length but rather that the genome is gathered into specific
domains and that a gene consistently occupies a discrete physical section of the genome. Our proposed model is that
these large organizational domains represent the fundamental structural loop domains created by attachment of chro-
matin to the nuclear matrix at loop basements. These loop domains may be distinct from the domains created by the
matrix attachment regions that typically flank smaller, often functionally distinct sections of the genome.

chromatin analyses (e.g., Paul et a|., 1987); however, two
obstacles exist for conducting naked DNA control digests
for these experiments. First, conventional methods fragment
genomic DNA, making intact DNA of megabase size essen-
tially impossible to isolate. Second, although it is possible to
prepare agarose-embedded high molecular weight genomic
145 kb DNA (deproteinated embedded nuclei), some structural fea-
tures of the genome that are imposed by nuclear proteins
97 (e.g., bends, kinks, and nicks) may be retained and may
possibly continue to influence the effects of nucleases on
48.5 sensitive areas of the genome.
These problems were addressed by two different naked

be widely explored in other systems.
Much of the evidence contributing to the hypothesis that

A — , i 4 Razin’s group has referred to attachment regions that serve
EH S2“? to anchor sections of the genome into organizational loops
Z,“ 5545, _ as loop basements to distinguish them from MARs defined
in the classic sense (Razin ancl Gromova, 1995; Razin,
1996). We have adopted this nomenclature and refer to the
DNA sites that have been functionally defined by in vivo
DNase Iand VM 26 cleavage as loop basement attachment
regions or LBARs.
The current data from maize and Arabidopsis provide an
, opportunity to draw conclusions about higher order chro-
matin structure in plants in three areas: the contribution of
looped domains in the global packaging of the genome,
the domain loop size distribution among plants, and the
. gene distribution among individual loops. The first issue is
. - addressed by the pattern of DNase I—mediated cleavage

A‘ EmB' — tive sites, such as those in gene promoter regions that are
not resolved under the conditions used in these experi-
ments (Paul et a|., 1987). An alternative explanation is that
i the loop basements are physically exposed to the exoge-
nous nuclease prior to the nuclease accessing other re-
\ gions of the genome. The latter explanation is consonant
with the “channels model” of nuclear matrix structure. In
this model, the nuclear matrix is contiguous with the nu-
clear pore, ancl interphase chromosomes are arranged in
‘ loops attached to the outer surface of channels formed
‘ ‘ from matrix material invaginated from the pore (Razin and
