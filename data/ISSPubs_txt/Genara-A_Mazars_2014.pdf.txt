Abstract
The ”GENARA A” experiment was designed to monitor global changes in the proteome of membranes of Arabidopsis
thaliana seedlings subjected to microgravity on board the International Space Station (ISS). For this purpose, 12-day-old
seedlings were grown either in space, in the European Modular Cultivation System (EMCS) under microgravity or on a 1 g
centrifuge, or on the ground. Proteins associated to membranes were selectively extracted from microsomes and identified
and quantified through LC-MS-MS using a labeI-free method. Among the 1484 proteins identified and quantified in the 3
conditions mentioned above, 80 membrane-associated proteins were significantly more abundant in seedlings grown
under microgravity in space than under 1 9 (space and ground) and 69 were less abundant. Clustering of these proteins
according to their predicted function indicates that proteins associated to auxin metabolism and trafficking were depleted
in the microsomal fraction in ug space conditions, whereas proteins associated to stress responses, defence and metabolism
were more abundant in ug than in 1 9 indicating that microgravity is perceived by plants as a stressful environment. These
results clearly indicate that a global membrane proteomics approach gives a snapshot of the cell status and its signaling
activity in response to microgravity and highlight the major processes affected.

replicates (Fig. 84A). As expected, higher variability was observed
between samples 0 g and l g from the space experiment (Fig.
$413). The histogram of the log-ratios showed a centered and A
symmetrical bell-shape distribution (Fig. S5). Q—Q plots revealed
that the distribution of log-ratios was closer to a Laplace
distribution than to a normal distribution (Fig. S6). Therefore,
using the R package VGAM [48], a Laplace distribution was ﬁtted
to the log-ratio distribution in control samples and then used to
calculate p-Values, i.e. probabilities that l g/ 0 g ratios observed in
the space experiment were due to chance rather than to gravity
effects (Fig. S7). In order to control the false discovery rate in the
lists of selected proteins, a Benjamini & Hocheberg correction was
applied to the p-Values using the Multitest R-package [49]. A
protein was considered as signiﬁcantly over- or under-represented
in one condition compared to another when the corrected p-Value
associated to the corresponding ratio was lower than 0.05.

that most of the Arabidopsis seeds germinated correctly with a
germination rate close to 100% and gave seedlings that apparently
grew similarly whatever the gravity conditions (data not shown).
This apparent homogeneity in the biomass production of plants
