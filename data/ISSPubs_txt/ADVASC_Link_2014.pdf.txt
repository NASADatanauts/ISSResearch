Seed-to-Seed-to-Seed Growth and Development
of ArabidopSIs In MicrograVIty
Bruce M. Link,1 James S. Busse,2 and Bratislav Stankovic3
Abstract
Arabidopsis thaliana was grown from seed to seed wholly in microgravity on the International Space Station.
Arabidopsis plants were germinated, grown, and maintained inside a growth chamber prior to returning to
Earth. Some of these seeds were used in a subsequent experiment to successfully produce a second (back—to—
back) generation of microgravity—grown Arabidopsis. In general, plant growth and development in microgravity
proceeded similarly to those of the ground controls, which were grown in an identical chamber. Morpholo—
gically, the most striking feature of space—grown Arabidopsis was that the secondary inﬂorescence branches and
siliques formed nearly perpendicular angles to the inﬂorescence stems. The branches grew out perpendicularly
to the main inﬂorescence stem, indicating that gravity was the key determinant of branch and silique angle and
that light had either no role or a secondary role in Arabidopsis branch and silique orientation. Seed protein
bodies were 55% smaller in space seed than in controls, but protein assays showed only a 9% reduction in seed
protein content. Germination rates for space—produced seed were 92%, indicating that the seeds developed
in microgravity were healthy and Viable. Gravity is not necessary for seed—to—seed growth of plants, though
it plays a direct role in plant form and may inﬂuence seed reserves. Key Words: Arabidopsis—Branch—
Inﬂorescence—Microgravity—Morphology—Seed—Space. Astrobiology 14, 866—875.
