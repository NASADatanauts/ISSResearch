1. Current status on microgravity experiments in J apan

J apan has been operating ‘KIBO’ as J apanese eXpe rimental module on 188 to perform researches on
physical, life, medical, sp ace sci ences in space. Several r esearch racks an (1 facilities have been
accommodated in the pres surized module of ‘KIB 0’ (see ﬁgur e 1) and res earches 0n Marangoni
convection, ice crystals have already been carried out.

J apan currently has 17 188 ﬂight projects (including 4 candidates) and 25 research WGs in the ﬁeld
of physical sciences. A res earch aiming at ISS/KIBO experiment has to follow a process step by step
(see ﬁgure 2 ). Activities in research WGs annuall y solicited are the ﬁrst st ep 0f the process. A
research WG discusses new ideas and develops a ﬂ ight pr oposal t0 subm it it to a future ﬂ ight AO
(Announcement of Opp ortunity) to be released on biannual basi s. Som e research WGs might try
BBM (Bread Board Model) tests including parabolic ﬂight experiments to assess feasibilities of their
observations and operations and verify the validities of their science requirements, if necessary . A
research, aft er passing a ﬂ ight AO, Will try science deﬁnitions as a ﬂight can didate for a couple of
years and has to pass the proj ect deﬁnition review to step up to a ﬂight project.

2. Current status on researches in physical chemistry in Japan
There are 1 ﬂight candidate and 4 research WGs (2 WGs + 2 RTs) in the ﬁeld of physical chemistry.
Current status on those Will be described in this secession.
2.1. Flight projects
A research proposal on colloid physics was selected as a candidate of KIBO experiments in 2010 and
has been doing phaseA studies.
2.1.]. Structure analysis on colloid crystals with a laser diffractometer and researches on particle
interactions. The research team organized by Ikuo Sogami is interested in interactions in charged
colloid dispersions. Crystal formations in those dispersions Which occur When the salt concentrations
are decreased were normally explained by DLVO (Derjaguin and Landau, Verwey and Overbeek)
theory, but some observations like measurements of lattice spacing of the crystals [1][2], observation
of gas-liquid coexistence state in colloid dispersions [3][4], and observation of void formations in
colloid dispersions[5]—[7] can not be explained by DLVO theory and suggest existence of long range
attractive interaction. The research team has been developing 188 research facility to be
accommodated in Multi-purpose small payload rack (see ﬁgure 1). CCD (Charge Coupled Device)
camera of the facility, haVing several obj eetive lenses, can observe void formation and its dynamics as
well as Whole image of a cell. The key element of the facility is ‘Kikuehi-Kossel’ laser diffractometer
developed by the team [8][9]. Although this is simpler and more compact than small angle X-ray
diffractometer, it can precisely measure crystal structures and lattice spacing (see ﬁgure 3). This Will
be only one facility that enables such precise measurements of crystal structures on colloids on 188.
The members of the project are Ikuo Sogami (Kyoto Sangyo University), Masayuki Tanigawa (Kyoto
Sangyo University), Tsuyoshi Yosiyama (Kyoto Sangyo University), Yuj i Ikeda (Kyoto Sangyo
University), Tadatomi Shinohara (Kyoto Sangyo University), Masamiehi Ishikawa (RIKEN), Kensaku
Itoh (University of Toyama), Junpei Yamanaka (Nagoya City University), Hideo Oka (Tayea
Corporation), Mitsuhiro Matsumoto (Kyoto University), B. V. R. Tata (Indira Gandhi Centre for
Atomic Research), and Naokiyo Koshikawa (J AXA).

2.2. Research WGs
The research WGs are categorized into RTs (Research Teams) and WGs (see ﬁgure 2). The former is
one for new comers to discuss their preli minary ideas and the latter is one for m ore exp erienced
members to deﬁne experimental requirements and res earch plans. In addition to team meetings, WGs
carry out BBM tests to clarify the validity of th eir experiment techniques and requirem ents. 80111 e
WGs might perform parabolic ﬂight experiments, if necessary. 2 WGs and 2 RTs are currently active
in the ﬁeld of physical chemistry.
2.2.1. Mesoscopic chemistry under microgravity WG. The WG coordinated by Kaoru Tsujii is aiming
at incubating new ideas associated With chemistry and various ideas proposed by various members
have been discussed.
(1) Honey comb ﬁlm formation under microgravity. A member of the WG, Masatsugu Shimomura,
found that dissipative structures Where pores having a uniform diameter are regularly ordered can be
obtained if steam is added to casted polymer solutions [10][11]. Although the protocol is very simple,
the uniformity and ordering of the pores are quite well (see ﬁgure 4). Medical applications have been
investigated and larger ﬁlms are desired for the applications, but a kind of domain formation like a
grain boundary for a polycrystalline is observed in some cases. The members speculated that this
might arise from natural convections due to gravity and carried out hyper gravity experiments With a
centrifuge [12] and has tried low gravity experiments With parabolic ﬂights. The members of the
group are Kaoru Tsujii (Hokkaido University (retired)), Masamichi Ishikawa (RIKEN), Masato Sane
(Yamagata University), Masatsugu Shimomura (Tohoku University), Hiroshi Yabu (Tohoku
University), Yuji Hirai (Tohoku University), Kenichi Yoshikawa (Kyoto University), Nobuyuki
Magome (Kyoto University), Takashi Mashiko (Shizuoka University), and Makoto Natsuisaka
(JAXA).

2.2.2. Chemicalprocesses in critical densilyﬂuctuation WG. The WG organized by Shigeru Deguchi
has been discussing two maj or topics described below. The systems and phenomena on the both
topics are fully different, but the WG is considering that density ﬂuctuations in Vicinity of critical
points play an important role on the both phenomena. The members of the group are Shigeru Deguehi
(J AMSTEC), Masamiehi Ishikawa (RIKEN), Yoshihisa Inoue (Osaka University), Kaoru Tsujii
(Hokkaido University (retired)), Makoto Natsuisaka (J AXA), Keiko Nishiyama (Chiba University),
Yasuhiro Nishiyama (NAIST), Toru Maekawa (Toyo University), Takeshi Morita (Chiba University),
Sadaatsu Mukai (Kyushu University), and Takehiko Wada (Tohoku University).
(1) Colloid dynamics in the vicinity ofcriticalpoints. Shigeru Deguchi etc. found that silica particles
dispersed in super critical water take a distance longer than Coulomb's interaction predicts. Since the
observation was made on ground, the particles were precipitated onto the base plate and the
phenomena were restricted in two dimension. The team has proposed microgravity experiments to be
free from such constraint and enable more precise observations.
(2) Chiral Chemical reactions in near— and super- critical C02 A member of the WG, Yoshihisa
Inoue, revealed that photosensitized enantiodifferentiations (see ﬁgure 5) would occur in various
systems and under various conditions. In particular, he found that it would be enhanced if the
reactions were given in super critical carbon dioxide (see ﬁgure 6) [13]. The research team expects
that this might be more emphasized under microgravity and has proposed microgravity experiments.
The team has tried parabolic ﬂight experiments by developing a very compact and automatic super
critical reaction chambers.

2.2.3. Exploration ofemulsion stability under microgravity RT. The RT organized by Kazutami
Sakamoto is aiming at observation of emulsion formation and its stability under microgravity. This
would promisingly help understand the basic mechanisms of emulsiﬁoation and stabilization. The
outcome of this trial would bring better designing and quality assurance of emulsion products as
dispersed oolloidal system, which are indispensable for household and institutional applications. The
team found a long-term stable emulsion system with new amphiphilio material through a basic
research [14] and believes that this could contribute to researches in the ﬁeld. The team has started to
communicate with one of the European topical teams, PASTA (Particle Stabilized Emulsions and
Foams). The members of the team are Kazutami Sakamoto (Chiba Institute of Science), Hideki Sakai
(Tokyo University of Science), Keniohi Sakai (Tokyo University of Science), and Makoto Natsuisaka
(JAXA).
2.2.4. Impressionistic physics ofbubbles, drops and foams under microgravity RT. The RT organized
by K0 Okumura studies the dynamics of bubbles, drops and foams under microgravity, Via
impressionistic physics which is a powerful tool to ﬁnd out simple laws from complex phenomena. Ko
Okumura has started to attract considerable attention in the ﬁeld through experiments performed with
the Hele-Shaw cell (a quasi two-dimensional cell) [15][16] so that he has been inVited to j oin a
number of topical teams of BSA; FOAM-C, PolarDrop and DOLFINE. The members of the team are
Ko Okumura (Oohanomizu University), Yumiko Yoshitake (Tokyo Denki University), and Makoto
Natsuisaka (J AXA).
3. Conclusions
There are 1 ﬂight candidate and 3 resea roh WGs in th e ﬁeld of phy sioal chemistry in J apan. They all
welcome communication with and/or participation of researchers of international communities.
