|<u|euven.be (1—2 weeks) on respiratory-mediated cardiovascular rhythms in ﬁve cosmo-
nauts. Two paced-breathing protocols at 6 and 12 breaths Inin_1 were per—
formed in the standing and supine positions before spaceﬂight, and after 1
and 25 days upon return. Dynamic baroreﬂeX function was evaluated by
transfer function analysis between systolic pressure and the RR intervals.
Results: Post-ﬂight orthostatic blood pressure control was preserved in all
cosmonauts. In the standing position after spaceﬂight there was an increase
in heart rate (HR) of approx. 20 beats min‘1 or more. Averaged for all ﬁve
cosmonauts, respiratory sinus dysrhythmia and transfer gain reduced to 40%
the day after landing, and had returned to pre-ﬂight levels after 25 days.
Low-frequency gain decreased from 6.6 (3.4) [mean (SD)] pre-ﬂight to 3.9
(1.6) post-ﬂight and returned to 5.7 (1.3) ms mmHg_1 after 25 days upon
return to Earth. Unlike alterations in the modulation of HR, blood pressure
dynamics were not signiﬁcantly different between pre- and post-ﬂight ses-
sions.
Conclusion: Our results indicate that short-duration spaceﬂight reduces
respiratory modulation of HR and decreases cardiac baroreﬂeX gain without
affecting post-ﬂight arterial blood pressure dynamics. Altered respiratory
modulation of human autonomic rhythms does not persist until 25 days
upon return to Earth.

normal paced—breathing protocols. In addition, the gain and delay are also presented from spontaneous low—frequency rhythms
