The laboratory of Microbiology at SCK-CEN, in collaboration with different universities, participates in several ESA 8T
programmes with bacterial experiments that are carried out in the International Space Station (ISS). The main objective i
of these programmes is to study the effects of space ﬂight conditions such as microgravity and cosmic radiation on the general :p
behaviour of model bacteria. To measure the radiation doses received by the bacteria, different detectors accompanied the g
microbiological experiments. The results obtained during two space ﬂight missions are discussed. This dosimetry experiment E
was a collaboration between different institutes so that the doses could be estimated by different techniques. For measurement {3

part of the spectrum was measured by three types of thermoluminescent detectors (7LinMg,Ti; 7LiF:Mg,Cu,P; A1203zC) and 9
by the optically stimulated luminescence technique using A1203:C detectors. a
