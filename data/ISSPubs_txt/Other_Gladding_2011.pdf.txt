Background: The impact of Iong-term microgravity on cardiovascular function may become a critical limitation to human space exploration.
Myocardial strain analysis and mathematical cardiac modeling could be used as a predictive tool for cardiac dysfunction in space. We aimed to
compare strain data from the HDI-5000 ultrasound imaging platform, identical to the system aboard the International Space Station (ISS), with
standard echocardiographic platforms on earth.
Methods: 10 patients with cardiomyopathy underwent echocardiography with a GE Vivid 7 and Philips HDI5000. EchoPAC strain analysis was
applied to the GE data, while two universal strain software programs,Ve|ocity Vector Imaging v3.0 (WI) (Siemens Corp) and Echolnsight v1.0 (Epsilon
Imaging, USA), were applied to raster versions of both sets of images. HDI5000 raster—based strain was compared with parallel strain data. Strain
data were analyzed on a global and regional basis and used to render a model of an astronaut’s heart (Figure 1).
Results: Global strain analyzed with the Vivid 7 and EchoPAC correlated with universal software systems; WI r = 0.92, CI 0.83 to 0.96, p <0.0001
and Echolnsight r = 0.84, CI 0.48 to 0.95, p = 0.001. Global strain for the same patients on the HDI5000 was also comparable r = 0.69, CI 0.33 to
0.88, p 0.002.
Conclusions: Raster—based, speckle tracking strain analysis provides comparable strain values to contemporary standards. Strain can be
translated into digital simulations of the heart for predictive modeling.
