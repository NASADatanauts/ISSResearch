Abstract
Our previous results with flight (FLT) mice showed abnormalities in thymuses and spleens that have potential to
compromise immune defense mechanisms. In this study, the organs were further evaluated in C57BL/6 mice after
Space Shuttle Atlantis returned from a 13-day mission. Thymuses and spleens were harvested from FLT mice and
ground controls housed in similar animal enclosure modules (AEM). Organ and body mass, DNA fragmentation and
expression of genes related to T cells and cancer were determined. Although significance was not obtained for
thymus mass, DNA fragmentation was greater in the FLT group (P<0.01). Spleen mass alone and relative to body
mass was significantly decreased in FLT mice (P<0.05). In FLT thymuses, 6/84 T ceII-reIated genes were affected

down: Cd025a, E2F1, Mmp9, Myc). In the spleen, 8/84 cancer—related genes were affected in FLT mice compared to
AEM controls (P<0.05; up: Cdkn2a; down: Birc5, Casp8, Ctnnb1, Map2k1, Mdm2, NFkB1, Pdgfa). Pathway analysis
(apoptosis signaling and checkpoint regulation) was used to map relationships among the cancer—related genes. The
results showed that a relatively short mission in space had a significant impact on both organs. The findings also
indicate that immune system aberrations due to stressors associated with space travel should be included when
estimating risk for pathologies such as cancer and infection and in designing appropriate countermeasures. Although
this was the historic Iast flight of NASA’s Space Shuttle Program, exploration of space will undoubtedly continue.
