ABSTRACT: It is expected that a protein depletion zone and an impurity deple-
tion zone are formed around a crystal during protein crystal growth if the dif-
fusion field around the crystal is not disturbed. The growth rate of the crystal
may be decreased and the impurity uptake may be suppressed to result in high-
ly ordered crystals if these zones are not disturbed. It is well known that a
microgravity environment can reduce convective ﬂuid motion, and this is
thought to disturb the depletion zones. Therefore, we expect that crystals
grown in space can attain better quality than those grown on the ground. In
this study, we estimate the depletion zone formation numerically and discuss
the results of crystallization in space experiments. In case of a-amylase, most
of the crystals form a cluster-like morphology on the ground using PEG 8000
as a precipitant. However, in space, we have obtained a single and high-quality
crystal grown from the same sample compositions. We have measured the Vis-
cosity of the solution, the diffusion coefﬁcient, and the growth rate of protein
crystals on the ground. Applying numerical analysis to these values a signiﬁ-
cant depletion zone was expected to form mainly due to higher values of the
Viscosity. This might be one of the main reasons for better quality single crys-
tals grown in space, where the depletion zone is thought to remain undis-
turbed. For protein crystallization experiments, salts are widely used as a
precipitant. However, in that case, reduced concentration depletion zone
effects can be expected because of a low Viscosity. Therefore, if it is possible to
increase the Viscosity of the protein solution by means of an additive, the deple-
tion zone formation effect would be enhanced to provide a technique that
would be especially effective in space.

impurities, microcrystals, and small nuclei around the growing crystals.1 These

concentration gradients form depletion zones around the growing crystal that help
to form high quality crystals with an impurity ﬁltration effect, lowering the protein
concentration to reduce the crystal growth rate to allow time for the molecules to
become ordered in Ciystal.2_4 However, on the ground, because of gravity, these
depletion zones are disturbed by convective ﬂuid motions and sedimentation.5_8

It is well known that a microgravity environment may maintain ideal depletion
zones for protein crystal growth and may contribute to obtaining high-resolution dif-
fracting crystals, with better internal order and fewer defects.9’10 Using the applied
protein crystallization facility (APCF) in space, a quasiperfect diffusive ﬁeld was
observed.11

Alpha-amylase (E.C.3.2. l . 1) derived from Aspergillus oryzae, a glycoprotein that
catalyzes the hydrolysis of the oc-l,4-glycosidic linkage in starch, was Chosen for the
model protein because it is a well known and readily available protein that is useful
as a model protein for many physiologically signiﬁcant protein crystal growth pro-
cesses. According to our previous experiments, a maj or problem of crystallization of
oc-amylase using PEG 8000 as a precipitant on the ground was formation of a Cluster-
like morphology. We performed oc-amylase crystallization experiments during the

Odissea mission kindly donated by BSA, in 2002, and obtained high quality crystals

with different morphology from that of ground-grown crystals, without Cluster-like

formation.12 We eXpected that the following points would be emphasized by the
space experiments:

1. The protein depletion zone might decrease the density of protein molecules
around the growing crystal, so that the crystal growth rate would be reduced and
the protein molecules would be incorporated in order in the crystal and the qual-
ity of the crystal would be improved.

2. The impurity depletion zone might reduce the concentration of impurities
around the growing crystal, so that impurity incorporation into the crystal would
be decreased and the quality of the crystal improved.

3. The protein depletion zone might decrease the probability of the nuclei forma-
tion on the surface of the growing crystal, so that the possibility of the Cluster-
like morphology would be reduced.

In this report, we use numerical analysis of the depletion zone formation around

a growing protein crystal to estimate the effects of depletion zones.

Measurement of Solution Viscosity

The coefﬁcient of Viscosity of the PEG 8000 solution was measured by the cap-
illary method. The ratio of the coefﬁcient of Viscosity between 18% and 22% PEG
8000 solution, approximated by measured values, was used to calculate the diffusion
coefﬁcient of OL-amylase in 22% PEG 8000 solution.

Measurement of the Diffusion Coefﬁcient

The thin layer diffusion pair method was used to measure the diffusion coefﬁ-
cients of OL-amylase in an 18% PEG 8000 solution, which did not crystallize the
protein.12 The diffusion coefﬁcient in 22% PEG 8000, at which concentration the
crystallization experiment would be performed in space, was estimated from the
kinetic Viscosity ratio.

Estimation of Solubility

To estimate the approximate solubility of OL-amylase in PEG 8000 solution, crys-
tallization experiments of OL-amylase using PEG 8000 as a precipitant were per-
formed by a batch method. Several concentrations of the protein and the precipitant
were prepared. After several days crystal growth was Observed. The approximate s01-
ubility was estimated as a slightly lower concentration that that at which crystalliza-
tion occurred.

Measurement of Growth Rate

Crystal growth in conditions of 30mg/m1 OL-amylase and 22% PEG 8000 was
Observed by an Optical microscope during a crystallization experiment performed by
a batch method. Using the time required to grow to half size, [3 was calculated
according to the following approximate estimation method.

Estimation of [3

Since it is difﬁcult to measure the correct value of [3, we used the following model
to approximate [3 easily. If the crystal is presumed spherical, the protein molecule
weight (mg) in the crystal is

1000 - n - g «1330), (1)
where R(t) is the radius of the crystal (cm) at time t and n is the relative density of
the crystal.

Although several crystals with various sizes usually grew in one batch, we pre-
sumed that all the crystals grew to the same size at once, and that one Of the crystals
grew from the solution with spherical shape, radius L (cm). In this case, the amount
of protein removed from the protein solution is

C(O) - i‘nL3 — C(t) - (ﬁnﬁ — i‘mﬁw), (2)
3 3 3
where C (0) and C (t) are the concentrations of protein (mg/ml) at the beginning and
at time t, respectively. Combining (1) with (2), gives the following equation:

Estimation oflmpurity Depletion Filtration Effects
Impurity uptake into the crystal was driven by attachment to the crystal surface,
which depended on the concentration of the impurity.1 Here we ignore the dissocia-
tion of the impurity from the crystal because it was supposed to be considerably
smaller than uptake.

means that the impurity depletion zone is effective.

RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
Estimation of Solubility
Occurrence crystallization was demonstrated by using a batch method for each
experiment. In FIGURE 1 each * indicates the concentration of OL-amylase and PEG
8000 when crystallization occurred. Each 9 indicates when crystallization did not
occur. The solubility of OL-amylase was roughly estimated to be 10mg/m1 for PEG
8000 concentrations greater than 22%, a concentration at which crystallization was
estimated to occur in a space experiment.
Coefﬁcients Obtained from the Experimental Results
The values Obtained from experiments performed to determine the coefﬁcients
are shown in TABLE 1. Using these results gave [3 = 0.09 mmhr‘l. This value is about
four times larger than the [3 value for lysozyme.1
The diffusion coefﬁcient of OL-amylase in 22% PEG 8000 was estimated from the
ratio of the kinetic Viscosity in 18% and 22% PEG 8000 solutions. The diffusion
coefﬁcient of OL-amylase in 18% PEG 8000 was divided by the ratio (1.67) to Obtain
the value in 22% PEG 8000.
Numerical Estimation of Protein Depletion Zone Formation Around a Crystal
As shown in Equation (9), the larger the crystal grew, and the smaller the diffu-
sion coefﬁcient, the lower the protein concentration on the crystal surface. In the
case Of OL-amylase, if the values described above are substituted in Equation (10), the
protein depletion zone formation is Obtained, as shown in FIGURE 2. As the ﬁgure
shows, for an OL-amylase crystal whose size was suitable for X-ray diffraction data
collection (about several dozen um), DFR 0n the surface of the crystal decreased sig-
niﬁcantly. The larger the crystal, the weaker the driving force.

We Obtained high quality OL-amylase crystals, without Cluster-like formation,

Numerical analysis of the depletion zone around the growing crystals as analyzed in
this paper suggested that the reduction of DFR was signiﬁcantly explained by: (1)
reduced disorder of the crystal because of crystal growth in lower supersaturation
conditions around the crystal surface, and (2) Cluster-like formation was avoided
because of suppression of nuclei formation on the surface of the crystal due to the
lower supersaturation condition around the crystal surface.

was expected, especially under conditions in which it was easy to form an impurity
depletion zone. Therefore, from this numerical estimate, it was expected that impu-
rity uptake could be decreased and a better quality crystal Obtained that would be dif-
fracted with higher resolution in the case of OL-amylase crystallization in space.

Expected Effect ofDepletion Zone Formation with
Change in Diffusion Coefﬁcient of the Solution

If the diffusion coefﬁcient of lysozyme in a low viscosity precipitant solution,
such as salt solution, is substituted in Equation (10), then the concentration of pro-
tein solution on the surface of the lysozyme crystal does not decrease sufﬁciently, as
shown in FIGURE 4. It does not Change even though the diffusion coefﬁcient
decreased to one-half 0r one-fourth, both of Which are realistic. It suggested that the
low Viscosity precipitant solution cannot easily provide a sufﬁcient depletion zone
effect in the space experiment.

As shown in FIGURE 5, the impurity uptake ﬁltration (IUF) is not as effective as
OL-amylase crystallization. However, if the coefﬁcient of Viscosity could somehow be
made four times higher (the diffusion coefﬁcient is one-fourth), the IUF effect might
be expected to be enhanced, as shown in FIGURE 6. In this case, impurity uptake ﬁl—
tration by the impurity depletion zone was more effective than the protein depletion
zone effect.

Thus, if the diffusion coefﬁcient of the protein can be reduced several times, the
impurity depletion zone effect might be expected, even in the salt solutions, and high
quality crystal obtained. The addition of highly Viscous material to the solution
could be considered.
