Abstract The experiment LSO (Lightning and Sprite Observations) on board of the In—
ternational Space Station is the ﬁrst experiment dedicated to sprite observations
at the nadir. Such observations are difﬁcult because the luminous emissions of
sprites and lightning can be superimposed When they are observed from space
at the nadir. Such observations are however needed for measuring simultane—
ously all possible emissions (radio, X—v, high energy electrons) associated With
sprites for a better understanding of the implied mechanisms. They are possible
in speciﬁc spectral lines Where sprites are differentiated from lightning. Absorp—
tion bands of the atmosphere are well adapted for this differentiation because
the light emissions from sprites occurring in the middle and upper atmosphere
are less absorbed in these bands than lightning emissions occurring more deeply
in the atmosphere. The most intense spectral emission band of the sprites, cor—
responding to the N21P band at 761 nm, partly superimposed With the oxygen
absorption A band of the atmosphere, is used by the LSC) experiment. The eX—
periment is composed of two micro—cameras, one in the Visible and near infra
red, the other equipped With an adapted ﬁlter. Only sprites, halos and super—
bolts, Which correspond to a Class of rare very intense lightning, are transmitted
through the ﬁlter. Sprites, halos and superbolts are identiﬁed by the ratio of the
intensities received through the ﬁlter and in the Whole spectrum. This ratio is
lower for superbolts than for sprites and halos. The response of the sprites is
also more complex and variable than the response of superbolts Which is very
ﬂat and comparable from an event to another. Finally, LSO observed 17 sprites,
3 halos and 9 superbolts. Several examples of differentiation of sprite and super—
bolts are given. The results of a ﬁrst global statistical study are also presented.

7.1 Introduction

Most of the observations of sprites are performed from planes (Sentman
et al., 1995) and from the ground in different parts of the world (Lyons et al.,
2003; Hardman et al., 2000; Neubert et al., 2001; Su et al., 2002) at the horizon
Where sprites are spatially differentiated from the lightning ﬂashes. Different
types of emissions (jets, halos, elves) called T LE (T ransient Luminous Events,
Lyons et al., 2000) have been identiﬁed. Recent observations provide details of
the space and time evolution of these phenomena (Gerken et al., 2000; Moudry
et al., 2003). The ﬁrst space observation of sprites was performed during thun—
derstorm observations (B oeck et al., 1998). Few experiments are now designed
for sprite observations from space at the horizon: (i) MEIDEX onboard of the
Space Shuttle performed 7 hours of sprite observations over thunderstorms
(Yair et al., 2004), (ii) the ISUAL experiment is the ﬁrst sprite experiment on—
board a satellite (Chapter 6).

However sprites are complex phenomena and the emissions in the Visible
constitute only a part of the emissions related With sprites. T heoretical stud—
ies show that sprites can be produced by electrostatic electric ﬁelds above the
altitude Where the thunderstorm electric ﬁeld exceeds the air breakdown elec—
tric ﬁeld threshold (Pasko et al., 1997). This process predicts ELF electro—
static emissions Which can be observed at the ground (Cummer et al., 1998;
Fullekrug et al., 2001). Electromagnetic pulses are involved in the elve for—
mation (Barrington—Leigh et al., 2001). Sprites have also been explained by
relativistic runaway electrons triggered by cosmic radiation (Roussel—Dupre’
and A., 1996; Roussel—Dupre’ et al., 1998). The resulting high energy elec—
tron beam interacts With the atmosphere producing intense electromagnetic
radio emissions in a large frequency range in the HF—VHF part of the spectrum
and X—gamma emissions by bremsstrahlung process. Both conventional and
runaway processes could occur in parallel (Roussel—Dupre’ et al., 2002). The
runaway electron theory is supported by the observations of X and y ray emis—
sions from the Earth’s atmosphere (Fishman et al., 1994; Feldman et al., 1995;
Lopez et al., 2004). Ground based observations of energetic radiation up to
many tens of MeV, produced during rocket triggered lightning shows that this
process is more frequent than expected (Dwyer et al., 2004).

For a better understanding of these mechanisms, simultaneous measure—
ments of all these emissions from space are needed. However, these observa—
tions are difﬁcult to realize, because the light emissions of sprites are then su—
perimposed on the intense light emissions of the lightning diffused by Clouds.

The LSO (Lightning and Sprite Observations) experiment on board of the
International Space Station (ISS) has been designed to perform sprite observa—
tions at the nadir using an original method of spectral differentiation between
sprites and lightning by an adapted ﬁlter. The ﬁrst sprite observations obtained

in the frame of the Andromede and Odissea missions were shown by Blane

et al. (2004). The results of new observations performed in the frame of Cer—

vantes and Delta missions are presented in this Chapter. A ﬁrst statistic of the

global LSO observations obtained up to now is also presented.

7.2 Spectral Differentiation of Sprite and Lightning
Emissions

The frequency band, used for the selective spectral measurements of
sprites, corresponds to the most intense emission line of sprites N21P at
762.7 nm, or N2 (B3Hg — A323) (3 — 1). The interest of this spectral
band is that it includes a signiﬁcant part of the absorption band of the 02
(I912; — X323) (0 — 0) absorption band near 761.9 nm. For this reason, the
sprite emission line N21P does not appear on the sprite spectra measured at the
ground (Hampton et al., 1996; Morrill et al., 1998) where the dioxygen den—
sity is important. On the contrary, this emission will be observed from space
because of a weaker dioxygen density above the sprite. The light emissions,
within this band, from lightning, produced deeper in the atmosphere, will be
absorbed, as well as all man made emissions from the ground surface. The
spectral band selected for LSO corresponds to the most intense emission band
of the sprites determined by using the theoretical spectrum of sprites provided
by Milikh et al. (1998), see Figure 1. Figure 2 shows the solar light trans—
mission from 754 to 770 nm (Solar Survey Archive—2000, 2005) superimposed
with the ﬁlter response and the sprite spectrum N21P peak. The ﬁlter width
of the LSO ﬁlter is 10 nm, it has been optimized for receiving the maximum
of energy from the sprites and ﬁltering the lightning emission through the at—
mospheric absorption. A narrower width selected where the absorption band
is the most intense would optimize the spectral differentiation of sprites and
lightning but a more sensitive camera is necessary to measure very low sprite
intensities.

The possible emission of lightning in the same spectral band has been es—
timated by using the lightning spectrum measured by Orville and Henderson
(1984) and the camera and ﬁlter responses. The intensity received through the
ﬁlter is expected to be about 1% of the total spectrum.

7.3 Experiment

The ﬁrst LSO measurements were performed in the frame of the ﬂight of the
French astronaut Claudie Haignere’ (Andromede mission) on the International
Space Station in October 2001. The experiment was developed by the Com—
missariat a l’Energie Atomique with the participation of the Centre National
d’Etudes Spatiales. The measurements were realized with the collaboration
of RKK Energia (Russia). Additional observations were performed in 2002

obtained from September 1“ to 5th, 2003 and from 1“ to 5th October 2003 in

the frame of the ESA Cervantes mission (ﬂight of the Spanish astronaut) and
from April 24th to 26th, 2004 in the frame of the ESA Delta mission (ﬂight
of the Netherlands astronaut). However one camera failed during the Delta
experiment and only the Cervantes data were used for sprite observations. In
total, 19 h of effective observations are available up to now.

The 188 orbit is at about 400 km altitude, the inclination is 51.60. This orbit
is well adapted to the observation of sprites and lightning ﬂashes which mainly
occur at low and middle latitudes. The observations are performed when the
station is stabilized during several days per month. The two—line norad orbital
elements are used by LSO programs to predict the ISS orbit characteristics.

The experiment (Figure 3) is composed of two microcameras, one equipped
with the ﬁlter adapted to the observations of sprites and the other in the to—
tal camera spectral range which extends from 400 up to 1000 nm (Figure 1).
The camera response is maximum at 690 nm. The cameras are connected
to an electronic box and to one Experiment Processing Computer which is
only dedicated to the camera programs and data archiving. The digital space
micro—cameras have been developed by CSEM (Centre Suisse d’Electronique
et de Microelectronique, now Space—X). The objectives have a focal length
of 14 mm, an aperture of f/3.5 and a ﬁeld of View of 700. The images are
taken on 1024>< 1024 pixels with 10 bits dynamic range but only the central
part of the CCD (512x512 pixels) is used (the effective ﬁeld of View is then
39.80). The pixel length is 14 pm with a pixel aperture ratio of 0.71 due to the
anti—blooming system. The images of both cameras are taken simultaneously.
Because of the very rapid development time of the experiment (3.5 months), it
has not been possible to lower the data transmission time of both images time
below 5.5 s. The time exposure is 1 s. The precision in time is one second. The
cameras are ﬁxed on an ISS window. Both cameras were calibrated for quanti—

tative measurements of brightness (Blane et al., 2004). The spectral sensitivity
of both cameras is 45 uJ/m2/sr at 765 nm for 1 LSB (least signiﬁcant bit) or
about 2.10—4ft candles (NZ mLuX), which is comparable with the sensitivity of
the camera used for the ﬁrst sprite measurements from space (Vaughan, 1994).

The measurements are automatic. The astronaut enters the dates of the be—
ginning and of the experiment and the two lines norad elements needed by the
on board computation program. Data are archived on a removable disk which
is brought back to the ground by the astronaut.

Observations are performed during the night and mainly over continents,
were most of the storms are expected according to the T RMM (T ropical Rain—
fall Measurement Mission) satellite observations (Christian et al., 2003). One
observation area has been selected over the Paciﬁc Ocean to represent ocean
conditions. The observation areas covered during the Cervantes mission are
shown in Figure 4.

7.4 Observations

At the end of the Odissea mission, LSO observed 60 transitory events with
the camera in the Visible and 13 events with both cameras. The ﬁrst Class of
events observed by both cameras corresponds to sprites. It is deﬁned by a ratio
of both cameras’ intensities higher than 3% (Figure 5, left and middle). T hese
events are Characterized by a complex spatial response and the ratio is variable
inside a same event. Also the response is variable from one event to another.
Ten events belonging to this Class were identiﬁed in this ﬁrst experiment set
(Blane et al., 2004). The second Class of events, observed by both cameras,
is Characterized by a lower intensity ratio of about 1% (Figure 5, right), the
ratio is quite stable over the event spatial coverage, in addition the response
is comparable from one event to another. T hey have been identiﬁed as very
intense lightning called superbolts with a power from 3.1011 to 7.1012 W (T ur—
man, 1977). Only about 1% of lightning belongs to this lightning Class. The
LSO ﬁlter suppresses the response of most lightning, but the intensity of the
superbolts is sufﬁcient to provide a response in the ﬁlter.

The analysis of the new data obtained in the frame of the Cervantes mission
conﬁrms the ﬁrst results about these two Classes of events. An example of a
sprite event observed in this data set is shown in the Figure 6 with the same
color scale as in Figure 5. The complexity of this event arises from the presence
of three different ﬂashes, observed in the same image because of the 1 second
of integration time of the observations. The three events are differentiated by
the ratio of both cameras. The sprite appears in red in the picture of the ratio
of the cameras’ intensities, indicating a ratio value higher than 6%. Differently
the two other emissions appear in blue with a ratio of about 1% or in yellow
and green with a ratio of 2 or 3%. As a superbolt is Characterized by a ratio of

Figure 6. Simultaneous observation of a sprite and a superbolt performed on October 3rd,

sprite. It is about 1% for the superbolt. The most intense event in the Visible and in the ﬁlter
corresponds to a ratio of 2 t0 3% and could be explained by the presence of a halo.

1%, the ratio increase could indicate the presence of an halo superposed with
the lightning. When isolated, halos have been identiﬁed by a ratio comparable
or slightly lower than the sprite ratio, but with a larger geometric extension and
a response more ﬂat.

During the 19 hours of observations, 40 events were observed with both
cameras. The ﬁrst 13 hours correspond to the ﬁrst data set analyzed by Blanc
et a1. (2004). Table 1 provides the characteristics of the additional events ob—
served during the Cervantes mission. In total, 17 sprites were identiﬁed with 3
isolated halos. T hree sprites, not clearly identiﬁed are not taken into account
in this number. Also 9 superbolts were identiﬁed. The three, indicated in bold,
are among the most intense events observed by LSO. The sprite observation
frequency is then about 1.7 per hour. The number of sprites observed by MEI—
DEX onboard of the Space shuttle is 2.6 sprites per hour, and 4 T LE per hour
(Yair et al., 2004). This number is higher but the cameras were oriented to
observe the regions of interest according to the probability of lightning activity
and the astronaut adjusted the camera pointing angle for lightning observations,
increasing the probability to observe T LEs.

Figure 7 shows the local time distribution of the 40 events observed by both
cameras of LSD. The local time is deduced from the universal time taking
into account the position of the 133 at the measurement time. The maximum
of activity is observed near midnight. The distribution is not related to the
lightning nighttime distribution which is decreasing regularly from 18—7 LT
(local time), the maximum being at about 14 LT (MacGorman and Rust, 1998).

LSO observed 180 ﬂashes corresponding to the most intense lightning. The
number of lightning ﬂashes which effectively occurred during the 19 h of the
LS0 measurements can be estimated by using the LIS data measured on board
of the T RMM satellite in the same period of observation (LIS/OT D webpage,
2002; Christian et al., 2003). This number of lightning ﬂashes is estimated
about 1100. This estimation takes into account the respective observation areas
of LIS and LSO and the fact that LSO measures only over the continents, where
88% of the lightning occur. The occurrence of sprites is then 1.4 sprites for
100 lightning ﬂashes. Taking into account that the global number of lightning
determined from LIS observations is 44 ﬂashes per second (Christian et al.,
2003), the global number of sprites per minute could be about 37. This number
is more important than the global number of sprites estimated by (Yair et al.,
2004) which is 7.5 sprites per minute. The reason is that the LS0 observations
are performed over continents where most of the lightning ﬂashes occur. This
increases the probability to observe sprites.

Figure 8 shows the intensity distribution of the 203 events observed by LSD
in the Visible. This include sprites, lightning and superbolts. The superbolts
correspond to the most intense events observed by LSO. Among the 5 most
intense events, 4 are superbolts and 1 is a sprite.

7.5 Perspectives
The results obtained by LSO show that sprites and lightning ﬂashes ob—
served from space at the nadir can be differentiated by using adapted ﬁlters.
This differentiation has been performed by the comparison of the response of
two cameras, one in the Visible and the other in the N21P sprite emission band,
which partly coincides With the dioxygen absorption band. Sprites are also sep—
arated spatially from lightning. It is expected that the mean distance between
sprites and lightning is about 40 km in agreement With ground based observa—

were identiﬁed in the LSO dataset available up to now.
This differentiation could be improved by increasing the time resolution of
the measurements. The mean time difference between sprites and lightning

ﬂashes measured by the National Lightning detection network is about 20 to
30 ms (Sao Sabbas et al., 2003). Other observations using ELF—ULF measure—
ments found that the difference can be smaller or larger, varying from an event
to another (Bell et al., 1988). Cummer and Fﬁllekrug (2001) showed that the
time delay depends on the Charge moment.

In addition to the spectral differentiation realized by LSD in the red part of
the spectrum, measurements can be performed in the Violet and ultraviolet part
of the spectrum. The ﬁrst results of ISUAL showed that the lightning lights
completely disappeared in the 150—280 nm wavelength range and in the N2 2P
sprite emission band at 337 nm (Chapter 6).

The measurement concept studied by the LSO experiment Will be used by
the microsatellite TARANIS (Tool for the Analysis of RAdiation from light—
NIng and Sprites) dedicated to measure simultaneously the optical, X and 7
emissions, the electric and magnetic ﬁeld from ELF up to HF, and the high en—
ergy electrons associated With sprites for a better understanding of the implied
mechanisms. The ﬁnal goal is the study of the coupling between atmosphere,
ionosphere and magnetosphere associated With thunderstorm activity and the
effects of these phenomena on the Earth’s environment (Blanc and Lefeuvre,
2003) .
