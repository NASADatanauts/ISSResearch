A Synchrotron Radiation Detector measures synchrotron radiation emitted by high energetic particles in the
earth magnetic ﬁeld. This allows to identify cosmic ray electrons and positrons with energies in the TeV region.
One possibility for such a detector outside the atmOSphere uses YAP crystals to measure synchrotron photons
with energies in the keV range. As such a detector can not distinguish between photons and electrons, the main
problems are the diffuse cosmic ray gamma background and low energetic electrons in the vicinity of the earth.
While the intensity of the diffuse gamma rays is known quite well, there exists limited knowledge about keV-
electrons in low earth orbits. To measure these electrons a Prototype Synchrotron Radiation Detector (PSRD)
was ﬂown with Space Shuttle mission STS-108 (Dec.2001) and preliminary analysis of the data show very favorable
results.
