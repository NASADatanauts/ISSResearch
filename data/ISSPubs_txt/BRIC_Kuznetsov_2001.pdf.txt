ABSTRACT

The effect of spaceﬂight on starch development in soybean (Glycine maxL., BRIC-03) and potato (Solamzm tuberosum,
Astroculture-OS) was compared with ground controls by biophysical and biochemical measurements. Starch grains from
plants from both ﬂights were on average 20-50% smaller in diameter than ground controls. The ratio Ax/Ap (Ax -
difference of magnetic susceptibilities, Ap - difference of densities between starch and water) of starch grains was ca.
15% and 4% higher for space-grown soybean cotyledons and potato tubers, respectively, than in corresponding ground
controls. Since the densities of particles were similar for all samples (1.36 to 1.38 g/cm3), the observed difference in
AWAp was due to different magnetic susceptibilities and indicates modiﬁed composition of starch grains. In starch
preparations from soybean cotyledons (BRIC-OB) subjected to controlled enzymatic degradation with cc-amylase for 24
hours, 77d:6% of the starch from the ﬂight cotyledons was degraded compared to 58$} 2% in ground controls. The
amﬂose content in starch was also higher in space-grown tissues. The good correlation between the amylose content and
AWAp suggests, that the magnetic susceptibility of starch grains is related to their amylose content. Since the seedlings
from the BRIC-03 experiment showed elevated post-ﬂight ethylene levels, material from another ﬂight experiment
(GENEX) which had normal levels of ethylene was examined and showed no difference to ground controls in size
distribution, density, Ax/Ap and amylose content. Therefore the role of ethylene appears to be more important for
changes in starch metabolism than microgravity. © 2001 COSPAR. Published by Elsevier Science Ltd‘ All rights reserved.
INTRODUCTION

Several studies have reported alterations in starch structure and metabolism in plants grown in microgravity
conditions (Brown et a1. , 1995, 1996', Croxdale er al. 1996)‘ In these experiments (1) lower starch concentrations, (2)
higher activity of the starch degrading enzymes, (3) lower activity of ADP glucose pyrophosphorylase, an enzyme
involved in starch synthesis, and (4) reduced starch grains size in space-grown plants were reported. In addition, elevated
ethylene levels were observed in some growth containers. However, Tibbitts et a1. (1996) detected no major differences
in starch or plant anatomy. In later experiments (GENEX, STS-87, Stryjewski er a1. , 1998) ethylene concentrations in
ﬂight and ground were equivalent due to increased gas exchange between the growth canister and the cabin. In these
experiments starch concentration in space was partially higher than in ground controls, at least near vascular structures
of hypocotyls. These results indicated that the chemical composition of starch can be affected by either microgravity or
conditions associated with microgravity.

Since starch is a signiﬁcant component of the human diet, plants with high starch content and high nutritional value
(wheat, rice, potato, soybean) are of value for space exploration. The study of starch metabolism is important for
assessing the nutritional value and to determine if starch metabolism is affected by microgravity or growth conditions
on spacecraft.

We studied starch from plants grown on orbit and parallel ground controls from three different sources: potato from
Astroculture-S (STS—73) and soybean from BR] C —3 (STS-63) and GENEX (STS-8 7) ﬂights. 1n the ﬁrst two experiments
the plants were grown in a closed system, while the GENEX ﬂight experiment provided adequate ventilation to prevent
ethylene build-up.

Because of the complex nature of starch (Myers et a1. , 2000) characterization by any single means is insufﬁcient.
Rather, complementary techniques can best detect modiﬁcations in starch from diverse origins and / or growth conditions.
Our data consider magnetograviphoretie behavior, size, density, and amylose content. Magnetograviphoresis (Kuznetsov
er al. , 1993; Kuznetsov and Komissarov 1993; Kuznetsov and Hasenstein, 1997) analyzes the behavior of starch grains
in water in a non-uniform magnetic ﬁeld, and in combination with density determinations measures their magnetic
susceptibility. Size and density of amyloplasts are important prOperties of starch, because these parameters determine
mobility and mass of this erystal-like grain. Starch consists mostly of the glucose polymers amylopeetin and amylose,
with amylopeetin representing the bulk of the granule that determines its structure (Myers et a1. , 2000). Changes in the
relative content of amylose and amylopectin are likely to cause changes of the structure, density and shape of starch. Such
structural alterations may affect the degradability and, thus, metabolism of starch. Thus efforts aimed at the
characterization of starch from space and ground-grown plants help determine which factors contribute to the formation
and modiﬁcation of starch both under spaceﬂight and ground conditions.

MATERIALS AND METHODS

Plant material.

Soybeans (Glycine max L. cv. McCall). Tissue (one plant each) from ﬂight experiment (BRIC-O3, STS-63, frozen in
orbit 5 days after imbibition) and from a ground control was used. Starch grains were extracted from one cotyledon each
from ﬂight and ground samples and from one complete hypocotyl for magnetograviphoretic, size and density
measurements. The remaining cotyledons were cut into four pieces each and used for starch quantiﬁcation and
measurement of amylose content.

The second batch of soybean tissue was available from the GENEX experiment (STS-87). Groups of 6 seedlings
were grown for 6 days in orbit inside plastic packets, 8 of which were placed in BRIC—60 canisters (Levine er a1. , 2000,
Stryjewski et 01.,1998). These canisters were ventilated and resulting ethylene concentration were equivalent between
the ﬂight and ground control experiments (Levine er a1. , 2000). The tissue was frozen in liquid N 2 post-ﬂight immediately
upon recovery and stored frozen until use. Two packets with 6 plants each (set A and B) were available from ﬂight, and
another two (set A’ and B’) from the ground control‘ Three randomly selected cotyledons from different plants from each
packet were used for starch grain extraction, yielding six ﬂight and six ground samples. Another four randomly selected
cotyledons from each group of cotyledons were cut into tip, middle and basal segments and three of the tip and three of
the basal sections were used for the measurements of starch concentration and amylose content.

Potato (Solanum tuberosum). Tubers were grown on a 16-day space shuttle mission (Astroeulture-OS, STS-73) and
frozen post-ﬂight. Ethylene concentration was not controlled App roximately 40 mg of homogenized frozen tuber tissue
was available from both the ﬂight and ground controls.

Starch grain extraction.

Plastids were isolated from frozen tissue, which was gently homogenized in 0.2 ml Mes-Tris buffer (50 mM, pH
6.2) on ice, washed and ﬁltered through 10 pm polyester mesh (Kuznetsov and Hasenstein, 1997), and centriﬁJged
(400,000 g min on 1.29 g/ml sucrose). The pellet was re-suSpended in dist. water, washed ﬁve times and used for
measurements.

Determination of grain density and size.

Density was determined by centriﬁigation in step-gradient metrizamide solutions as described earlier (Kuznetsov
and Hasenstein, 1997; Kuznetsov er al. , 1999) and stained with IKI. The (largest) diameter of 500-6000 starch grains
from each sample was determined by microscopy.

Particle Magnetograviphoresis.

Magnetic susceptibility of the starch grains was measured by particle magnetograviphoresis (Piruzyan et a1. , 1980;
Kuznetsov et al., 1993; Kuznetsov and Komissarov, 1993; Kuznetsov and Hasenstcin, 1997) on a custom-built
instrument. A suspension of particles was delivered into a glass capillary tube (about 150 pm inner diameter) which was

"

mounted in a 175 pm wide gap between magnetic poles. The sedimentation velocity (Vsed) of amyloplasts was measured
over a range of 30 pm in the absence of the magnetic ﬁeld by video-microsc0py. Then the ﬁeld was switched on, and
the upward velocity (Vup) of the particles was determined. Each of 50 to 100 particles was measured several times,
yielding 80 to 250 measurements per sample-

Calculations and calibration of the device were perfomied as described previously (Kuznetsov and Hasenstein,
1997), and were based on the equation:

Ax/A p = [(Vup+Vsed)/Vsed]/[V(H2/2)/g], (1)

Determination of amylose/amylopectin ratio in starch.

Amylose content in starch was measured using a technique modiﬁed from Hovenkamp-Hermelink er a1. (1988).
Starch was extracted by grinding 10 - 45 mg of frozen tissue in 0.5 m1 of 45% I-IC104 with a Teﬂon piston. Aﬁer ca.
4 minutes the tissue was Completely macerated and 4.5 ml of dist. H20 was added. The resulting suspension was
centrifuged for 60 min at 3,500 g and supernatant was ﬁltered through a 10 pm polyester mesh. The resulting clear
solution was diluted 1+0.8, 1+2.6, 1+8, l+29 with 4.5% HC104 (v+v). Ofthese solutions, 0.9 ml was thoroughly mixed
with 0. 1 m1 of the [KI solution (2.67 g/l [(1 + 1 .34 g/l 12 in 4.5% HC104) in a spectrophotometer cuvette and immediately
measured in a spectrOphotometer (Pharmacia—Biotech Ultrospec 3000) against a blank of 0.9 m1 of 4.5% HC104 and
0.1 m1 of the [KI solution. Measurements were done at 618 and 550 nm, the absorption maxima of IKI-stained amylose
and amyIOpectin, respectively. Three measurements were made for each of the dilutions. At each wavelength (550 &
618 nm), the regression line (absorbency vs. concentration) was determined and the ratio (R) of the slopes at 618 and
550 nm was calculated. Assuming additivity of absorption values:

R = {PxGanm618 + (1 - P)xG><Aap618}/{P><G><Aam550 + (1 ~ P)><G><Aap550} (2)

where G is the starch concentration, P is the fraction of amylase. A represents absorption coefﬁcients at 550 and 618

nm of amylose (am) and amylopectin (ap), respectively (Hovenkamp-Hermelink er al., 1988). Because R is independent
of G, the percentage of amylose P can be calculated using the formula:

P = (Aapeis ' RXAap550)/[RX(Aamsso ‘ Aapsso) ' (Amen ' Aapelsﬂ- (3)

Starch concentration G was determined by:

G : A618/{Panm618 + (1 - p)anP618} and G = A550/{Panm550 + (1 - P)anP550} (4)
where A550 and A618 are absorbencies 0f the sample at 550 and 618 nm. Starch concentration was calculated based
on the absorbency at 550 and 618 nm, corrected for dilution and divided by the fresh weight of the sample. The
concentration (% of FW) was determined as the average of all data points.

The absorption coefﬁcients at 550 and 618 nm were measured by using potato amylase (Calbiochem, B29234) and
amylopectin (Sigma, A-8515), dissolved in 45% HCIO‘}, and diluted 1+9 with dist. H20 (v+v). They were determined
to be Aam550 : 17.13;1:11.1)2,Aa”""1618 = 24,02i0.03, A P550 = 7.63:0.01,Aap618 = 5.16:0.01(A><1xg'1).Mixtures
of amylose and amylopectin solutions (10, 20, 40, 60 and 80% of amylose), solutions with known concentrations of rice,
wheat, corn and potato starch (Sigma), as well as starch extracts from potato (red and yellow), sweet potato and soybean
were measured to verify the values for P and starch concentration and to estimate the error of the measurements.
Enzymatic degradation with alpha amylase.

Starch granules were isolated from four frozen soybean cotyledons from the BR1C—03 ﬂight and ﬁve cotyledons
from the ground control experiment (Sun and Henson, 1990). Cotyledons were ground separately with a mortar and pestle
in 1 ml extraction buffer (20 mM sodium acetate buffer, pH 6.5 + 0.02% sodium azide). An additional 1 ml of the buffer
was added to the mortar and the mixture was strained through 7 1.1m mesh nylon (N itex). The extract was layered onto
10 m1 of 65% (w/v) sucrose and centrifuged at 75,000 ngin, 3°C. The sedimented starch granules were re-suspended
in extraction buffer and recentriﬁaged twice more. The starch was resuspended in 0.5 m1 extraction buffer of which 50
pl were used for assays.

Starch degradation was measured by incubating mixtures containing 2% w/v starch, 0.5% w/v BSA, 0.02% sodium
azide, 2 mM CaClZ and 2 units of a-amylase in 0.5 ml at 37°C on a shaker. One sample each from the ﬂight and the
ground control experiments was incubated without the addition of OL-amylase as a blank to account for any endogenous
hydrolase activity. At zero and 24 hours, the reaction was stopped by boiling the samples for ﬁve minutes and the amount
of starch in each tube was determined as described above.

RESULTS

Densities of starch grains from the soybean and potato tissues from all experiments were between 1.36 and 1.38
(Table 1), and close to earlier values (Gaynor and Galston, I983; Kuznetsov and Hasenstein, 1997).

Starch grains isolated from spacc-grown potato tubers had a smaller mean diameter than those from ground control
(Table 1). There was also a greater proportion of small grains in ﬂight tubers compared to ground controls (Figure 1),
although the size range was identical. Flight and ground samples contained grains up to 35pm, similar to earlier electron
microscopic observations (Croxdale et al, 1996). Both cotyledon and hypocotyl soybean tissue from the BRIC-03
experiment showed a higher percentage of small grains (especially those <1 pm) in microgravity-grown tissue, but still
a full range of grain sizes was present (Figure 1, Table 1).

In contrast, soybean cotyledons from the GENEX space ﬂight and ground control experiments had an almost
identical size distribution of starch grains (Figure 1, Table 1). When starch grains from the GENEX experiment were
separated into a light (< 1.365 gxcm'3) and a dense fraction (> 1.365 gxcm'3), the lighter fraction was enriched with
smaller particles. With more then 40% of all grains, the smallest size class was the most abundant group (Figure 2) in
the ground control tissue, indicating that increase in size leads to denser starch. The ﬂight sample had more than 55%
of its starch grains in this category. The denser fraction of both ground and space samples showed a maximum in the 1-2
put size range. This distribution indicates that the number of initiated starch particles was higher in microgravity than
on the ground. As the starch grains enlarged, the size and density distribution equalized.

The ratio of Ax/Ap of starch grains from microgravity-groxm potato tissue was 4% higher, than that for the
ground control (Figure 3). Ax/Ap of grains from the space-grovm BRIC-03 soybean cotyledon was 14% higher than
those from the ground control, while that for hypocotyl starch was identical (Figu re 3). The average value for Ax/Ap
of grains from spaee—grovm GENEX soybean cotyledons was 5% (P = 0.026) higher than that for ground control.

However, differences in AK/Ap of starch grains from individual cotyledons within the categories (ﬂight and ground)
were much larger (Figure 4) and indicate high variability of the starch composition between individual plants.

The amylose/amylopectin ratios and the starch concentrations (% 0f FW) in individual soybean cotyledons from
the GENEX experiment were highly variable, even within the same cotyledon (Figure 5). All four packs (ﬂight and
ground) contained plants with high and low amylose and starch content, indicating high variability for both starch
concentration and starch composition between individual plants and probably variability in starch metabolism in different
organs. Mean values from the ﬂight and ground control experiments showed no difference for the amylose content

(P=0.02) but a small reduction of starch concentration for ﬂight samples (P=0.029, Figures 5 & 6).

The percentage of amylose in starch in ﬂight samples was consistently higher than that in corresponding ground
samples (Figure 7) and was similar to the distribution of AWAp (Figure 3). The ratios of AK/Ap and the amylose
content were very similar (within SE) for all samples and suggest that the relative amylose content strongly affects the
magnetic susceptibility (A x/A p) of starch (Figure 8).

Enmatic degradation of starch with oc-amvlase. After 24 hours of controlled digestion with a-amylase, 77i6% of the
starch from the ﬂight cotyledons was degraded (iSE) compared to 58i12% degradation of the starch from the ground
controls, indicating that the starch formed in space was easier to degrade than starch from ground controls (P=0. 1).
DISCUSSION

The measurements show that despite considerable differences in size (Table 1) and composition of space and
ground-grown starch, there was no profound difference between either condition. However, a closer examination of the
data revealed interesting results.

The measu rement of grain size distribution ofe-xtracted grains rather than in microscopic sections is more reliable
because isolated granules can be measu red intact whereas non-serial sections provide only fragments of the whole grain.
The size distribution of starch was different in ground and space samples, suggesting differences in starch structure or
starch metabolism. The larger proportion of smaller grains in ﬂight samples suggests a size-dependent deposition of
amylose and amylopectin.

The densities of space and ground control starch grains were similar, therefore the difference in AWAp is
probably due to the difference in magnetic susceptibility K of the starch grains, indicating a difference either in chemical
composition of starch or structure. This is supported by the strong correlation between the percentage of amylose and
Ax/Ap (Figures 3, 7 & 8). Therefore, it is reasonable to conclude, that the amylose content of the starch grains
determines magnetic susceptibility of the crystal-like starch structure and its magnetophoretic behavior. However,
differences in structure of amylopeetin (Myers et at, 2000), associated proteins or membrane can contribute to the
observed differences in magnetic susceptibility. In addition, differences in densities between smaller and larger grains
and size-dependent packaging of amylopeetin and amylose might affect AK/Ap. Differences in degradability of starch
by a—amylase between ﬂight and ground suggests alterations in the starch structure and thus availability of starch.

Because of the limited amount of tissue from the microgravity experiments (BRIC—03 and Astroculture) and the
large variability within tissue of the same origin (Figures 4 & 5) it is difﬁcult to distinguish whether the observed
differences in starch composition and properties are due to individual, physiological variation between the particular
tissue or due to a subtle but cumulative inﬂuence of microgravity 0r spaceﬂight-related conditions, such as elevated
ethylene levels. For example, the amount of starch extracted from soybean hypocotyls was insufﬁcient for reliable
measurements of amylose content, yielding high SE (Figures 7 & 8).

Results from the GENEX tissue, where ethylene was not a factor, showed signiﬁcant variability between
individual plants but small differences between ﬂight and ground control samples. Signiﬁcantly lower starch
concentration in the set B of the GEN EX experiment compared with the set A indicates a batch-speciﬁc difference. These
differences might not necessarily be a direct eFfect of microgravity, but could be the result of local ethylene
concentrations, differences in humidity, aeration or other factors. Our results illustrate the variability of the spaceﬂight
environment and underlines the necessity of providing uniform conditions for all experiments on board of spacecraﬁs to
ensure valid scientiﬁc data.

Increase in starch grain size and their Ax/A p in microgravity-grown plants grown in physiologically normal
ethylene levels (GENEX) indicates an influence of ethylene on starch metabolism, an area that has not received much
attention. Although the goal of the BRICv03 and GENEX experiments was not the physical assessment of starch, the
combination of several experiments and our analyses suggest that ethylene does affect starch methabolism. Our
measurements of size distribution and magnetophoretic properties of starch grains provide an integrated assessment of
the starch composition and supplement traditional biochemical techniques in studying starch metabolism.
