the crystals returned to Earth, the number, size and morphology of all crystals
were recorded, and X-ray data were collected from representative crystals. The
results generally agreed with previous microgravity crystallization studies. On
average, microgravity-grown crystals were 20% larger than control crystals
grown on Earth, and microgravity-grown crystals had a slightly improved
mosaicity (decreased by 0.030) and diffraction resolution (decreased by 0.2 A)
compared with control crystals grown on Earth. However, the highest resolution
and lowest mosaicity crystals were formed on Earth, and the highest-quality
crystal overall was formed on Earth after return from microgravity.
1. Introduction
Huntington’s disease (HD) is a progressive, late-onset
neurodegenerative disease characterized by neuronal death
resulting in choreiform movements, cognitive decline and
behavioral abnormalities (Ross et al., 2014). There is currently
no disease-modifying treatment or cure for HD (Skotte et 611.,
2014). HD is found in individuals with an abnormally
expanded N-terminal polyglutamine (polyQ) repeat in
huntingtin, a 350 kDa protein of unknown function. The
length of this polyQ tract inﬂuences the mechanisms of
aggregation and associated binding kinetics, with an increasing
propensity for aggregation with increasing polyQ tract length
(Thakur et 61]., 2009). HD is completely penetrant when the
polyQ repeat eXpands beyond a 41-glutamine threshold.
However, the mechanism underlying this transition is unclear,
and the relationship between polyQ-mediated aggregation,
