Abstract
In this paper, we present the results of Monte—Carlo simulations of the ﬂux and energy spectra of neutrons generated as a result of
galactic cosmic ray proton interactions with the material of International Space Station (ISS) inside Zvezda Service Module, the
Airlock between Russian and USA segments and one of Russian Research Modules for a full conﬁguration of ISS. Calculations
were made for ISS orbit for the energy ranges <10 and >10 MeV for both maximum and minimum of solar activity. To test the
accuracy of the calculations the same simulations were made for MIR orbital station and for CORONAS—I satellite and compared
with the results of measurements. Calculated and measured ﬂuxes are in reasonable agreement.
