to the c axis were both analyzed under supercooling ranging
from 0.03 to 2.0 K. The velocities of dendrite tips agree with the
theory for larger amounts of supercooling when the growth on
the basal faces are not zero. At very low supercooling there is no
growth on the basal faces. With increasing supercooling the basal faces start to grow, the growth rate changing as a function of
supercooling with a power law with an exponent of about 2, with the exponent approaching 1 as supercooling increases further. We
interpret the growth on the basal faces as being controlled by two—dimensional nucleation under low supercooling, with a change in
the growth kinetics to spiral growth with the aid of screw dislocations with increasing supercooling then to a linear growth law. We
discuss the combined effect of tip velocity and basal face kinetics on pattern formation during the growth of ice.

to above 0.5 K. We interpret the growth on the basal face as being
controlled by two-dimensional nucleation for AT < 0.1 K, which
changes to spiral growth with the aid of screw dislocations for
0.2 K < AT < 0.5 K then to a linear growth law with increasing
supercooling for AT > 0.5 K. Since these appears to be
disagreement between the theoretical curve and the tip velocities
for A < 0.002 in the temperature range in which there is no
growth on the basal face, we conclude that the basal face kinetics
signiﬁcantly affects the tip velocity rather than the asymmetric
shape with respect to the basal plane. It is, therefore, necessary to
develop the dendritic theory of ice taking into account the effect
of the growth of basal faces on the tip velocity. We also observed
that the growth rate of basal faces is quantized, that is, the growth
rate of thickness dh/dt suddenly changes with time. Since a
difference between the growth rates of two basal faces is a
possible mechanism for the appearance of the asymmetrical
shape of the disk, the evidence that |U+(t)| 75 |U_(t)| is
signiﬁcant.
