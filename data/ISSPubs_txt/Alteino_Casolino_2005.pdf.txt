We report on the measurements performed on board the International Space Station with the Sileye-3/Altein0
experiment between 27/4 and 1/5/2002. The instrument is constituted of a cosmic ray silicon detector and an
electroencephalograph to monitor radiation environment and study the light ﬂash phenomenon in space. In
this work we describe the relative nuclear abundance measurements in different regions of the orbit for nuclei
from B to Fe in the energy range above 2 60 MeV/n. As a result of nuclear fragmentation with the hull of the
station, abundances of heavy nuclei (Fe group) are found to be reduced whereas lighter elements such as F and
N are enhanced.
1. Introduction
The Sileye-3/Altein0 experiment is devoted to the investigation of the Light Flash phenomenon and the study Of
cosmic ray particle ﬂuX and composition inside the 188. This experiment follows previous ones on Mir where
relative nuclear abundances and Light Flash percepti0n[1, 2, 3] measurements have been performed. A11 nuclei
are present in cosmic rays, with Helium as the most abundant component (2 10%) after Hydrogen (: 90%)
resulting in a radiation ﬁeld much different (both in intensity and composition) than what is encountered on
Earth. Indeed, although much less abundant than protons, heavier nuclei represent the dominant component of
the equivalent dose [4]. For the determination of the equivalent dose absorbed by astronauts and the validation
of Montecarlo transport codes, it is of crucial importance to have a detailed measurement of the temporal and
orbit dependent particle rate and composition. To this purpose a number of detectors have been operating on
board spacecraft Mir, 0n the Shuttle, and are present on 188 [5, 7, 8, 9, 10, 6, 11, 12] to have a detailed picture
of the particle ﬂuence in space. Equally important is the accurate estimation of the damage to cells and the
associated risk induced by heavily charged radiation on astronauts[13, 14, 15]. Alteino has a complementary
nature to other devices as it is particularly suited to single and multiple cosmic rays detection and identiﬁcation:
in this work we present relative nuclear abundances from B to Fe measured inside 188.
2. Nuclear abundances
Sileye—3 is a cosmic ray detector composed of 8 silicon strip detector planes, each divided in 32 strips, with 2.5
mm pitch, each 380nm thick. There are 4 planes oriented along the X View and 4 planes along the Y View.
Two scintillators (1 mm thick each) are located on top and bottom of the silicon stack to provide the trigger.
Detector Characteristics are described in [16, 17, 18].
To measure relative nuclear abundances inside Pirs (Russian airlock) module we have selected single tracks
crossing the eight planes of the detector. The energy 10st E1033 in silicon has been normalized to vertical
incidence E1033 norm, according to the formula: E1033 norm, = Elosscoswmc), with Him the angle of incidence
from the normal of the silicon planes. An additional cut, requiring that the energy released in the ﬁrst and the
last planes does not differ by more than 20% and selects particles of energy Ekin Z 60 M eV/ 711. At these
energies the energy 10st in the silicon, is small if compared to the kinetic energy of the particles. The average

1The energy loss of nuclei in matter is described by the Bethe Block formula and mostly depends from Z 2 /B2, with B = 22/0 and
v the velocity of the impinging particle. The value of B of most cosmic rays selected with the above mentioned cut is close to 1, with

Low latitude region L < 2, Bottom: SAA. Note the higher abundance of protons (leftmost peaks) in the SAA and the
sharper peaks in the low latitude region due to higher energy of the particles (rigidity cutoff G > 3.875 GV) Which is
reﬂected in a smaller variation in the energy less.)
energy loss in the silicon planes is thus constant and proportional to Z 2 (the square of the electric charge).
The particle spectrum resulting from these cuts is shown in Figure 2. The leftmost and highest peak is due to
protons and helium, composing more than 95% of radiation in cosmic rays. It is possible to Clearly distinguish
the peaks from B to Si, With the Odd number nuclei more abundant than even number, as in cosmic rays. The
dynamic range of the electronics allows for nuclear detection up to As (2233), although in this dataset Ca and
Fe groups are limited by statistics. Trigger efﬁciency and silicon detector response for protons is currently
being evaluated With Montecarlo simulations. It is possible to see that nuclear identiﬁcation is possible With
this analysis method for nuclei with Z Z 5. To evaluate the relative nuclear abundances for these species we
only the less abundant component of low energy particles resulting in a higher energy release tail (For instance, 84% of Carbon nuclei in
cosmic rays have 1/32 < 1.2).

Where NZ- is the number of events of species 75, E is the energy released in the detector, mi- and 02- are the mean
value and sigma for species 73 and Ai is the normalization factor. The ﬁt was performed using Minuit (in the
ROOT framework) in groups of 4 nuclear species each for a total of 12 parameters (A), $7; and 02- for each
species 2'). This was done separately for the BCNO and FNeNaMg group: in the former case contamination
from Z < 5 elements was estimated with an exponential tail added to the ﬁtting formula, whereas contami—
nation of 0 over F was estimated by adding the 0 distribution to the ﬁtting function. Higher Z elements do
not have enough events to use this method. It was thus necessary to count the events in the expected energy
range for each nuclear group (Al, Si, Ca, Fe). Peak position was determined assuming a linear response in the
detector; the a was sealed accordingly. From this it was possible to estimate relative contamination between
groups and the resulting statistical error. In this analysis we have considered only data from two memory cards,
since in the ﬁrst one some events are saved incorrectly. This should not result in a wrong relative abundance
measurement but we are currently considering in detail this phenomenon and we will include these data in a
next analysis. The active nature of the detector allows us to study effects dependent on geographic regions.
We have divided the orbit of the space station in three regions: a) A high latitude region (time of permanence
29%) (McIlwain parameter L > 2), where the cutoff in rigidity G is lower and particle ﬂux is higher; b) The
South Atlantic Anomaly (SAA — time of permanence 13%) (geomagnetic ﬁeld B < .25G) C) The remaining
low latitude (L < 2) and high cutoff (G > 3.90V) region (time of permanence 58%). The resulting plots are
shown in Figure 1: Event though they are not normalized by the time spent in each region, it is possible to see
the higher counts in the L > 2 region (due to the lower cutoff) and the trapped protons in the SAA (more than
one order of magnitude more abundant than in other regions)
Relative abundances — normalized to carbon — are shown in Figure 2 for the whole orbit and the three regions

5%] and compared With data outside the station [19]. It is possible to see how oxygen is more abundant than carbon
E: in all regions; furthermore odd numbered nuclei such as nitrogen and ﬂuorine are enhanced (respectively by a
1%: factor 2 and 10) by nuclear fragmentation inside the station. This effect is more evident on these low abundance
L: nuclei. This phenomenon is more evident at high latitudes, Where the low energy particles are more abundant
and have a higher fragmentation cross section. It is also possible to see how the Ca group (15 g Z < 23) and
Fe group (23 g Z ) are respectively enhanced and suppressed by a factor 2 in their interaction with the station.
