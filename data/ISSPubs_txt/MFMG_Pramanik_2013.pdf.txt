Linear stability analysis of Korteweg stresses effect
on miscible viscous fingering in porous media

Viscous ﬁngering (VF) is an interfacial hydrodynamic instability phenomenon ob—

served When a ﬂuid of lower Viscosity displaces a higher Viscous one in a porous

media. In miscible Viscous ﬁngering, the concentration gradient of the undergoing

ﬂuids is an important factor, as the Viscosity of the ﬂuids are driven by concentration.

Diffusion takes place When two miscible ﬂuids are brought in contact With each

other. However, if the diffusion rate is slow enough, the concentration gradient of the

two ﬂuids remains very large during some time. Such steep concentration gradient,

Which mimics a surface tension type force, called the effective interfacial tension,

appears in various cases such as aqua—organic, polymer—monomer miscible systems,

etc. Such interfacial tension effects on miscible VF is modeled using a stress term

called Korteweg stress in the Darcy’s equation by coupling With the convection—

diffusion equation of the concentration. The effect of the Korteweg stresses at the

onset of the instability has been analyzed through a linear stability analysis using

a self—similar Quasi—steady—state—approximation (SS—QSSA) in which a self—similar

diffusive base state proﬁle is considered. The quasi—steady—state analyses available in

literature are compared With the present SS—QSSA method and found that the latter

captures appropriately the unconditional stability criterion at an earlier diffusive time

as well as in long wave approximation. The effects of various governing parameters

such as log—mobility ratio, Korteweg parameters, disturbances’ wave number, etc., on

the onset of the instability are discussed for, (i) the two semi—inﬁnite miscible ﬂuid

zones and (ii) VF of the miscible slice cases. The stabilizing property of the Korteweg

stresses effect is observed for both of the above mentioned cases. Critical miscible

slice lengths are computed to have the onset of the instability for different governing

parameters With or Without Korteweg stresses. These stabilizing properties of the

Korteweg stresses captured in this present study are in agreement With the numerical

simulations of fully nonlinear problem and the experimental observations reported in

the literature. © 2013 AIP Publishing LLC. [http://dX.doi.org/10. 1063/1 .4813403]
I. INTRODUCTION

Displacement processes in porous medium are of special interest in the ﬁelds of secondary oil
recovery in underground reservoirs, Channeling in packed columns, ﬁxed bed regeneration, Chromato—
graphic columns, groundwater contamination, etc. Extensive investigations, both theoreticallyl‘5 and
experimentally,6‘8 have been done over the decades for both miscible and immiscible Viscous ﬁn—
gering (VF) instability.9 In the former, Péclet number (Pe) plays an important role in the interfacial
instability. It is well established that the instability becomes severe as Fe value becomes larger.
The variation of Fe value directly With advection and inversely With the diffusivity signiﬁes that
advection works in favor of instability and diffusion works as a stabilizing phenomenon. On the
other hand, the Capillary number (Ca) determines the Viscous ﬁngering in case of the latter. It is
well known that When a ﬂuid of lower Viscosity displaces a higher Viscous one in a porous medium
or in a Hele—Shaw cell, the ﬂuids do not exhibit ﬂow With uniform velocity. Fingering process is
responsible for the generation of the transverse velocity components.

It was Hill6 who ﬁrst studied the Viscous ﬁngering phenomenon experimentally while displacing
sugar liquor by water from columns of granular media and explained the channeling phenomenon
qualitatively. The mathematical analysis for the linear stability was ﬁrst done by Chouke10 for
the displacement of two immiscible ﬂuids. Under the consideration that the surface tension acts
at the interface, the existence of a cutoff and a most dangerous wave number of the instability
were observed. However, their theory eXhibits that the growth constant increases with wave number
without bound, when applied to the miscible case with no surface tension and n0 diffusion, which is
physically unrealistic. Although Perrine11 brought the effect of diffusion into consideration, his form
of solution to the linear stability equations was erroneous. The reason behind this erroneousness is
the time dependence of the base state proﬁle. A considerable number of attemptslz‘14 have been
done to solve the stability problem with the account of diffusion in case of miscible ﬂuids over the
decades.

Tan and Homsy3 reVisited the problem and performed a linear stability analysis (LSA) using a
quasi—steady state method, in which the base state is assumed to be changing slowly as compared to
the growth rate of the perturbation. RousseauX er al.5 presented the linear stability analysis performed
by Tan and Homsy3 more rigorously in chromatographic column to predict the onset of instability.
Ben 61 al.15 presented a spectral theory based on the similarity transformation that appropriately
captures the coarsening dynamics for small amplitude miscible ﬁngers, which traditional quasi—
steady state analysis fails to predict properly. Most recently, Kim and Choi16 have reVisited the linear
stability problem for non—monotonic Viscosity proﬁle using a quasi—steady—state method in similarity
transformation domain and compared their ﬁndings with the quasi—steady approximation results
of Manickman and Homsy.17 The quasi—steady state results have been validated through an Eigen
analysis using a generalized Fourier series expansion solution of the perturbed equations and found
both the solutions to be in good agreement at small time. It has been reported that the self—similar
quasi—steady approximation method predicts the unconditional stability of the system for long—wave
disturbances and at an early diffusive time, which was not captured in the earlier studies3’ 17 with
classical quasi—steady state analysis.

Quasi—steady—state—approximation (QSSA) method is a very powerful technique to solve the
linearized equations obtained by linear stability analysis when the basic ﬂow, i.e., the base—state
is unsteady. It is apparent from the base state concentration relation3 Co(x, t) = H1 —|— erf(2%ﬂ)]
that it is time dependent due to the aXial dispersion. This reﬂects that the unchanged base—state in
(x, t)—d0main does not translate along the ﬂow direction as time evolves. Such a particular char—
acteristic 0f miscible ﬂuid instabilities somewhat complicates the derivation of dispersion relation
and can be overcome using QSSA method as explained by Tan and Homsy.3 On the other hand,
the base—state concentration in a similarity transformation domain (5 , t), where S = x /\/f, does not
depend on time explicitly and hence the unchanged base—state concentration proﬁle can be translated
along the ﬂow direction as time passes. This simpliﬁes the calculation of the dispersion relation.
Kim and Choi,16 in their study in (S , t) domain discussed the results for the various governing ﬂow
parameters such as log—mobility ratio R, disturbance wave numbers, etc.

In classical miscible ﬂuids, surface tension between the two ﬂuids cannot eXist at their misci—
ble interface due to the dispersive nature of the interface. However, recently Pojman er al.18 have
conducted an experiment on the International Space Station (188) and shown the existence of tran—
sient interfacial phenomena similar to that observed with immiscible ﬂuids for both the isothermal
and thermal gradient miscible ﬂuids (e.g., water—honey). In another experiment, Pojman er al.19
demonstrated with spinning drop tensiometry that an effective interfacial tension (EIT) eXists and
have measured the EIT qualitatively for systems of different miscible ﬂuids, Viz., isobutyric acid
(IBA)—water, n—butanol—water, and dodecyl acrylate—p01y(d0decy1 acrylate). Viner20 has used the
same spinning drop tensiometry to measure the EIT for IBA—water, a miscible system near the sys—
tem’s upper critical solution temperature. They have experienced that a steep concentratiorﬂthermal
gradient at the ﬂuid interface is responsible for the presence of a stress term, which acts as a body
force at the miscible interface of the system. These stresses, called Korteweg stresses,21 are the
possible sources of such effective interfacial tension, which mimics a surface tension like behavior.
To study whether Marangoni kind of convection is present in miscible ﬂuid systems, numerical

simulations have been conducted under three different cases of, (a) temperature gradient along
the transition zone, (b) variable transition zone Width, and (C) gradient in the conversion of poly—
merization by BessonOV er al.22 and Pojman er al.23 The NaVier—Stokes equations With additional
Korteweg stress term have been taken into account in absence of buoyancy—driven convection un—
der microgravity conditions. Also various authors25‘27 in the context of miscible Viscous ﬁngering
have discussed the effect of Korteweg stresses. Joseph 61 al.24 proved that in case of two ﬂuids
with different densities the velocity ﬁeld is non—solenoidal and have presented a detailed discus—
sion of the effect of Korteweg stresses on the instability. Chen et al.25 followed the same notions
and concluded that the ﬁngering 0f miscible drops may be stabilized in presence of the Korteweg
stresses. Chen and Meiburg26 have come across similar results in capillary tubes and concluded
the stabilizing effect of Korteweg stresses. More recently, Swernath er al.27 have introduced a
uniﬁed framework for the analysis of miscible and immiscible Viscous ﬁngering. They have used
the continuum theory of surface tension proposed by Brackbil er al.28 to produce a quantitative
analysis of the effect of Korteweg stresses on the Viscous ﬁngering in Chromatographic column.
The effect of Korteweg stresses has been analyzed for nonlinear interactions With the possible ef—
fect of positive and negative mobility ratio R and has been compared With the results of Mishra
etaLZ

So the question arises here is that Whether Korteweg stresses really delay the onset of instability
and have a stabilizing effect as observed in different nonlinear simulationszs‘27 However to the
authors’ knowledge, the onset of instability With the effect of the Korteweg stresses is not known in
the literature. Another important question also appears that how the onset of instability is affected
in the ﬁnite length sample as compared to the single interface case for two semi—inﬁnite domains of
miscible ﬂuids With or Without the effect of the Korteweg stresses. In order to understand the effect
of Korteweg stresses on the onset of instability With a linear stability analysis, a self—similar diffusive
base state concentration proﬁle has been used in this article under the quasi—steady state approxima—
tion. Our objective is to present a comparative result With both the quasi—steady state methods, in (x,
t) and (S , t) domains, for two semi—inﬁnite miscible solutions and relate the linear stability analysis
for a miscible ﬁnite slice of ﬂuid sandwiched between two semi—inﬁnite ﬂuid regions. The coupled
ordinary differential equations, obtained by linear stability analysis, are solved numerically using
a ﬁnite difference scheme. This leads to an eigenvalue problem With the growth rate of instability
as the eigenvalue. Dispersion relation between the growth rate of instability and the disturbances’
wave number has been calculated numerically for two semi—inﬁnite ﬂuids. The effect of the ﬁnite sam—
ple length on the onset is analyzed With and Without the effect of Korteweg stresses. We formulate the
problem and presented its LSA in Sec. II. The algorithm of the numerical method has been presented
in Sec. II D. The stabilizing effect of the Korteweg stresses on the onset of instability, the critical time
of onset are discussed in Sec. III for the two semi—inﬁnite regions. In Sec. IV, the effect of the sample
length has been presented With the determination of the critical sample length. The effect of the K0—
rteweg stresses on such lengths is also discussed in Sec. IV and concluding remarks are presented in
Sec. V.
II. PROBLEM FORMULATION
A. Physical problem

A homogeneous porous medium With constant permeability k has been considered as shown
in Fig. 1. An incompressible ﬂuid of Viscosity ,ul enters With a uniform velocity U from the left
of the domain and displaces another incompressible ﬂuid of Viscosity ,u2(>,u1). The two ﬂuids
are considered to be neutrally buoyant to avoid the density gradient instability. The sample solvent
concentration c, Which drives Viscosity u(c) 0f the ﬂuids, is assumed to be c = O and c = 62 in the
displacing and displaced ﬂuids, respectively. To bring the Korteweg stresses into consideration, it
is assumed that the ﬂuids diffuse at a slow rate so that the concentration gradient remains steep for
longer period in the thin mixing zone of the two ﬂuids.

B. Governing equations

Korteweg21 has prescribed that to model miscible ﬂuid ﬂow With steep concentration or density
gradient an extra stress term, in terms of the concentration and/or density gradient, must be added
to the momentum equation. Joseph29 has presented a detailed discussion of the dynamics of two
miscible ﬂuids With slow diffusion and gradient stresses in the context of falling drops, rising bubbles,
and plumes. Following the same theory, Hu and Joseph30 and J oseph er al.24 have considered the
Korteweg stresses into account to study the dynamics of simple mixtures and miscible liquids in
Hele—Shaw ﬂow. The stress term due to the concentration gradient of the sample solvent in two ﬂuids
appears to be of the form

T: (— §6|Vc| +§yV c)1+5Vch. (1)
Here, the two parameters y and 3 are called the Korteweg parameters. Following the continuum
theory of surface tension,27 one can write
VT = VQ(C) — vacvc], (2)
Where Q(c) is the term appearing as the coefﬁcient of the identity matrix I in the stress term T.

The problem has been modeled by coupling mass balance equation for sample solvent With a
Darcy’s law in addition to a Korteweg stress tensor for ﬂuid ﬂow velocity. The model described
above can be governed by the following equations:

Since, both the ﬂuids are incompressible, the velocity ﬁeld is solenoidal and is represented by the
conservation of mass Eq. (3). Equation (4) corresponds to the momentum equation in the form of
Darcy’s law for the ﬂow in porous media With an additional Korteweg stress term represented by
V.[6(Vc)(VC)] and this equation can be called as Darcy—Korteweg equation. The transport of solvent
is Characterized by the convection—diffusion equation, Eq. (5), in Which D is the isotropic dispersion
coefﬁcient. The pressure like term Q(C), due to Korteweg stresses, appearing in the Darcy—Korteweg
equation can be deﬁned as27

The non—dimensional governing equations are obtained by using U, D/U, D/U2 as the Char—
acteristic velocity, length, and time, respectively. The Viscosity of the displacing ﬂuid ,ul is used
to scale the Viscosity and ,ulD/k as the Characteristic pressure. The concentration of the ﬂuid is
non—dimensionalized With the concentration of the displaced ﬂuid Cg. Switching to a frame moving

The basic state of the ﬂow is assumed to have no advection (i.e., ii = 0), pure diffusion of
the concentration along the aXial direction. Hence, the time dependent base state solution of the
above equations on inﬁnite domain With the no—ﬂuX boundary conditions for the concentration is as

Where S = x/ﬁ. The base—state concentration appears to be time independent in the similarity
transformation (5 , t)—d0main, unlike its (x, t)—d0main counterpart that depends explicitly on time I
(see Eq. (17) of Ref. 3). It is to be noticed that the base—state pressure term involves time explicitly
and hence the complete base—state solution is of explicit time dependence. The relationship of the
spatial and temporal rate of changes between the (x, y, t)— and (S, y, t)—d0main at a particular

= [L(C) evolves With time due to the temporal evolution of the concentration due to the dispersion
effect. The non—dimensional equations (8)—(10) are the same equations derived by Swernath er al.27
and they investigated the Korteweg stress effects by solving the same fully nonlinear system through
a numerical method based on ﬁnite difference scheme. Here, the aim of the present paper is to study
the linear stability of such system.
C. Linear stability theory
To investigate the stability of the system, we introduce small perturbations as u = MO —|— u’,
v = v0 —|— v’, c = C() —|— c’, P = P0 —|— P’, and ,u = ,uo —|— ,u’ into the problem. The aim of the study is
to know how the disturbances from the self—similar base state at a frozen time to Change With time.
Although the base state concentration in (S, t)—d0main does not depend explicitly on time t, the base
state pressure has explicit dependency on time. Such a frozen diffusive base state can be obtained
by freezing the time t at a constant value to in the pressure term (see Eq. (14)). This directly appears
When the base state concentration is frozen at some ﬁxed diffusive time to. Further this method will
be called as self—similar quasi—steady state approximation (SS—QSSA) throughout this paper. The
resultant linear stability equations governing the small disturbances u’ , v’ , c’ , P’ , ,u’ at a frozen time

By substituting Korteweg stress parameter 6 = O, Eqs. (25) and (26) appear to be identical With
Eqs. (30) and (31) 0f Tan and Homsy.3

Observe that the system consisting of Eqs. (25 ) and (26) remains inconsistent until the Viscosity
,u is speciﬁed. Although in most of the physical situations the Viscosity—Concentration relationship
appears to be complicated haVin g no explicit mathematical expression, researchers tried to understand
the phenomena With certain simpliﬁed Viscosity proﬁles, such as m0n0t0nic3’4’9’27 (e.g., linear,
exponential, etc.) and n0n—m0n0t0nicl6’ 17 proﬁles. In this present study, an Arrhenius type of relation
of concentration dependent Viscosity proﬁle [L(C) 2 6R6 has been considered,3 Where the parameter
R, called the log—mobility ratio is deﬁned as R = ln(,uz/,ul). The associated boundary conditions
for this problem are gb, 10 —> O as S —> :1:00 or x —> :1:00 for the respective SS—QSSA and QSSA
methods, Which physically represent the decay of the perturbations at far away from the diffusive
interface.

Analytic solution of the resulting eigenvalue problem, Eqs. (23) and (24) (Eqs. (25) and (26)
in the (x, t)—d0main), for a diffusive base state proﬁle is unattainable. Hence, a numerical solution
method based on a ﬁnite difference technique is used to solve the eigenvalue problem. In Secs. II D and
III, the numerical method of solution and discussion of the obtained numerical results are presented.
D. Numerical method of solution

The domain has been discretized With number of grids n using a uniform mesh size h and the
differential equations have been approximated by the corresponding difference equations using a
central difference formula for all the derivatives appearing in the equations. Following this technique
and using the boundary conditions qbo = 100 = O and gbn+1 2 10,1“ 2 O, the ﬁnite difference
approximations of the system of equations (23) and (24) yields the following matrix equations:

the numerical methods have very good qualitative as well as quantitative matching for the QSSA
method (see Fig. 2(a)). In the case of SS—QSSA (Fig. 2(b)), the ﬁnite difference scheme predicts the
shooting method results with at most 15%—20% error. One of the most important points of stability
analysis is to determine the wave number, which corresponds to the largest growth rate of the pertur—
bations. Such critical wave number is found to be exactly same for both the numerical methods (see
Fig. 2(b)), for ﬁnite difference and shooting method. Numerical convergence of this ﬁnite difference
method has been tested with different step sizes 0.05, 0.1, 0.2 with the parameters R = 3, 6 = 0, to
= 10 and found the percentage error at most 0.02% and 0.1% for the case of QSSA and SS—QSSA,
respectively. Hence, in order to optimize the computational time and memory, the step size 0.2 has
been used throughout the computation of this paper. So it can be Claimed that the ﬁnite difference
scheme preserves the qualitative properties appropriately and have been used for the simplicity. For
the computational purpose, to capture the onset of instability for all kinds of wave numbers for both
the QSSA and SS—QSSA analyses, the miscible unstable interface at the initial time is kept at x = 0
and S = 0, respectively, with a domain ranges over — 100 to 100.
III. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION

The dispersion relation obtained by solVing Eqs. (23) and (24) numerically for R = 3 at time to
= 10 has been plotted in Fig. 2. It shows the dispersion curves for different values of the Korteweg
constant 6. Fig. 2(a) shows the dispersion relation using QSSA method, whereas the SS—QSSA
dispersion relation has been plotted in Fig. 2(b). Fig. 2 also depicts how the dispersion curves are
affected by the Korteweg stresses. It has been observed that the maximum growth rate, corresponds
to the most dangerous mode, am, is maximum for the case of 6 = 0 and it decreases as 6 increases
in magnitude. Physically, this signiﬁes that the growth rate of the fastest growing mode becomes
smaller with the increasing effect of the Korteweg stresses. This also shows that the severe most wave
number, called the most dangerous wave number, km (corresponding to am), and the cutoff wave
number kc decrease as 6 becomes more and more negative. Cutoff wave number kc corresponds
to that wave number for which the growth rate Changes from positive to negative. The average
wavelength, A = 2%, of the disturbances is nothing but the width of the ﬁngers which is deﬁned as
the average distance between the tips of two neighboring ﬁngers at onset. Fig. 2(b) shows that for
long wave disturbances, i.e., small value of k % 0.05, the system is always stable. This illustrates
that the wider ﬁngers decay faster and smoothen out soon due to the longitudinal dispersion. The
interesting phenomenon of the Korteweg stresses is that the ﬁngers, which were growing fastest
when the Korteweg stresses were not considered (Viz., at k % 0.2 and 6 = 0, see Fig. 2(b)),
coarsen and smoothen out as the Korteweg stresses are brought into consideration (see the curve
for 6 = — 10 000). These show the stabilizing effect of the Korteweg stresses. The non—dimensional
Korteweg stress parameter can lie in the range of 1—105 in magnitude when water displaces an
IBA—water mixture in which the diffusivity is of O(10_9). This corresponds to the dimensional
Korteweg stress parameter ranges from 10—11 N to 10—8 N as mentioned by Bessonov er al.22 Hence,
the present numerical computation of LSA can eXplain the qualitative stability property with the
different Korteweg parameter 6 obtained experimentally.18

In Fig. 3, comparisons of both the QSSA methods are depicted at a frozen time to = 20, for
the log—mobility ratio R = 3, Korteweg constant 6 = — 100 and — 10 000. The SS—QSSA dispersion
curves (Figs. 2(b) and 3) show that the disturbances with the wave number 0.03 f, k f, 0.13, which
was stable at an earlier time to = 10 (see Fig. 2(b)), grow and lead the system to instability at to
= 20 (see Fig. 3) for the case 6 = — 10 000. This is apparent from the fact that the maximum growth
rate am attains positive value at later time to = 20 (see Fig. 3). On the other hand, the am at to
= 20 (see Fig. 3) obtained using the QSSA method becomes smaller than that at an earlier time to
= 10 (see Fig. 2(a)). This suggests that the fastest growing ﬁngers grow at a slower rate as time
progresses. Hence, the SS—QSSA method predicts that the diffusive interface becomes unstable at
later time than that of the QSSA method prediction. Hence, it is necessary to understand that how the
perturbed quasi—steady state LSA equations (23) and (24) behave in the long—wave approximation? In

Sec. III A, we determine the analytical solutions of both QSSA and SS—QSSA eigenvalue problems,
in this long—wave approximation expansion.
A. Growth rate in long-wave approximation
Here, we present an analytical treatment to the LSA equations in the long—wave limit, i.e.,
when k << 1 to ﬁnd the growth rate. Under this long wave approximation, we are interested to
compare the numerically obtained growth rate with the analytic one. In the case of SS—QSSA, with
the assumptions of k << 1 and by eliminating the O(kz) terms from the perturbed linear stability
equations for the SS—QSSA method, Eqs. (23) and (24) reduce to

Where a A ’s are arbitrary constants. Hence, it is found that the maximum growth rate a >*‘(to) Will occur
When A = 0 and this leads to the growth rate a >*‘(t()) = — l/ (210). Hence, the growth of the disturbances
is negative in the long—wave limit. Since, the growth of the disturbances in the long—wave limit does
not depend on R and 6, hence it is expected that the growth rate Will be —l/20 = —0.05 for all
values of 6 With the diffusive time to = 10. Fig. 2(b) shows the negative growth rate for small wave
number and attains this value exactly for k = 0. However, Kim and Choi16 obtained same result
upon applying long—wave limit approximation on the linear stability equations before assuming the
quasi—steady—state theory. It signiﬁes that our present SS—QSSA method agrees exactly With the
earlier studies under the limiting case of long—wave disturbances. For the case of QSSA method of
Tan and Homsy,3 the numerical results show that the growth constant remains non—negative even
for small wave numbers. However, the same positive growth rate for QSSA method can be obtained
easily from Eqs. (25) and (26), in the limiting case of k << 1.
B. Effect of diffusive time scale on growth rate
This behavior of the dispersion curves motivates to compare the variation of the growth rate
With frozen diffusive time for both of the QSSA and SS—QSSA analyses. By Choosing two different
disturbance wave numbers, k = 0.2 and 0.3, the growth rate curves are plotted in Fig. 4, Which
shows that the QSSA and SS—QSSA methods differ at earlier frozen time, but have good agreement
at later frozen time. It is observed that the QSSA growth rate is always unstable and decreases With
to, While the SS—QSSA growth rate is stable for time interval near to % 0 and increases With to. Tan
and Homsy3 claimed that the QSSA method does not hold good for time interval near zero and
have shown that the initial value calculations (see Sec. III B of Ref. 3) give more appropriate result
for that time interval. Kim and Choi16 have also shown that SS—QSSA calculation matches With the
initial value calculations.3 Fig. 4(a) shows that for k = 0.2 and 6 = —1000 the SS—QSSA growth
rate becomes positive at time to 2, 8, i.e., the disturbances lead to an instability, While for the case k
= 0.3 and 6 = — 1000 it remains stable even at to = 10 (see Fig. 4(b)). Similar kind of properties of
the growth rate curves for 6 = 0 and —100 are also observed and that shows the disturbances With
k = 0.3 remains stable for longer time than that With k = 0.2. It is also observed that the time of
neutral stability, the time When the SS—QSSA growth rate becomes zero, moves towards the larger
values With increasing k and 6 in magnitude. In Fig. 5, the growth of the disturbances, 0*10, has
been plotted for R = 3, k = 0.2, and 6 = 0, — 100, — 1000. It characterizes that both the quasi—steady
growths are monotonic increasing function of to as shown in the linear regime, i.e., the regime in
Which the growth of the disturbance can attain a maximum value Close to 1. Therefore, it is not
expected that an unstable front Will become stable in the linear regime.

C. Korteweg stresses effect on onset of instability
These above ﬁndings motivate to 100k for the onset frozen time to for the instability, also known
as the critical time, tm-c. As 0*t0 denotes the growth of the perturbation quantities at to for some
ﬁxed value of k, the maximum of the growths for all possible wave numbers 0;“ to can represent
the maximum growth of the disturbance at that time to. Once this maximum growth becomes
positive that particular to can be assumed to be the onset time tm-C 0f the instability. The critical
frozen time 1cm has been shown for R = 3 in Fig. 6, Which Clearly reveals that the critical frozen
time moves towards larger value as 6 Changes from zero to some non—zero value. This conﬁrms the
stabilizing effect of the Korteweg stresses.
D. Comparison with nonlinear simulations
Linear stability analysis is a Widely accepted method to study the stability of any physical
system subjected to some perturbation in it. It helps to predict the onset of instability, which is
difﬁcult to capture from experiments. But in order to gain an insight of the exact dynamics, one
has to solve the complete model system by considering its nonlinear components. NOW we try to
capture the VF dynamics by performing direct numerical simulation of Eqs. (3)—(6). Following the

FIG. 7. Density plots of concentration at successive times in a frame moving at the velocity of the displacing ﬂuid with Fe
2 512 for a log—mobility ratio R = 3 (a) 6 = 0 and (b) 6 = —10 000. From top to bottom: t: 100, 300, and 500.

Fourier spectral method proposed by Tan and Homsy4 for the Classical Viscous ﬁngering problem,
we formulate the non—dimensional form of the stream—function vorticity equations similar to those
obtained by Swernath er al.27 These equations are solved for log—mobility ratio R = 3, Fe 2 512 and
different Korteweg constants 6. Numerical convergence of the simulation technique has been tested
by varying the number of spectra and time stepping.

Our aim is to understand the inﬂuences of the Korteweg stresses on the VF in the nonlinear
regime and compare the results With those obtained from the LSA. In order to Visualize such
dynamics, the density plots of concentration ﬁeld 6 is shown in Fig. 7 for the cases When the
Korteweg stress constant 6 = 0 and —104 in a reference frame moving With the dimensionless
constant speed of the unperturbed interface in a grey scale from black to White corresponding to c =
1 and c = 0, respectively. In the absence of the Korteweg stresses (6 = 0), the interface separating the
two ﬂuids becomes unstable earlier than the case When such stresses act (6 = —104) at the miscible
interface. For instance, observe that ﬁngers are formed at dimensionless time I = 300 When 6 = 0
(see Fig. 7(a)), Whereas they are yet to appear at that time When the stresses are present (see Fig.
7(b)). Furthermore, as time progresses longer ﬁngers appear for 6 = 0 than the case of 6 = —104.
Corresponding to such ﬁngering length, in Viscous ﬁngering dynamics an important measure the
mixing length Ld can be studied and that is the length of the zone Where the ﬂuids get mixed With each
other.9 It is deﬁned here as the length of the transversed averaged concentration ﬁeld E(x, l) Which
lies between 0.001 < E(x, l) < 0.999. The mixing length Ld propagates at a diffusive rate (R = 0),
i.e., Ld oc ﬂ till the ﬁngers are formedl’2 The growth of this length becomes faster With a larger
slope after the onset. The Characteristic time scale at Which Ld leaves the diffusive rate corresponds
to the onset of VF. Fig. 8 shows the mixing lengths for R = 3 for the Korteweg stresses constant 6
= 0 and — 104 along With the pure diffusive length (R = 0). It depicts that the mixing length moves
from diffusive scale to VF scale at a later time for 6 = — 104 compared to the situation of 6 = 0. This
signiﬁes that the onset is delayed by the inﬂuence of Korteweg stresses Which qualitatively agrees
With the LSA study (see Fig. 6).

IV. KORTEWEG STRESSES EFFECT ON FINITE SAMPLE

In various important applications, such as in liquid Chromatography, typically preparative or
size exclusion Chromatography, aquifers and groundwater contamination, the two ﬂuids under con—
sideration do not extend over semi—inﬁnite regions. Rather the displaced ﬂuid or the sample is
extended over a ﬁnite region and bounded With two semi—inﬁnite displacing ﬂuid regions. Recently,
Kim31 has given a linear stability analysis for the onset of Viscous ﬁngering for ﬁnite slice in porous
medium. He has discussed the effect of the ﬁnite sample length on the onset of instability. It has
been observed that depending upon the Viscosity contrast, the instability occurs for ﬁnite samples
beyond a particular length. The onset time for the instability is calculated and has been veriﬁed

With the previous works.1 Here, our aim is to study the effect of Korteweg stresses on the onset of
instability for the ﬁnite sample (see Fig. 9) to present a better understanding of the phenomenon and
its dependence on the sample size. Also the present study explains the effects of log—mobility ratio
R and disturbances’ wave number for obtaining critical sample length of miscible slices to have the
onset of VF instability.

To study the dynamics of such phenomenon, the same set of governing equations (Eqs. (3)—
(6)) 0f the two semi—inﬁnite regions, discussed in Sec. II, With a different initial condition for the
concentration have to be solved. Such an initial concentration can be expressed mathematically as
the difference of two back—to—back Heaviside functions located at a distance equal to the length of
the sample. This leads to a base—state concentration proﬁle different from the semi—inﬁnite case. So,
the base—state solution in this case is given by Eqs. (11), (13), and (14) along With the base state
concentration proﬁle

1 S S 1*
c = — erf(—) — erf(— — —)], 35
0(5) 2[ 2 2 2 < >
Where 1* = l A/E, I being the length of the sample. It can be easily veriﬁed that for the limiting case
of l —> 00 Eq. (35) reduces to Eq. (12). The eigenvalue formulation for the ﬁnite sample case is
similar to the case for two semi—inﬁnite regions. Hence, the SS—QSSA growth rate can be obtained
by solving Eqs. (23) and (24) With the base—state concentration proﬁle Eq. (35). In Sec. 111, it is
observed, although both the quasi—steady analyses give similar results for time interval away from
zero, SS—QSSA method works well even for smaller time Which the QSSA method fails to do. Hence,
SS—QSSA method has been used for further calculations to study the effect of the Korteweg stresses

on the onset of instability for ﬁnite sample. The numerical computations are performed by keeping
the unstable miscible interface at S = O in a suitably large domain including both the dispersive
fronts.

First of all, we look into the dispersion curves and the growth rate curves for ﬁnite sample in
Figs. 10 and 11 for some ﬁxed log—mobility ratio R and different Korteweg constant 6. The effect
of the sample length is Clearly observed from Fig. 10. Note that the ﬁnite sample of length l = 40
becomes unstable With 6 = —1000, Whereas the sample of length l = 15 remains stable, for all the
disturbances under the unfavorable log—mobility ratio R = 2 at frozen time to = 20. It is also noticed
that the most dangerous wave number km, most dangerous mode 0m, and the cutoff wave number
kc, all move towards the larger values With the increasing sample length. Fig. 11 shows the growth
rate curve for the case R = 3, k = 0.2, and sample length l = 10 and 15 for different Korteweg stress
constant 6. Such behaviors of the dispersion and growth rate curves motivate to study the effect
of sample length l, R, 6, and wave number k on the displacement dynamics of ﬁnite sample. The
detailed discussions of such effects are presented below.

The sample length effects on the growth rate are discussed for different parametric values of the
10 g—mobility ratio R , Korteweg constant 6, and the wave number k. No signiﬁcant relative dependence
of the sample length, l, on the stability Characteristics has been observed for to << 1. This is relevant
from the fact that the SS—QSSA growth rate attains large negative value over that interval. It is clear
from the form of the perturbation (see Eq. (22)) that the growth or decay of the disturbance quantities
solely depends on the factor 6””. Due to the strict monotonic increasing property of the exponential
function, the stability Characteristics of the system are determined by the growth function, 0*t. In

Fig. 12, growth of the disturbances 0*10, occurring at time to, has been plotted With to for different
sample length, l, and ﬁxed values of R, k, and 5. In particular, for R = 2 Fig. 12(a) shows how the
growth of the disturbances With wave number k = 0.2 varies With to in absence of the Korteweg
stresses (5 = 0). It depicts that 0*t0 always remains negative for smaller I (l f, 17). Physically, this
reveals that the narrow samples do not lead to ﬁngering instability. The diffusive front of narrow
samples diffuse out fast enough to leave the effective Viscosity ratio of the two ﬂuids so small that the
ﬁngers cannot form. Whereas Wider samples (I > 17) lead to instability for certain time interval (e.g.,
for l = 20, 0*t0 > 0 When 12 f, to f, 33). For Wider samples, it takes sufﬁciently large time for the
diffusive front to diffuse enough so that the effective Viscosity ratio becomes signiﬁcantly small such
that the ﬁngers cannot form at a later time. That is Why Wider samples lead to ﬁngering instability and
after some time those ﬁngers smoothen out due to coarsening as the effective Viscosity ratio reduces
with the diffusion of the diffusive front of the ﬁnite sample. Moreover, it is observed that for a ﬁxed
time to the growth of the sample increases With the sample size. More speciﬁcally, in Fig. 12(a), for
to = 15 growth of the sample of length l = 10 is —0.2929, Whereas that of the sample of length
l = 40 is 0.1067. The growth of the other samples of size Within the interval 10 < l < 40 lies in the
interval —0.2929 < 0*10 < 0.1067 and increases With 1. Hence, it is expected that the Widest sample
leads to ﬁngering instability at earliest. For ﬁxed value of R = 2, k = 0.2, 5 = — 100 and different I,
the growth of the disturbances has been plotted in Fig. 12(b). This reﬂects the effect of the Korteweg
stresses on the growth. It has been observed that the sample (I = 19), Which leads to instability in
the absence of the Korteweg stresses (5 = 0, Fig. 12(a)), remains stable When the Korteweg stresses
have been considered (5 = — 100, Fig. 12(b)). Physically, this reveals that the maximum Width of the
stable sample increases With the introduction of the Korteweg stresses. Most interestingly, Fig. 12(C)
depicts that as we increase the effect of the Korteweg stresses (5 = —1000) the system becomes
unconditionally stable. This Clariﬁes that the Korteweg stresses act for the stabilization of the system.

FIG. 13. The effect of the sample width 1 0n the growth 0*t0 for the case R = 3, k = 0.2, and 5 = 0.

Fig. 13 shows how the log—mobility ratio inﬂuences the growth of the disturbances. Here, we
plot the growth function for R = 3, k = 0.2, 6 = 0, which shows that the samples of length l 2 9
becomes unstable unlike for the case of R = 2, where it was stable (see Fig. 12(a)). For larger R, the
effective Viscosity ratio becomes larger which inﬂuences the disturbances to grow faster. Therefore,
the narrow samples, which were diffusing out quickly for the case of R = 2, grow to instability for
R = 3 before diffusion starts to dominate advection. The effect of the wave number has been shown
in Fig. 14. It has been recognized that the maximum length of the stable sample moves towards the
larger value (I % 12) when the wave number has been changed from 0.2 (see Fig. 13) to 0.3 (see
Fig. 14(a)). This shows that for ﬁxed R = 3, 6 = 0, and l = 10 short wave disturbances (k = 0.3)
decay to stability (see Fig. 14(a)) in contrast to the situation of relatively longer wave disturbances
(k = 0.2) that grows to instability (see Fig. 13). Fig. 15 shows that in the absence of the Korteweg
stresses for ﬁxed R = 2 short wave disturbances decay forever. This signiﬁes that due to the low
effective Viscosity ratio of the ﬂuids the diffusion of the front dominates the advection to decay such
small wave disturbances to stability. Hence, it is observed that a ﬁnite sample of particular width may
or may not lead to instability depending upon the wave number of the disturbances and the frozen
diffusive time. These inspire to predict the onset of instability of ﬁnite sample and its dependence
on the Korteweg constant, similar to that obtained for the displacement of two semi—inﬁnite ﬂuids
discussed in Sec. III C. Fig. 16 depicts that the action of the Korteweg stresses also delays the onset
of instability in the case of ﬁnite sample VF.

FIG. 15. The effect of the sample Width 1 on the growth 0*t0 for the case R = 2, k = 0.3, and 6 = 0.
A. Parametric effects on critical sample length
It is observed that depending upon certain combination of R, 6, and k, one can always ﬁnd a
critical sample length (lm-C) such that a sample of larger extent than that becomes unstable after
some time of the initial disturbances. Now we Will determine the critical sample length for ﬁxed
values of R, k, and 6. For this purpose, in Fig. 17 the maximum value of 0*10 versus the sample
length has been plotted. When (0*fo)max becomes zero, the corresponding sample length represents
lm-C for that particular R, 6, and k. This also reﬂects the effect of R and 6 on lm-C. In particular for k
= 0.2 and R = 2, Fig. 17(a) predicts lm-C for 6 = 0, — 100, and — 1000. It has been observed that lm-C
% 17 for 6 = 0 and lm-C % 19 for 6 = —100. Physically, this signiﬁes that the critical length becomes
larger With the increasing effect of the Korteweg stresses, Which was also apparent from Fig. 12. It
has also been noticed that (0*fo)max never becomes positive When 6 = —1000, Which conﬁrms the
unconditional stability of the sample of maximum possible extent. Fig. 17(b) reveals that lm-C (lm-C
% 9), for R = 3, k = 0.2, and 6 = 0, is smaller than the case of R = 2. This illustrates the growth of
the disturbances increases With R and decreases With Korteweg stresses.

B. Comparison of positive and negative R
In the above, the linear stability for the displacement of more Viscous sample by a lesser
Viscous ﬂuid has been discussed Which corresponds to the positive 10g mobility ratio R and an
unstable rear interface. However, When a less Viscous sample is displaced by a more Viscous one, the
frontal interface becomes unstable and corresponds to the negative R case. Fig. 18(a) compares the
dispersion curve for both positive and negative R in absence of the Korteweg stresses for a smaller
sample length l = 15. It is observed that for the wave number lesser than the most dangerous wave
number the corresponding growth rate is smaller for R = —2 as compared to the case of R = 2. It
is also noticed that the onset of instability occurs little earlier for the case of R = —2 than that of
the situation When R = 2 (see Fig. 18(b)). These results could be due to the ﬂow direction, Which
assists the growth of the perturbations more in case of negative R than R positive for a smaller
sample length. However, such differences of the unstable growth rate is indistinguishable even for
the smaller wave number When the length of the sample is relatively large (i.e., for l = 100, see
Fig. 19). Similar results were reported in the numerical simulations of the fully nonlinear problem to
study the effect of positive and negative R by Mishra er al.2 However, the situation is different for R
> O and R < O in the presence of Korteweg stresses. Stabilization of the system due to the Korteweg
stresses effects are more for the case of R < 0 than that of R > O. For instance, With 6 = — 100 and l
= 100 the system remains unstable With lesser growth rate than 6 = O at the frozen diffusive time to
= 10 for R = 2, Whereas it becomes completely stable for R = —2 (see Fig. 19).

V. CONCLUSION

The effect of the Korteweg stresses on the Viscous ﬁngering instability of miscible ﬂuids has
been studied using LSA. The stability equations are formulated in a similarity transformation (5 ,
t)—domain as well as (x, t)—domain for the single interface situation. We use ﬁnite difference scheme
to solve the resultant stability equations. The efﬁciency of the SS—QSSA method over the QSSA
method is established for long wave disturbances and at early time of the perturbations. The effects
of the Korteweg stresses and other ﬂow parameters such that R and k on the displacement dynamics
are presented in detail. We also perform the nonlinear simulation and results are qualitatively in
accordance With the ﬁndings of the LSA. It is found that the Korteweg stresses act against the growth
of the perturbations and stabilize the system.

The effects of the Korteweg stresses on the onset of instability for ﬁnite sample have been
analyzed by using SS—QSSA method. It is noticed that our predictions about the stabilizing effect
of the Korteweg stresses agree With the nonlinear simulations of Swernath er al.27 The effects of
the other ﬂow parameters: log—mobility ratio R, wave number k, and sample length l, on the onset
of instability have been explained Clearly. A critical sample length for the onset of instability has
been computed for different R, 6, and k. The critical length lm-C has been found to decrease When R
increases and increase With the increasing effect of the Korteweg stresses. Samples thinner than such
length may be called as Viscous thread or Viscous ﬁlament and their stability is discussed by Farmer
and Howison.32 Here, we also predict the onset time for the instability that has similar behavior
as lm-C When R and 6 are varied. The results presented in this paper not only match with nonlinear
simulations but also agree With the experimental evidences of Pojman er al.,18 Which predict that
Korteweg stresses mimic a surface tension like force at the miscible interface. Further extensive
investigation of the Korteweg stresses inﬂuence on the linear stability analysis of less Viscous slices
surrounded by more viscous ﬂuid is to be studied in comparison With its fully nonlinear simulations
and that Will be the aim of our future study.
