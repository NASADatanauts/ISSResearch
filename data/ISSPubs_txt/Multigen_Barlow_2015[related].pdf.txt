0 Background Observation of the diurnal ascent and descent of leaves of beans and other species, as well as experi—
mental interventions into these movements, such as exposures to light at different times during the movement cycle,
led to the concept of an endogenous ‘clock’ as a regulator of these oscillations. The physiological basis of leaf
movement can be traced to processes that modulate cell volume in target tissues of the pulvinus and petiole.
However, these elements of the leaf—movement process do not completely account for the rhythms that are gener—
ated following germination in constant light or dark conditions, or when plants are transferred to similar free—run—
ning conditions.
0 Scope To develop a new perspective on the regulation of leaf—movement rhythms, many of the published time
courses of leaf movements that provided evidence for the concept of the endogenous Clock were analysed in con—
junction with the contemporaneous time courses of the lunisolar tidal acceleration at the relevant experimental loca—
tions. This was made possible by application of the Etide program, which estimates, with high temporal resolution,
local gravitational Changes as a consequence of the diurnal variations of the lunisolar gravitational force due to the
orbits and relative positions of Earth, Moon and Sun. In all cases, it was evident that a synchronism exists between
the times of the turning points of both the lunisolar tide and of the leaftide when the direction of leaf movement
changes. This ﬁnding of synchrony leads to the hypothesis that the lunisolar tide is a regulator of the leaftide, and
that the rhythm of leaf movement is not necessarily of endogenous origin but is an expression of an exogenous luni—
solar ‘Clock’ impressed upon the leaf—movement apparatus.
0 Conclusions Correlation between leaftide and Etide time courses holds for leaf movement rhythms in natural con—
ditions of the greenhouse, in conditions of constant light or dark, under microgravity conditions of the International
Space Station, and also holds for rhythms that are atypical, such as pendulum and relaxation rhythms whose periods
are longer or shorter than usual. Even the apparently spontaneous short—period, small—amplitude rhythms recorded
from leaves under unusual growth conditions are consistent with the hypothesis of a lunisolar zeitgeber. Two hy—
potheses that could account for the synchronism between leaftide and Etide, and which are based on either quantum
considerations or on Classical Newtonian physics, are presented and discussed.
Key words: Biological clock, Canavalia ensiformis, gravitational force, kymography, leaf movements, lunisolar
tidal acceleration, Phaseolus coccineus, pulvinus, zeitgeber.

FIG. 1. Interplay of exogenous and endogenous timing mechanisms upon an organism. Rhythmic physico—chemical features of the external environment that are com—
ponents of the biotic complex (light, temperature, food) can be intercepted by plants by means of speciﬁc receptors which transduce and integrate the biophysical
properties into the network of metabolism. The rhythmic nature of these features then becomes translated into physiological rhythms (outer ring of the diagram) that
can be adjusted in accordance with the capture and summation of the relevant inﬂow of physico—chemical units. The inner ring of the diagram represents a second
class of external environmental variables that are components of the Earth’s geophysical ﬁelds. These ﬁelds cannot be altered and may not show predictable long—
term rhythms and therefore there may be no speciﬁc receptor designated for their transduction. The response to them is direct, according to physical principles, even
if these are presently not fully understood. The adjustable physiological rhythms and the more rigorous geophysically dependent rhythms both feed into (arrows) and
participate in the liVing processes and behaViour of the organism, represented by the circular ‘core’ of the diagram. It is possible, however, that should a geophysical
rhythm extend from one day to the next, its consequences, which may be mediated by the organism itself, might then be brieﬂy integrated as an adjustable physiolog—
ical rhythm (J —shaped arrows). However, given the variable, or arrhythmic nature of geophysical in—ﬂows, integration is short—lived and supplanted by the in—ﬂow of
novel information. The ﬁgure is based on ﬁg. 2 in Brown (1964), but with much modiﬁcation.

FIG. 2. Kymographic record of the height (L) of leaf P16 of young plants of Canavalia ensiformis over a 4—d period, during November 1924, commencing at Last
Quarter (LQ) Moon (lunar day 23). Units of L are arbitrary. The corresponding Etide trace (:5g) is shown in the top panel, together with an indication of the tidal
structure of double [AB] and single [A] peaks, the latter being the singular peak which occurs on a day close to LQ Moon. Vertical arrows indicate the correspon—
dences between the time course of the Etide 5g and features of the leaftide L, notably the times of their respective turning points. The two middle panels 5L show the
hourly rates of leaf movement, up or down, for leaf P16, and for leaf P15 of a replicate plant. Short vertical arrows associated with the two 5L traces indicate turning
points in the respective leaftides. The numeral beside each arrow indicates the degree of displacement between a leaftide turning point and an Etide turning point. A
zero (0) indicates the two turning points are synchronous, and values of —1, +1, etc. (h) indicate displacements of the leaftide turning points with respect to those of
the Etide. The houly rate of change of the Etide values [5(5g)] is shown in the lower panel. The correspondence of the Etide turning points [when 5(5g) : 0] with the
leaftide traces (5L) is emphasized by vertical lines linking the traces in the respective 5(5g) and 5L panels. The short horizontal bar on the trace for 5(5g) at 19—20/
11 indicates a small range of values around zero which might serve as an effective threshold at the Etide turning point in relation to a leaftide turning point. The
lower horizontal time—scale supports open bars, which represent the times between moonrise and moonset, and ﬁlled bars, which represent the times between sunset
and sunrise (i.e. ﬁlled bars span the night period). Time of day, date, lunar day number and year constitute the horizontal time aXis. The leaf trace data have been
redrawn from ﬁgs 4 and 5 in Brouwer (1926). In the original ﬁgures, leaf heights are presented in an inverted fashion; but here the orientation is as indicated, with
the descended ‘down’ position and the ascended ‘up’ position of the leaf conforming to the vertical orientation of the Figure. Plants were raised in a greenhouse.
