The bone mineral density (BMD) of astronauts decreases speciﬁcally in the weight-bearing sites
during spaceﬂight. It seems that osteoclasts would be affected by a change in gravity; however,
the molecular mechanism involved remains unclear. Here, we show that the mineral density of
the pharyngeal bone and teeth region ofTRAP-GFP/Osterix-DsRed double transgenic medaka ﬁsh
was decreased and that osteoclasts were activated when the ﬁsh were reared for 56 days at the
international space station. In addition, electron microscopy observation revealed a low degree of
roundness of mitochondria in osteoclasts. In the whole transcriptome analysis,ﬂ(bp5 and ddit4 genes
were strongly up-regulated in the ﬂight group. The ﬁsh were ﬁlmed for abnormal behavior; and,
interestingly, the medaka tended to become motionless in the late stage of exposure. These results
reveal impaired physiological function with a change in mechanical force under microgravity, which
impairment was accompanied by osteoclast activation.
It is considered that gravity is a key factor playing roles in the tissue construction1 and remodeling of
3 bone“. The nature of the microgravity environment has led us to assume that alteration of external
forces leads to imbalance of static sense, cell activity, and physiology. In fact, the BMD of astronauts
5 is known to decrease“, suggesting that osteoclasts and osteoblasts would be affected by a change in
gravitys. Recently, it was reported that bisphosphonate treatment coupled with exercise protected against
5 bone loss in humans during long—duration spaceﬂight6, indicating that osteoclasts are activated under
microgravity. However, the mechanisms are unclear; and most in vivo studies did not show clear changes
5 in osteoclast number or activity during spaceﬂight7.
In this present study, to examine the cellular activities related to bone formation and resorption in a
g microgravity environment during animal growth, we utilized the growth of bones of transgenic medaka
ﬁsh from the juvenile to adult stage in an experiment conducted in space. We mainly examined the
g pharyngeal region where many osteoclasts are f0und8, which region contains several hundreds of teeth
in the adult ﬁsh and is highly sensitive to gravity because of this high density of teeth in this area.
3 The ﬁsh were ﬁlmed for abnormal behavior during their 60 days of being systematically reared under
microgravity. We found that the mineral density of the pharyngeal bone and teeth of the medaka ﬁsh
3 decreased and that osteoclasts were activated when the ﬁsh were reared for 56 days at the international
space station (188). In the whole transcriptome analysis of jaw tissue from medaka reared for 60 days at

in the ﬂight group. In addition, we found enhanced expression of 15 mitochondrion—related genes; and
electron microscopy observation revealed a low roundness of mitochondria in the osteoclasts. Thus, our
study provides a new insight regarding the regulation of bone loss under microgravity.
Results
Generation of osteoclast- and osteoblast-reporter ﬁsh. Firstly, we established TMP promot—
er—GFP/Osterix promoter—Dsred double transgenic medaka ﬁsh for this experiment, because osteoclasts
and osteoblasts in addition to tooth buds in the pharyngeal region are diVided by 2 ﬂuorescent signals
in this transgenic line. Twenty—four candidate ﬁsh of 16mm in total length (6 weeks after hatching)
were selected from 312 ﬁsh by 3 criteria: no sickness, same size with growth and good Vision. These 24
candidate ﬁsh were transported into space and reared for 2 months in the AQH (Aquatic Habitat) in the
“Kibo” section of the ISS. RNAs were isolated from 8 ﬁsh at day 0, and from 4 ﬁsh at day 60, after the
start of rearing in the AQH; and 6 ﬁsh were ﬁxed with PFA at day 14 and 6 ﬁsh at day 56 by the help of
astronauts in the ISS (Supplementary Table 1).
Medaka ﬁsh behaviors under microgravity. Unique behaviors of the medaka ﬁsh in the AQH
were ﬁlmed during 2 months to observe their adaptation to the microgravity environment (Fig. 1A).
Observation at day 0, immediately after transport to the AQH, showed that the ﬁsh swam gently and
seldom displayed “looping behavior,” i.e., swimming in tight circles, indicating that the ﬁsh had the
capacity to adapt to the microgravity environment (Supplementary Movie 1). At day 14, before being
ﬁxed with PFA the ﬁsh swam vertically and looped, showing an upside—down behaVior that seemed
to indicate that they were trying to assume an appropriate posture under microgravity for eating or
swimming (Supplementary Movie 2). At day 27, the ﬁsh could be induced to mate successfully under
microgravity (Supplementary Movie 3). Interestingly, the medaka tended to become motionless at day 47,
suggesting that they behaved like animals haVing hypokinesia (Supplementary Movie 4). These movies
demonstrated speciﬁed unusual behaViors for adaptation to microgravity, suggesting that physiological
changes had occurred in the ﬂight ﬁsh just as in astronauts.
Flight ﬁsh group shows normal growth. For examination of bone tissues, medaka ﬁsh were
ﬁxed with 4% paraformaldehyde at days 14 and 56 (Fig. 1B). The measurement of total length (5 days
before rearing and 14 days and 56 days after the start of rearing) showed the same growth tendency
between the ground and ﬂight groups (Fig. 1C). With respect to the development of pharyngeal teeth,
there was a slightly lower number of teeth at day 14, but almost the same number at day 56, in the
microgravity—exposed medaka than in the ground group (Supplementary Fig. 1), suggesting that tooth
development in terms of tooth germ formation was normal in the ﬂight group.
Mineral density was decreased during 56 days under microgravity. For evaluation of mineral—
ization under microgravity, soft X—ray analysis of whole ﬁsh was performed (Fig. 2A). In the ﬂight ﬁsh
group at day 56, the calciﬁed area (white signals) in the pharyngeal bone region was decreased, compared
with that for the ground control (Fig. 2B,C); whereas there was no signiﬁcant difference in calciﬁcation
at day14 (Supplementary Fig. 2). The mineral density of the upper pharyngeal bone and the tooth region
showed an approx. 24% decrease in the pQCT analysis, compared with that for the ground control
(Fig. 2D; ground control: 129.417i 13.904 mg/cm3 n: 6, ﬂight: 98.14i 19.265 mg/cm3 n: 5, p < 0.05).
In addition, uCT imaging showed thinner bone in the ﬂight medaka (Fig. 2E). Regarding the vertebral
bones, their BMD was slightly decreased (Supplementary Fig. 3). In addition, in another calciﬁed area,
the BMD of otoliths showed no signiﬁcant difference between the ﬂight and the control samples (data
not shown).
Osteoclast volume was increased during 56-day ﬂight. Since TRAP is a marker of osteoclasts
and osterix is a marker of osteoblasts, the whole upper and lower pharyngeal bones at day 56 were
imaged by confocal laser scanning microscopy (Fig. 3A,B); and the volumes of ﬂuorescent TMP—GFP
and Osterix—DsRed were measured by use of software, because the cell volume is an important parameter
for resorption capacity in addition to the surface area of resorption, according to theoretical calculation
of cell fusion and bone resorptive capacity“). According to the quantitative analysis of GFP (Fig. 3C,D)
and DsRed (Fig. 3E,F) volumes, the GFP volume was particularly increased in the ﬂight group. The
osteoclast volume was normalized by the osteoblast volume, because the sizes of pharyngeal bones var—
ied, with the result being that the relative ratio of the GFP volume diVided by the DsRed volume was
increased during ﬂight (Fig. 3G,H). This ﬁnding indicated that the osteoclast volume in the ﬂight medaka
had increased over that of the osterix—expressing osteoblastic cells. However, ﬂuorescent imaging of the
vertebral body showed only a slight but no signiﬁcant enlargement of osteoclasts (Supplementary Fig. 4).
Next, to examine the ﬂuorescence intensity and the area of osteoclasts and osteoblastic cells in the upper
pharyngeal bone, we performed double immunostaining by using anti—GFP and anti—DsRed antibodies
(Fig. 31). The relative ﬂuorescence intensity calculated from the ratio of osteoclast signals diVided by
osteoblastic signals in the ﬂight group at day 56 was increased by 50.4% over that for the ground group
(Fig. 3]), and the relative area of ﬂuorescence calculated from the osteoclast area diVided by osteoblastic

other hand, only the ﬂuorescence intensity in the ﬂight group was increased at day 14 (Supplementary
Fig. 5). Whole 3D reconstruction of serial sections indicated the enhancement of GFP signals in the ﬂight
group of medaka (Supplementary Movie 5). Because osteoclasts become mature by cell fusion, we deter—
mined the numbers of several types of GFP—positive osteoclasts haVing different numbers of nuclei, e.g., 1
nucleus (mononuclear), 2 nuclei per cell (Fig. 3L), 10 nuclei per cell (Fig. 3M), etc. and counted the num—
ber of TRAP—GFP—positive cells containing each of these numbers of nuclei (Fig. 3N and Supplementary
Table 2). This result indicated that multi—nucleation was increased under microgravity, although the total
number of nuclei showed no signiﬁcant difference between the ground and ﬂight groups (Fig. 30). 3D
imaging showed enhancement of osteoclast ﬂuorescent signals throughout the whole area of upper and
lower pharyngeal bones in the ﬂight group (Supplementary Movie 6).
The ﬂight group showed an increased area of TRAP staining and mitochondrial abnormality
in osteoclasts. Next, to detect the enzymatic actiVity responsible for bone resorption, we performed
TRAP staining of the lower pharyngeal bone at day 14 (Supplementary Fig. 6A—H). The TRAP—positive
area expressed as unit area was increased in the ﬂight group (Supplementary Fig. 61). 3D imaging of
TRAP—stained specimens showed dynamic bone resorption in the ﬂight group (Supplementary Fig. 7).
Furthermore, lower pharyngeal bones at day 56 were sectioned and stained for TRAP actiVity and with
Von Kossa to examine the proportion of bone resorption per area of bone mineralization (Fig. 4A). The
result showed an increase in this relative ratio (Fig. 4B); and 3D imaging of the ﬂight group revealed
an accumulation of TMP—positive areas, indicating that large osteoclasts were present there (Fig. 4C;
Supplementary Movie 7). This ﬁnding was consistent with the increased area of GFP—positive cells in the
lower pharyngeal bone of the ﬂight group found by 3D imaging (Supplementary Fig. 8). Consequently,
a gap in the von Kossa staining was found, suggesting possible dissolution of minerals from the bones
(Fig. 4C). Next, to examine the morphological change in organelles of osteoclasts, we performed electron
microscopic analysis. Our results showed that the mitochondria in osteoclasts showed a low degree of
roundness in the jaw of ﬂight—group (Fig. 4D and Supplementary Fig. 9).
Osteoblastic activity tended to decrease in the ﬂight group. For study of the molecular mech—
anism of bone loss during the ﬂight period, RNAs were extracted from the medaka jaw at day 60; and
transcriptome analysis after cDNA sequencing was performed; because, unfortunately, RNAs extracted
from the pharyngeal bone appeared to have undergone degradation because it was difﬁcult to preserve
tissues at the back side of the throat by using RNAlater. Bones in the j aw as well as teeth were remodeled
by osteoclasts and osteoblasts, similar to the remodeling in the pharyngeal bone (Supplementary Fig.
10). According to our results, the expression of osteoblastic genes including those for asterix and type
I collagen was decreased (Supplementary Table 3). Consistently, azan staining showed a tendency for a
decrease in the amount of collagen in the matrix in the ﬂight group (Supplementary Fig. 11), although
osteoblast morphology examined by electron microscopy showed no difference between the ground— and
ﬂight—group medaka (Supplementary Fig. 12). In addition, the expression levels of RANKL and NFATCI
were not signiﬁcantly increased (data not shown), suggesting that osteoclasts in the ﬂight—group medaka
had not been activated with the support of osteoblasts.
Signals under shear stress-like force were increased in day 56 ﬂight group. To ﬁnd inﬂuence
of the abnormal mitochondria structure in osteoclasts, we examined mitochondrion—related molecules
including those of the glucocorticoid receptor (GR) pathwayll’lz. In the transcriptome sequencing, fkbp5
and ddit4 were found to be the genes with the highest elevation at the transcriptional level during ﬂight;
and, interestingly, fkbp5 was strongly and broadly induced in many organs such as scales, a part of the
trunk, brain, liver, ovary, and intestines (Dr. Mitani, personal communication) as well as in the jaw
in the ﬂight group, which elevated transcription was conﬁrmed by RT—PCR analyses (Supplementary
Table 3 and Fig. 5A,B). fkbp5 and ddit4 are known as molecules in the downstream of the GR9, and it
is reported that GR is activated by shear stress”. Since phosphorylation of FAK is up—regulated by shear
stress”, we examined its phosphorylation state in osteoclasts by using anti—phosphorylated FAK (pFAK)
and determined the osteoclast area with anti—GFP antibodies (Fig. 5C). pFAK signals were normalized
by dividing by the GFP—positive area (Fig. 5D,E), and the results indicated enhanced pFAK signaling
during the ﬂight period. This result suggested that microgravity generated stress in the ﬂight group. In
addition, 15 mitochondrion—related genes were signiﬁcantly up—regulated at least 1.2—fold compared with
their expression in the ground controls (P < 0.05; Supplementary Table 3); and also the expression of 5
osteoclast—related genes, i.e., cebpb, fosll, fosB, c-fos, and junb-b was increased at least 1.5—fold compared
with that for the ground controls (P < 0.05; Supplementary Table 3). These results indicated enhanced
mitochondrial biogenesis in the activated osteoclasts in the ﬂight—group medaka.
Discussion
We investigated alteration of osteoclast potency between the ﬂight medaka group and the ground con—
trol in terms of osteoclast volume calculated from the green ﬂuorescent signals in osteoclasts, anti—GFP
antibody—positive area by immunostaining, and enzymatic actiVity by TRAP staining. A11 3 of these meth—
ods revealed osteoclast activation in the pharyngeal bone region. The number of multinucleate osteoclasts

was increased in the ﬂight medaka at day 56, whereas the total number of nuclei in GFP—positive cells
showed no signiﬁcant difference, indicating that osteoclast differentiation was not enhanced but that
the osteoclast fusion process was promoted under microgravity during the 56—day period. These results
showed the activation of osteoclasts that were already localized at bone surface in spaceﬂight, consistent
with the report that the BMD of astronauts decreases speciﬁcally in the weight—bearing sites, more local
remodeling sites regulated by osteoclasts3.

Although there is a report showing mitochondrial alteration in a human lymphocyte cell line during
spaceﬂight”, no results indicating such an effect in vivo or in osteoclasts have been reported. Presently
we found mitochondrial abnormalities of jaw tissues in the ﬂight group, which abnormalities included
up—regulation of mitochondrial genes and a low degree of mitochondrial roundness, as a change in orga—
nelle morphology, in osteoclasts. Recently, it was reported that ATP in osteoclast mitochondria coordi—
nately regulates osteoclast survival and bone resorption”. Consistently, the phenotype of the ﬂight group

As previously reported, spaceﬂight leads to a decrease in the number and activity of osteoblasts”. In our
results, osteoblasts were also slightly inactivated; although no signiﬁcant changes in the roundness 0f
osteoblast mitochondria were observed (data not shown), indicating that osteoclasts were more affected
than osteoblasts by a change in gravity.

In the transcriptome analysis, we found up—regulation 0ffkbp5 and ddit4 genes in the downstream
of the glucocorticoid receptor (GR)9. It was earlier reported that GR and its transcriptional signaling
pathway are activated by shear stress”. Consistently, our results showed enhancement of the pFAK
level, which is known to be increased by shear stress through the integrin signaling pathway14 in osteo—
clasts, suggesting that osteoclasts were regulated by shear stress—like force speciﬁed under microgravity.
Although genetic studies have mainly identiﬁed FKBPS as playing a role in depressive illness”, and an
in vitro study showed that FKBPS overexpression in osteoclasts induces up—regulation of bone resorp—
tion and that the fkbpS gene expression level in osteoclasts is increased by glucocorticoid treatment”.
Regarding the role of DDIT4 in bone biology, it was reported that hypoxia—inducible factors including
DDIT4 regulate osteoclast—mediated bone resorption”; and in a study on for bone substrate—related bone
resorption by osteoclasts, the gene expression levels offkbp9 and ddit4 were found to be up—regulated
in 0ste0c1asts21. Furthermore, various forms of stress induce FKBPS 0r DDIT422’23. Taken together, our
results suggest that, under microgravity in spaceﬂight, the change in microenvironment speciﬁcally
around bones where osteoclasts are in close proximity induces morphological alteration of osteoclast
mitochondria, which activates the GR pathway controlling FKBPS and DDIT4 expression for enhance—
ment of osteoclast multi—nucleation. In the future, we hope to perform again space experiments to clarify
the mechanism in more detail.

Medaka ﬁsh were ﬁlmed for abnormal behaviors to consider a physiological change under micro—
gravity. The movies showed that the ﬁsh became accustomed to life under microgravity by displaying
unique behaviors such as upside—down, vertical, and tight—circle swimming. In addition, we found that
the mating behavior at day 33 under microgravity was not different from that on the earth, indicating
that the medaka ﬁsh had adapted to their microgravity environment. We found a motionless behavior
at day 47, an interesting phenotype of adaptation under microgravity. In fact, spaceﬂight poses chronic
stress to animals, which impairs physiological function; and it reduces mechanical use, inducing hypo—
dynamia and hypokinesia. Such effects suggest the presence of some main factor leading to bone loss
under microgravity, which situation is similar to disuse osteoporosis 0n the ground.

Taken together, our results indicate impaired physiological function and reduced mechanical use
under microgravity, as well as osteoclast activation as an effect of stress speciﬁed by microgravity. The
results of our present study provide a better understanding of the response of bone to reduced gravity
and shed light on the mechanism underlying the regulation of bone physiology under microgravity.
Methods
Medaka Fish. Cab, an inbred wild—type strain of the medaka (O. latipes), was used for this study. The
experiments were performed in accordance with policies and protocols approved by the Japan Aerospace
Exploration Agency (IAXA) Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee. The ﬁsh were kept under a
photoperiod 0f 14—h light/IO—h darkness at 28°C. Eggs were obtained by random crossing and kept at
the same temperature just indicated. Embryos were incubated at 28°C after collection. After hatching,
larvae were incubated at room temperature. Earlier we established double transgenic medaka by mating
a TMP—GFP line for Visualizing osteoclasts24 with an OsteriX—DsRed line for Visualizing osteoblasts25’26
and utilized the heterozygous medaka of this double transgenic line.

The medaka ﬁsh were ﬂown on a Space—shuttle in 1994, mated, and maintained for 15 days in the
second International Microgravity Laboratory”. As for medaka osteoclasts, we previously reported that
multinucleate osteoclasts are localized at the region of the pharyngeal teeth8, in which osteoclasts are
Visualized by using a TRAP promoter—GFP transgenic line for studying bone resorption during bone
remodeling“. Furthermore, osteoblasts are Visualized by using an OsteriX promoter—DsRed transgenic
line25.

Selection of medaka. Totally 312 medaka 0f the TRAP—GFP/OsteriX—DsRed double transgenic line
with a similar level of growth, conﬁrmed with reference to scale growth, were carried into the Baikonur
Space Station and reared up to a total length of 16mm from the tip of the head to the tip of the caudal
ﬁn. During this time, we checked the growth level in terms of total length, and kept those ﬁsh with higher
growth as a group in the same tank. Finally, we examined the sight of medaka by using a rotation appa—
ratus, with the sight being evaluated by 4 judges who classiﬁed the medaka into 4 grades of sight level.
Among the ﬁsh (6 weeks after hatching), 16 were chosen for long—term rearing in the International Space
Station (188) and 8 others were additionally chosen as an mRNA source just after arriving at the 188. On
Oct 23 of 2012, Soyuz (assigned as 328) was launched at 10:51 (GMT) from Baikonur.
Optomotor response test. The Visual test was performed according to an earlier ﬂight experiment
using medaka ﬁsh”. The ﬁsh were placed in a circular tank with a rotating wall painted with vertical
stripes of black and white colors. When the wall rotates, the ﬁsh have a tendency to follow the stripes
and thus swim around the tank. Fish with good Vision keep swimming around the tank even when the

"10","wall rotates very quickly, whereas ﬁsh with a poor Vision soon see the rotating stripes as a blur and stop
moving”.

Rearing system. The aquatic habitat was developed by the IAXA based on the aquatic animal facil—
ities for Space Shuttle use29‘31. This aquatic habitat is used to rear small freshwater ﬁsh such as medaka
0r zebraﬁsh up to 90 days in space. The habitat was composed of a closed water circulation system that
included a water circulation unit, gas exchanger for exchange of dissolved gas in the circulation water,
a biological ﬁlter for water puriﬁcation, and 2 aquariums as habitats for the ﬁsh. The water circulation
unit included water pumps, ﬂow sensors, a temperature controller, and an accumulator to control the
environment for ﬁsh habitation. The total water volume of the water circulation system was 3.2L, and
the water volume of each aquarium was 0.7L. The aquarium had an automatic feeder to supply artiﬁcial
powdery food to the ﬁsh. Also, each aquarium was equipped with an LED light for producing day and
night cycles and a CCD camera for observation of the ﬁsh. Outlines 0f the aquatic habitat and a ﬂow
schematic are shown in the IAXA homepage32. These components were assembled in the Multi—purpose
Small Payload Rack (MSPR) in the Japanese Experiment Module (IBM) in 188.

During ﬁsh habitation in the aquatic habitat, the water temperature was kept at 255—26 °C, and the

water ﬂow rate was controlled at 0.1 L per a minute for each aquarium. The dissolved oxygen was main—
tained at over 90% saturation by gas exchange with the cabin, and the water quality was controlled by
using a biological ﬁlter of nitrifying bacteria. The water quality was checked by the astronauts once or
twice in a week by using test strips, and there was no accumulation of either ammonia or nitrite during
the experiments. The day and night cycle, obtained by use of a white LED light, was controlled to be
14 hrs as light (3801uX) and 10 hrs as dim light (101uX; this dim light was used for dorsal light response
of ﬁsh). Three kinds of powdery food, Otohime B—l (Marubeni Nisshin Feed) and Kyowa N250 and
N400 (Kyowa Hakko Bio), were supplied to the ﬁsh by an automatic feeder in the aquarium twice or 3
times a day.
Sample transport and ﬁxation condition. Medaka ﬁsh were placed in a “Fish Carrier” and ﬂown
on Soyuz ﬂight TMA—06M (Roscosmos, Russia). After arrival at KIBO, the space laboratory of Japan
in the International Space Station (188), the medaka were transported to the “Aquatic Habitat (AQH)”
in the “Multipurpose Small Payload Rack (MSPR)” for on board rearing. With consideration of the
dorsal light response of ﬁsh, the lighting was achieved from the upper side in the tank. The feed was
automatically dispensed from the underside of the tank. A ﬁlter was used to clarify the water automati—
cally. Subsequently, at selected times ﬁsh were caught by a “Fish Catcher” and transported into the “Fish
Fixation Apparatus” for analysis of histology 0r mRNA expression.

Initially, 8 ﬁsh were reared in each aquarium. Fourteen days after the start of rearing, 6 ﬁsh were
anesthetized with ethyl 3—amin0benzoate methanesulfonate salt (tricaine) and ﬁxed with PFA (paraform—
aldehyde), washed 3 days later, and then stored at 4°C in a refrigerator in 188. These 6 sampled ﬁsh were
brought to the earth by Soyuz 0n NOV. 19 of 2012. Fifty—siX days after the start of rearing, another 6 ﬁsh
were sampled for PFA ﬁxation, washed 4 days later, and then stored at 4°C. In addition, 60 days after
rearing had begun, the remaining 4 ﬁsh were treated with RNAlater (Sigma—Aldrich, MO, USA), and
stored at —95 °C in 188. After the return to earth, PFA—ﬁxed specimens were rinsed several times and
stored in cacodylate buffer. These specimens were maintained at 4°C or —95 °C throughout experiments
and transited from Moscow to Japan. Under Vivarium conditions, the same numbers of ﬁsh were sampled
on the ground as control samples in the same time—course experiment. This ﬂight—synchronous (control)
group was kept under conditions identical to those of the ﬂight group except for spaceﬂight.
Monitoring of ﬁsh behavior. For comparison of the behavior between the ground control and
ﬂight medaka, movies were recorded 2 0r 3 times each day by use of a CCD camera during the 60—day
experiment.

Sof'l: X-ray. Whole medaka ﬁsh were subjected to soft X—ray imaging (Sofron sro—M50, Sofron (30.,
ltd. Tokyo. Japan). The intensity of the white signal was measured by use of software (ImageI). The gray
values of the pharyngeal bone region were corrected by the background of the inner head region.
Radiological assessments of the pharyngeal bone and vertebrae. Three—dimensional (3D)
reconstruction images of pharyngeal bones and vertebrae were obtained by using image analysis software
(TRI/3D—View, Ratoc System Engineering, Tokyo, Japan) to analyze the data obtained by micro—focal
computed tomography (u—CT; ScanXmate—E090 [147 uA, 48 kV]; Comscan, Kanagawa, Iapan)33’34. Some
of the pharyngeal bone samples were analyzed as higher—resolution images obtained by using a SCANCO
Medical uCT 35 System (145 uA, 55 kV; Nippon Denshi—Scanco Medical, Briittisellen, Switzerland) haV—
ing an isotropic voxel size of 3.5 um35. The image slices were reconstructed and analyzed for obtaining
the focal average thickness by using Scanco uCT Version 6.1 software (Nippon Denshi—Scanco Medical).
The bone mineral density (BMD) of the whole pharyngeal bone and vertebrae was measured by use
of peripheral quantitative computed tomography (pQCT; XCT Research SA+; Collimation B, Stratec
Medizintechnik GmbH, Pforzheim, Germany). We set up a new standard for measuring the BMD of
medaka vertebrae, since their mineral content is much lower than that of rodent bones; and, therefore
SCIENTIFIC REPORTS |5:14172| DOI:1o.1o38/srep14172 10

"
"11","the standard value of 690 mg/cm3 for separating cortical bones from trabecular bones could not be used.
The mineral bone density was recognized as a bone segment having a focal bone mineral density of more
than 100 mg/cm3.

In the statistical analysis, all data were presented as the meansi standard deviation (SD). Statistical
comparisons were performed by use of the unpaired t—test. The difference was considered signiﬁcant at
p < 0.05.

Whole-tissue imaging for measurement of cell volume. The specimens ﬁxed with PFA were
equilibrated with 80% glycerol. The ﬂuorescent images were collected by a laser—scanning confocal
microscope (Olympus, Center Valley, PA; FV1000). The interval of all continuous images was Zum in
the pharyngeal bone and vertebral body. The range of each tissue was adjusted enough to contain the
ﬂuorescence of tissues. The upper pharyngeal bones at day 56 were covered with 130 slices; and the lower
pharyngeal teeth and bone at day 56, with 140 slices. The vertebral body at day 56 was covered with 90
slices. The volumes of GFP and DsRed expressing cells were calculated by use of Volocity Demo (Perkin
Elmer). We avoided the pigment ﬂuorescent signals as the background.

Technovit sections for TRAP staining and von Kossa staining. After completion of CLSM exam—
ination, a pair of lower pharyngeal bones with attached teeth was collected from each medaka and
divided into left and right halves. These specimens were dehydrated through an ascending series of
ethanol, embedded in Technovit 7100 (Heraeus Kulzer GmBH, Wehrheim/Ts., Germany), and polymer—
ized at ice—cold temperature. Cured Technovit blocks of lower pharyngeal bones and teeth were serially
cut into 4—um—thick sections and processed for von Kossa staining“. The sections were further stained
for histochemical demonstration of tartrate—resistant acid phosphatase (TMP) actiVity by the Azo—dye
method at pH 5.8 (30—45 min at 37°C). Standardized digital photomicrographs of pharyngeal bones
and teeth in serial sections were collected, and the surface areas (pixel numbers) of von Kossa—positive
structures (Kossa area) and TMP—positive structures (TMP area) were respectively counted by using a
computer software (Photoshop 7.0 or CS5 Extended, Adobe, USA). The pixel ratio of Kossa/TMP areas
was calculated for the group reared for 56 days. In the group reared for 14 days, on the other hand, the
pixel ratio of TMP area/whole unit area of measurement was calculated. The pharyngeal bones and teeth
of normal medaka, maintained through identical time schedules and feeding conditions under normal
gravity were similarly processed and examined as above and served as the control. von Kossa—positive
mineralized structures and TMP—positive osteoclasts were reconstructed into 3D images by using a
computer software, DeltaViewer37.

Histology of parafﬁn sections. One half of a pair of upper pharyngeal bone and teeth from each
ﬁsh was decalciﬁed in neutralized 10% ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA) solution for 1 week at
4°C prior to paraﬂin embedding and sectioning.

For immunohistochemistry, the following primary antibodies were used: goat anti—GFP Abs
(FITC—labeled) at 1:1000 (abcam, ab6662), rabbit anti—DsRed Abs at 1:1000 (Living Colors, 632496) and
rabbit anti—pFAK Abs at 1:200 (Invitrogen, 44624G). The secondary antibodies used were goat anti—rabbit
Cy—3 Abs at 1:1000 (Jackson ImmunoResearch 711—165—152).

The sections were reacted with primary Abs overnight at 4°C after preventing non—speciﬁc binding
with 2% BSA/TBS and then incubated with secondary Abs and DAPI 30min at room temperature. The
ﬂuorescent images were collected by a laser—scanning confocal microscope (Olympus, Center Valley, PA;
FV1000).

The standardized digital photomicrographs of pharyngeal bones and teeth in serial sections were col—
lected, and the area of ﬂuorescence (pixel numbers) and ﬂuorescence intensity (mean value) of anti—GFP,
anti—DsRed, and anti—pFAK Abs—reactive regions were respectively determined by using a computer soft—
ware (Photoshop CS4 or Image]). We eliminated DsRed—positive signals in tooth buds from total DsRed
signals, so that we used DsRed signals in only pharyngeal bones in the 56—day reared group.

For Visualization of collagen matrix, the paraﬂin sections were stained with the reagents of an Azan
staining Kit (Muto Pure Chemicals Co., ltd.) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. The blue area
in a randomly selected tooth germ was determined by using computer software (Photoshop CS4).
WhoIe-transcriptome analysis. cDNA sequencing was performed for whole—transcriptome analysis
(Takara bio). A cDNA library was constructed by using a TruSeq RNA Sample Preparation Kit V2 (illumi—
nakk.co.jp). Double—stranded cDNAs were synthesized by using fragments of PolyA+RNA as templates.
The sequence data was analyzed with an HiSeq system (illuminakk.co.jp) using a sequence library.
Semi-quantitative RT-PCR analysis. Total RNA was extracted from jaws preserved with RNAlater
according to the manufacturer’s instructions, and cDNAs were synthesized by using a PrimeScript RT
reagent Kit with gDNA Erase (TaKaRa). RT—PCR analysis was performed by using EX Taq (TAMM)
according to the manufacturer’s instructions. The sequences of the primers were as follow: fkbpSf,
TGTCCAGGGTTTGATGTGGA; fkbpSr, GTTCTTTGCGTTCCCGACTG; ddit4f, GTCCAACAATGG
CAGCAGAA; ddit4r, TTCCTCCAGTGGGTCAAAGAA; gapdhf, CTTGGATACACAGAGGACCAGG;
and gapdhr, GCCAAACTCATTATCGTACCAT.
