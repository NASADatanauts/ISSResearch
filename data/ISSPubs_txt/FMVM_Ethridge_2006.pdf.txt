During the Space Shuttle “down period” a call was put out for low upmass payloads.
One of these “low up mass” International Space Station science experiments is the “Fluid
Merging Viscosity Measurement”, FMVM investigation. The purpose of FMVM is to
measure the rate of coalescence of two highly Viscous liquid drops and correlate the results
with the liquid Viscosity and surface tension. The experiment takes advantage of the low
gravitational free ﬂoating conditions in space to permit the unconstrained coalescence of two
nearly spherical drops. The merging of the drops is accomplished by deploying them from a
syringe and suspending them on 2 Nomex threads followed by the astronaut’s manipulation
of one of the drops toward a stationary droplet till contact is achieved. Coalescence and
merging occurs due to shape relaxation and reduction of surface energy, being resisted by
the Viscous drag within the liquid. The coalescence was recorded on Video (ISS VTR) and
some of the data was downlinked near real—time. A range of drop diameters, different
liquids with differing Viscosity and surface tensions should yield a large range of
experimental parameters used to correlate with theory and to compare with numerical
experiments. The results are important for a better understanding of the coalescence
process. The experiment is also relevant to liquid phase sintering and is a potential new
method for measuring the Viscosity of Viscous glass formers at low shear rates.
I. Introduction
Dring the Space Shuttle “stand-down” period the Payloads Control Board put out a call to current microgravity
science principal investigators for potential low upmass payloads for launch on 13P. In June 2003, the
Microgravity Science & Applications Division at MSFC put forward FMVM as a candidate for this ﬂight. These
were “fast track” experiments since the payload was to be launched in about six months. The “fast track” schedule
for operations required a streamlined approach to expedite payload development process. The direction was to
utilize limited upmass (< 1 kg) and volume and to make maximum use of on-orbit resources. Upon its selection, the
FMVM Development Team was quickly assembled to accomplish the design of the experiment, payload hardware,
development of requirements, operations products, and assess the safety requirements.

"2","In response to the call for low upmass experiments, on of the authors (EE) the PI of the NRA “Mechanisms for
the Crystallization of ZBLAN” proposed the “Fluid Merging Viscosity Measurement” (FMVM) experiment.
FMVM was a natural follow on experiment for examining the measurement of Viscosity of highly Viscous liquids
using two drop coalescence. The main purpose of the experiment is to advance a totally new and different method
for Viscosity measurement. Currently the measurement of Viscosity is limited for liquids that are susceptible to
crystallization. A method for determining the Viscosity of highly Viscous substances that are susceptible to
crystallization over the most important Viscosity range for crystallization behavior does not exist. A glass that is
frequently used for glass crystallization studies is lithium di-silicate. The Viscosity can be measured in the liquid
and for a certain extent of undercooling below the melting temperature. It can also be measured around the glass
transition temperature. Figure 1 shows measured Viscosity data illustrating the Wide gap of 6 orders of magnitude
that cannot be measured by any method. This unmeasured region is also the most interesting temperature range for
glass crystallization measurements.

"3","This illustrates the importance of a new Viscosity measurement method to the science of glass formation and
crystallization.

A method for measuring the Viscosity of highly Viscous substances that are susceptible to crystallization over the
most important Viscosity range is needed. A method suitable to containerless processing to avoid container walls to
heterogeneous nucleation is indicated. The process should use relatively small samples for quickly getting the
material to temperature and to quickly measure the Viscosity. The relaxation of material to a sphere is one potential
method for determining the Viscosity of very Viscous liquids. The merging of two spheres of liquids to one sphere
was selected as an executable experiment that can be used to verify shape relaxation models. The ﬂuid ﬂow is
driven by the reduction of surface energy but limited by the resistance to ﬂuid ﬂow by the liquid Viscosity. The time
constant of the experiment is proportional to the Viscosity. The method is also interesting because it can be tested by
computational ﬂuid mechanics. Frenkel2 was the ﬁrst to propose a model for the coalescence of two spheres.
Others have numerically modeled the coalescence of two liquid spheres.3’4

FMVM was further supported by prior coalescence experiments on the low gravity KC-135 parabolic aircraft
and computational ﬂuid dynamical numerical experiments. Low gravity exploratory experiments were performed
with glycerin on KC-135 aircraft for short (10 sec) experiment times and the computational ﬂuid dynamics program
FIDAP was used for numerical modeling. It was shown that the rate of coalescence can be characterized by the rate
of neck diameter growth. Two models were calculated. The 2 dimensional cylinder model was compared with a 3-
D sphere model which illustrated slightly different neck diameter growth rates. Coalescing spheres grow slower
than cylinders. The KC-135 experiments showed that the data ﬁt the 3-D spherical coalescence model up to a
normalized neck diameter of 0.5. The experiment constrained the drops keeping them from forming a sphere, the
ﬁnal shape being a cylindrical liquid bridge. Above the 0.5 normalized neck diameter, the data ﬁt the 2-D
cylindrical model. The objective of FMVM is to examine 2 drop coalescence of Viscous drops beyond the
limitations of the KC-135 experiments. The 188 provided the opportunity for much longer experiments, much larger
samples, more Viscous liquids, and unconstrained ﬂuid motion in the weightless conditions of space. The goals of
the experiment were to:

° Expand the experimental parameter space (larger drops, higher Viscosity range, longer times, unconstrained
liquid motion) to validate the Viscosity measurement method.

° Validate analysis of shape relaxation as a method of determining Viscosities of highly Viscous ﬂuids in a
microgravity environment.

° Reﬁne and calibrate mathematical models of calculation of ﬂuid Viscosities using the two drop coalescence
technique.

° Test the 60 year old theory of Frenkel for liquid sintering.

11. Rapid Payload Deployment ISS Experiment

The FMVM experiment also provided the opportunity to demonstrate that International Space Station, 188,
experiments could be developed quickly. Another objective of the FMVM payload development was to develop the
process for rapid payload deployment. The Payload Development Team was quickly assembled shortly after the
FMVM experiment was selected to be ﬂown. Table 1 lists the team members and shows how even a small, low-cost
experiment involves dozens of people.

A number of ground rules were established to accomplish the task within the 6 month window of opportunity prior
to the 13P Russian Progress resupply launch. The Payload Operations Ground rules included the development of
the Crew Procedures. Training was accomplished Via On-Board Training (OBT) on a CD. The timeline was
approved through an Engineering Change Request, ECR, 0f the ISS Increment 8 Planning data Set. The Safety
Process Ground rules included the Flight Safety Data Package, no formal MSFC Payload Safety Readiness Review
Board was deemed necessary, and a Russian Transportation Safety Data Package was developed. The MSAD
Process Ground rules stated that a number of standard documents were not applicable. Documentation was not
controlled through Control Board Process, Formal Risk Management was not to be conducted. Issues were to be
handled only as necessary. A Flight Certiﬁcation Review (FCR) was conducted within MSFC MSAD, and the
payload submitted to the COFR process. The 188 Ground Rules included the Payload Integration Agreement (PIA)
and COFR Inputs were developed.

"7","IV. FMVM Experiment Design

The experimental design parameters are quite simple. The experiment design required the measurement of the
initial diameters of the 2 drops and record the measurement of the time dependent change in the neck diameter with
the on-board digital camcorder. Several low toxicity Viscous ﬂuids spanning a 2 order of magnitude Viscosity range
with well characterized Viscosity were utilized. The manifested ﬂuids were contained in syringes also used to
deploy the liquids for the experiment. On-orbit resources utilized to bring droplets together under controlled
conditions were identiﬁed in the crew procedures controlled through crew training. Initially two 0.5 m1 droplets
were deployed onto strings and coalesced to a single 1 m1 drop. Next a 1 m1 drop was deployed and coalesced with
the ﬁrst 1 m1 drop to form a single 2 m1 drop. Next a 2 m1 drop is deployed, the process repeated and followed by a
4 m1 drop. The ﬁnal 8 m1 drop was coalesced with a 0.5 m1 drop. The temperatures of the drops were measured
with on-board Scopemeter and temperature probe. The rate of shape change was recorded with a color Video camera.
Data was captured on lab camcorder and some transmitted real time to ground. Hi-8mm Video tape was returned
from 188 and is to be used for detailed post ﬂight analysis.

The liquids selected for FMVM had to meet certain criteria. The liquids had to span a large range of Viscosities and
be nontoxic and nonirritant. Food items (liquids) were preferred since they are not characterized as chemicals. It
was desired to have different liquids, with different surface tensions in the same Viscosity range. It was highly
desirable for the liquids to have well characterized Viscosity and it was very desirable to have a non-Newtonian
liquid.

The initial selection of liquids included:

° Two syringes of Glycerin to compare with KC-135 data.

° Two syringes of Silicone oil viscosity standard liquids, 2 different Viscosities.

° Two syringes of Honey, one syringe with Sue Bee Honey off the shelf and one syringe of Sue Bee Honey
cooked to remove water content to increase the Viscosity.

° Two syringes of Corn Syrup, one syringe with Kayro off the shelf and one syringe of Kayro cooked to
remove water content to increase the Viscosity.

° Two syringes of Mineral Oil with dissolved butylene, a highly non-Newtonian liquid (Viscosity is a
function of shear rate). These liquids were not delivered for ﬂight. There was a reaction with the syringe
plunger causing it to swell.

The liquids were vacuum out gassed for 24 hours to remove dissolved gasses. They were then loaded into 10 cc
medical syringes that had been previously certiﬁed for ﬂight. The materials manifested on 13P included 8 syringes,
10 ml each of the ﬁrst 4 sets of ﬂuids above. One background grid card for droplet image calibration was produced
from the same material and by the process for astronaut crew cue cards. It was also included in the manifest. The
manifest liquids were shipped to Russia for 13P. The Russian—built cargo freighter, Progress 13F, mounted atop an
unmanned Soyuz rocket was launched from Baikonur Cosmodrome in Kazakhstan on January 29, 2004 to the
International Space Station.

After delivery of the manifest materials, we undertook the characterization of the liquids. A Brookﬁeld rotating
spindle viscometer was used to measure the Viscosity of all the liquids. The shear dependence was also determined
for liquids. Silicone oil viscosity standards, glycerin, and corn syrup are Newtonian liquids, Viscosity is not a
function of shear rate for the rates measured. Mineral Oil with butylenes and honey are non-Newtonian, see Figure
6. The change in Viscosity is directly related to the rate of shear. An order of magnitude increase of shear rate
decreases the Viscosity by one order.

Surface Tension 0f the ﬂight liquids was determined both by the pendant drop method and the drop-weight
methods. The pendant drop method uses stationary equilibrium drop shape to determine surface tension. For the
drop—weight method, liquid contained in a syringe was slowly dripped through a known diameter oriﬁce tube. The
weight of the liquid drop that causes the drop to break the liquid bridge holding the drop to the oriﬁce is directly
related to the surface tension. A number of drops (20) were dropped to obtain an average drop weight.

The measured properties of the liquids used for 188 experiments is tabulated in Table 111.

"9","IV. Ground Based Validation of the FMVM Experiment Methods

In order to validate the ﬂight experiment methods, desktop experiments were performed with the ﬂight liquids.
Two Nomex threads were used to hold 2 small (1 mm) drops. A Sony Digital—8 Handycam digital camcorder with
25X optical zoom was used to record the coalescence of the small drops. UleadVideo Studio 7 and PIXELA
software was used to capture Video AVI ﬁles and individual JPG images to be analyzed. Spotlight 16 image
analysis software was used for digital measurements of the captured frames.

Recently a root time scaling law has been applied to the coalescence of two liquid drops. Based on physical
arguments, Eggers8 proposed that the droplet neck growth followed a square root time scaling law. This square root

coalescence time dependence was conﬁrmed experimentally in the inertial regime of anISCId liquid drops .
Ground based experiments were conducted with honey liquid spheres suspended on Nomex thread. Figure 7 shows

The experiment operations were observed real time during acquisition of signal, AOS. During loss of signal,
LOS, from 188, astronaut Mike Fincke proceeded along with the experiment operations with Video data being
recorded on board. Glycerin could not be deployed onto the Nomex thread. Operations with the 2 different silicone
oil liquids were completed. The samples of honey had crystallized and were stowed for later operations. The
operations with the 2 different corn syrup liquids were also completed, but rapid rigid ﬁlm formation caused a
number of drop coalescences to be compromised by the rigid ﬁlm.

Procedures were developed to utilize the Space Station Food Warmer to heat the syringes with crystallized
honey. Heating for an hour completely dissolved the crystals. In May 2005, experiment operations were scheduled
for the two honey liquids. Astronaut J ohn Philips performed the experiments during Space Station increment 11.
Unfortunately, there was extended loss of signal (LOS) during the operations. We are anxious to obtain the Video
tapes to see the results.

On his own initiative, astronaut Mike Fincke captured several of the drop coalescences as AVI ﬁles and sent
them down as digital ﬁles to the investigators. These high resolution Video clips have been very useful for
preliminary data analysis. Figure 11 shows a representative still frame from the AVI Video data.

Prior to obtaining the high resolution Video data tapes that were returned to earth by the return to ﬂight Space
Shuttle mission, some preliminary examination of the data has been performed. Figure 12 shows the normalized
neck diameter vs. square root time for the 4 cc drop coalescence run shown in Figure 11. This plot shows the linear
root time dependence of coalescence with highly Viscous, very large diameter liquid drops.

When the high resolution digital data tapes are obtained, all the ISS experiments will be examined according to

the coalescence models. This will provide a new insight into the liquid coalescence and sintering of spheres
roblem. The data will also be used to evaluate the method for Viscosit determination. Frenkel2 introduced the
P y
concept of a characteristic coalescence time constant. The time constant is proportional to the liquid Viscosity times
the initial sphere diameter divided by the surface tension.
t = (n D ) / 6

Initial evaluation of this simple concept indicates that by calculating the time constant for different Viscosity
liquids and experimental data with standard liquids, it will be possible to determine the Viscosity from an unknown
liquid’s measured time constant. Initially we are considering the time for the joining liquid neck of two coalescing
spheres to reach 0.5 of the initial droplet diameter as the experimental time constant.
