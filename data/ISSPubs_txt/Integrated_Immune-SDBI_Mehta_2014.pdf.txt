Received in rEViSEd form 20 May 2014 Space Shuttle missions. Blood, urine, and saliva samples were collected during each of these phases.
23:11: 261:1 gilmgyxigf Antiviral antibodies and viral load (DNA) were measured for Epstein—Barr virus (EBV), varicella—zoster
virus (VZV), and cytomegalovirus (CMV). Three astronauts did not shed any virus in any of their samples

Cortisol controls were also included in the study. Approximately 2—5% of controls shed EBV while none shed VZV
DHEA or CMV. Salivary cortisol measured preﬂight and during ﬂight were elevated relative to post—ﬂight. In
contrast DHEA decreased during the ﬂight phase relative to both preﬂight and post—ﬂight. As a
consequence, the molar ratio of the area under the diurnal curve of cortisol to DHEA with respect to
ground (AUCg) increased signiﬁcantly during ﬂight. This ratio was unrelated to viral shedding. In
summary, three herpes viruses can reactivate individually or in combination during spaceﬂight.
