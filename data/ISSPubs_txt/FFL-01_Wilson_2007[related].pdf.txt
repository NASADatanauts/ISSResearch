The engineering of bacterial strains with speciﬁc phenotypes frequently requires the use of blocks or
“cassettes” of genes that act together to perform a desired function. The potential beneﬁts of utilizing type III
secretion systems in this regard are becoming increasingly realized since these systems can be used to direct U
interactions with host cells for beneﬁcial purposes such as vaccine development, anticancer therapies, and g
targeted protein delivery. However, convenient methods to clone and transfer type III secretion systems for :5
studies of a range of different types of bacteria are lacking. In addition to functional applications, such methods 5
would also reveal important information about the evolution of a given type III secretion system, such as its 8
ability to be expressed and functional outside of the strain of origin. We describe here the cloning of the 8
Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium pathogenicity island 2 (SPI-2) type III secretion system onto a vector _.,
that can be easily transferred to a range of gram-negative bacterial genera. We found that expression of the a
cloned SPI-2 system in different Gammaproteobacteria and Alphaproteobacteria (as monitored by SseB protein 3
levels) is dependent on the bacterial strain and growth medium. We also demonstrate that the cloned system 3
is functional for secretion, can direct interactions with macrophages, and can be used as a novel tool to analyze 6""
the predicted interaction of SseB with host cells. This work provides a foundation for future applications where Q
the cloned SPI-2 region (or other cloned type III systems) can provide a desired function to an engineered g
gram-negative strain. 3
