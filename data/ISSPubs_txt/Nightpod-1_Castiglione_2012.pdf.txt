THE NIGHTPOD — AN ORBITAL MOTION COMPENSATION MECHANISM FOR 188 BASED
IMAGING
Luigi Castiglione 1’ §, Simon Silvio C0nticello*, Marco Esposit0*, Rody Oldenhuis*, Scott G. M00n*, Anja
Nicolait, Stephan Stoltzt, J an DettInann:t

In support of ISS Andre Kuipers' long term PromISSe mission, ESA uploaded a system supporting the
Astronaut in taking pictures of the Earth at Night from inside the ISS Cupola. In particular, the NightPod has
been used for Observation of human settlements (e.g. Cities, roads, sea establishments), wild ﬁres, volcano
activities, and is expected to provide an unprecedented resolution of < 15 m/pixel.

The NightPod is a state-of—the-art electro-Inechanical system which accommodates commercial Optical
cameras and compensates for the orbital motion and attitude of the 188. The compensation is achieved by a non-
linear motorized rotation of the camera with arcsecond accuracy. The NightPod computer directly controls the
camera and synchronizes the n0n-linear rotation of the pointing aXis and the integration time Of the camera. The
NightPod allows rotation in 4 axes. Two axes are used to align the NightPod t0 the 188 local nadir direction. The
third motorized aXis rotates during Operation keeping the desired target steady in the camera's ﬁeld of View for
the several seconds integration period. The fourth aXis is used to manually point at Off-track targets.

The NightPod is stowed disassembled and can be easily mounted in Cupola before Operation. When
assembled, the NightPod interfaces to the Cupola Via custom-Inade, easy to use locking mechanisms.

In this paper the system engineering approach to fulﬁl the strict technical, safety and programmatic
requirements for the development of the NightPod is presented. The NightPod is the ﬁrst payload installed by
BSA in the Cupola. The lessons learned from this project will be beneﬁcial to the development of future
payloads for Earth Observation from 188. The Challenging ﬂight hardware design and development process,
together with a full ProtO-Flight testing campaign, was successfully concluded in only ﬁve months in order to be
on time for the launch of the Soyuz 298 to the 188, on the 21th of December 2011. Commissioning has been
successfully completed on the 24th of February 2012. The NightPod is part Of the Crew standard training and
will be Operated by all Crew Members ﬂying to the 188 in the coming years. The NightPod is the result of an
efﬁcient collaboration between cosine (NL) as prime contractor, Astro-und Feinwerktechnik (DE) as
subcontractor, and the directorate Of Human Space Flight and Operations (ESA)- HSO. The proj ect is funded by
ESA under the GSTP programme, with the support of the Dutch and German delegates.
