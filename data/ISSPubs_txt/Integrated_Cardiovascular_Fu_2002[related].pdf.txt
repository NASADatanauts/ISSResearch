Astronauts returning to Earth have reduced orthostatic tolerance and exercise capacity. Alterations
in autonomic nervous system and neuromuscular function after spaceﬂight might contribute to
this problem. In this study, we tested the hypothesis that exposure to microgravity impairs
autonomic neural control of sympathetic outﬂow in response to peripheral afferent stimulation
produced by handgrip and a cold pressor test in humans. We studied ﬁve astronauts ~72 and
23 days before, and on landing day after the 16 day Neurolab (STS-90) space shuttle mission, and
four of the astronauts during ﬂight (day 12 or 13). Heart rate, arterial pressure and peroneal muscle
sympathetic nerve activity (MSNA) were recorded before and during static handgrip sustained to
fatigue at 40 % of maximum voluntary contraction, followed by 2 min of circulatory arrest pre-, in-
and post-ﬂight. The cold pressor test was applied only before (ﬁve astronauts) and during ﬂight
(day 12 or 13, four astronauts). Mean (i S.E.M.) baseline heart rates and arterial pressures were
similar among pre-, in- and post-ﬂight measurements. At the same relative fatiguing force, the peak
systolic pressure and mean arterial pressure during static handgrip were not different before, during
and after spaceﬂight. The peak diastolic pressure tended to be higher post- than pre-ﬂight (112 i 6
vs. 99 i 5 mmHg, P = 0.088). Contraction-induced rises in heart rate were similar pre-, in- and
post-ﬂight. MSNA was higher post-ﬂight in all subjects before static handgrip (26 i 4 post- vs.
15 i 4 bursts min‘1 pre-ﬂight, P = 0.017). Contraction-evoked peak MSNA responses were not
different before, during, and after spaceﬂight (41 i 4, 38 i 5 and 46 i 6 bursts min_l, all P > 0.05).
MSNA during post-handgrip circulatory arrest was higher post- than pre- or in-ﬂight (41 i 1 vs.
33 i 3 and 30 i 5 bursts min_l, P = 0.038 and 0.036). Similarly, responses of MSNA and blood
pressure to the cold pressor test were well maintained in-ﬂight. We conclude that modulation of
muscle sympathetic neural outﬂow by muscle metaboreceptors and skin nociceptors is preserved
during short duration spaceﬂight.

Individual and mean (i S.E.M.) responses to static handgrip sustained to fatigue at 40 % of maximal
voluntary contraction, followed by 2 min post-handgrip circulatory arrest pre-ﬂight (n = 5), in-ﬂight
(n = 4) and post-ﬂight (n = 5). Data were averaged for 1 min ofbaseline, 1 min of the initial static handgrip,
the last 30 s of handgrip prior to fatigue (presented as ‘at fatigue’) and for each 1 min of post-handgrip
circulatory arrest and recovery. The period between the end of the ﬁrst minute and 30 s before fatigue was
broken up into two equal periods and are depicted as ‘a’ and ‘b’ in the ﬁgure. BL, baseline; HGl, ﬁrst minute
