The Gorkha earthquake (M 7.8) on 25 April 2015 and later aftershocks struck South Asia, killing ~9,000
and damaging a large region. Supported by a large campaign of responsive satellite data acquisitions
over the earthquake disaster zone, our team undertook a satellite image survey of the earthquakes’
induced geohazards in Nepal and China and an assessment of the geomorphic, tectonic, and lithologic
controls on quake-induced landslides. Timely analysis and communication aided response and recovery
and informed decision makers. We mapped 4,312 co-seismic and post-seismic landslides. We also
surveyed 491 glacier lakes for earthquake damage, but found only 9 landslide-impacted lakes and no
visible satellite evidence of outbursts. Landslide densities correlate with slope, peak ground acceleration,
surface downdrop, and specific metamorphic lithologies and large plutonic intrusions.

Fig. 1. Location of 4312 earthquake-related geohazards. (A) Distribution of glaciers (blue),
Iate-season snowfields (red), landslides (white dots), and main shock and largest aftershock
epicenters. The base topography is from the SRTM 90 m gap-filled DEM (33). Glacier extents are
from the Randolph Glacier Inventory (RGI) (61). Snowfields were derived from pre-event
Landsat-8 VNIR-SWIR band ratios and topographic masks. (B) Landslides plotted with local peak
ground accelerations induced by the main Gorkha shock or >6M aftershocks. PGAs from U.S.
Geological Survey’s USGS-NEIC ShakeMap (62). Inset panels b1 and b2 are enlarged to show
details near Langtang and Pisang. (C) Landslides plotted with reported deaths per Nepal district
are from the Government of Nepal, Nepal Disaster Risk Reduction Project. (D) Hazard
occurrences (black dots) on calculated slopes. Inset shows detail of hazard-dense region. (E)
Smoothed area density (log scale) of earthquake-induced landslides determined using a
neighborhood1/8° >< 1/8° search window (~14 km x 12 km) in relation to major (2M6) epicenters
of historic earthquakes and the Gorkha quakes (62). Densities range between 0.01 and 3.37
landslides/ka. Higher landslide densities occur locally on scales finer than 1/8°.
