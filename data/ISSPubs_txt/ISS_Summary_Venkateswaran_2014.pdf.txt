(Received February 18, 2014—Accepted June 17, 2014—Published online August 12, 2014)

The National Research Council (NRC) has recently recognized the International Space Station (188) as uniquely suitable for
furthering the study of microbial species in closed habitats. Answering the NRC’s call for the study, in particular, of uncommon
microbial species in the 188, and/or of those that have signiﬁcantly increased or decreased in number, space microbiologists
have begun capitalizing on the maturity, speed, and cost-effectiveness of molecular/genornic microbiological technologies to
elucidate changes in microbial populations in the ISS and other closed habitats. Since investigators can only collect samples
infrequently from the ISS itself due to logistical reasons, Earth analogs, such as spacecraft-assernbly clean rooms, are used and
extensively characterized for the presence of microbes. Microbiologists identify the predominant, problematic, and extreme-
philic microbial species in these closed habitats and use the 188 as a testbed to study their resistance to extreme extraterrestrial
environmental conditions. Investigators monitor the microbes exposed to the real space conditions in order to track their
genomic changes in response to the selective pressures present in outer space (external to the ISS) and the spaceﬂight (in the
interior of the 188). In this reVieW, we discussed the presence of microbes in space research-related closed habitats and the
resistance of some microbial species to the extreme environmental conditions of space.
