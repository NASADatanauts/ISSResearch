Abstract—The inﬂuence of spatial orientation of the International Space Station (ISS) 0n the dose rate
recorded during passages of the station through the South—Atlantic anomaly (SAA) zone is considered. The
dose rates detected by dosimeters 0f the radiation control system of the ISS are compared with results of cal—
culation—based estimates. It is shown that when crossing the SAA region in close trajectories, but with differ—
ent spatial orientation of the station, the dose rate near cabins 0f the ISS Service Module can differ by more

than a factor of two.
