Abstract
The design of the thermal control and management system (TCS) is a central
task in satellite design. In order to evaluate and dimensionize the properties of
the TCS, material parameters specifying the conductive and radiative properties
of the different TCS components have to be known including their respective
variations Within the mission lifetime. In particular the Change of the thermo—
optical properties of the outer surfaces including critical TCS components such
as radiators and thermal insulation are subject to degradation caused by inter—
action With the space environment. The evaluation of these material parameters
by means of ground tests is a time—consuming and expensive endeavour. Long—
term in—situ measurements on board the 188 or large satellites realize a better
implementation of the inﬂuence of the space environment but also imply high
costs. Motivated by this we propose the utilization of low—Cost nano satellite
systems to realize material tests Within space at a considerably reduced cost.
We present a nanosat—scale degradation sensor concept Which realizes low power

1. INTRODUCTION
The development and the qualiﬁcation of the thermal control and manage—
ment system (TCS) is one of the most critical steps in satellite design. The
TCS has to meet thermal requirements throughout a satellite mission and t0
5 operate safely Within the speciﬁed performance throughout the designed mis—
sion lifetime. Typically thermal coatings, multi layer insulations, heaters and
radiators are used for the design of the TCS. Among these, these components
exposed to the space environment are subject to a degradation of their thermo—
optical surface properties [1, 2]. The magnitude of surface degradation effects
10 varies greatly With different materials and depends on the mission proﬁle, the
mission duration, the orientation of the respective surfaces and the solar activ—
ity. The dominant environmental causes for degradation are photon radiation,
interaction With Charged particles, micrometeroid and debris impacts, low earth
atomic oxygen[3] and cyclic variations of surface temperatures caused by ab—
15 sorbed solar radiation. In this respect, satellites operating in low earth orbits
are most vulnerable to optical degradation effects [4]. Efforts can be taken to
mitigate degradation effects for commonly used spacecraft materials such as
Kapton 0r MLI, Which show severe degradation for long—time space exposure
[5, 6, 7]. However, different materials are affected in different ways by exposure
20 t0 the space environment and the magnitude of the effect depends on mission
and spacecraft speciﬁc parameters. Consequently, any material used in the TCS
has to be tested before it can be used Within the spacecraft design process.
With respect to the performance of the TCS, the coefﬁcients of absorptivity
2

"4","oz and emissivity 5 are the critical parameters subjected to surface degradation
25 effects. In the following we only consider mean values and do not include any
wavelength—dependancies in the approach. Since both parameters determine
the efﬁciency of radiating surfaces used as a heat sink, any change in oz 01‘ 5
effectively Changes the equilibrium temperatures and the resulting heat ﬂuxes
in or out of the satellite system. With regard to the equilibrium temperature
30 the heat balance for an external ﬂat plate With surface A illuminated by the sun
With solar intensity PG at illumination angle ng and heated by internal heat
sources With QSAT shows

Pm = Pout (1)
cos(q5®)AozP® + QSAT : 514an, (2)
Where 0 is the Stefan—Boltzmann number. If e.g. for the case of a radiator
the internal heat ﬂow QSAT is used as an indicator for its efﬁciency it is obvious,
35 that any Change of oz 01‘ 5 reduces or increases the radiator performance. Since
internal payloads have to be kept Within a speciﬁed temperature range by the
TCS, such Changes in optical properties have to be mitigated to guarantee that

the TCS operates Within speciﬁcations for the mission lifetime.
As a consequence, data on the degradation properties of each material used
40 for external components of the TCS is needed for the design of satellite missions
and the development of the involved thermal control concepts. Typically the
best results are achieved, When ground laboratory tests, in—situ tests in the
space environment and numerical modelling are performed in unison. Ground
experiments enable access to the experiment at any time. However, they are
45 limited in the feasible level of space environmental modelling and also imply high
costs for personal and equipment, in particular for long—duration degradation
experiments [8]. Numerical m0de1s[9] can back experimental results and enable
a much faster parameter analysis than experimental testing but always need
tests as a conﬁrmation of simulated results[10]. Long—term in—situ exposure
50 onboard the 188 such as the Materials International Space Station Experiment
(MISSE), [11, 12] or by means of a full scale dedicated missions such as the

3

"
"5","Long Duration Exposure Facility (LDEF) [13]) enables an improved quality of
test data, since the tests are performed directly Within the space environment
but also implies a considerable cost and planning effort.

55 In order to obtain the advantages of in—situ testing but at the same time re—
duce the costs drastically, dedicated cubesat missions With degradation sensors
seem to be a feasible option. A typical 1U1 cubesat [14] mission can be real—
ized Within a much lower timeframe and at much lower costs than experiments
aboard the 188 or a full scale satellite. The technology is Commercial—Of—The—

60 Shelf (COTS), available and starting options at reduced costs are becoming
increasingly available. Hence, a degradation sensor concept has been developed
at ZARM, Which allows the conduction of degradation experiments on a 1U
cubesat for 16 different material specimen. The measured degradation data is
directly available Via downlink and experiment evaluation does not require the

65 return of specimen to earth. The design of the sensor, ﬁrst results from qual—
iﬁcation tests, details on the methods used and an outlook on the dedicated
cubesat mission Which Will enable a space qualiﬁcation of the hardware Will be
given in the following sections.

2. CIDD BASIC CONCEPT

70 The degradation sensor concept introduced here uses the dynamic evolution
of a heated plate Which cools off While emitting heat radiation into space. A
typical temperature proﬁle used for emissivity evaluation is shown in ﬁg. 1.
After a heating time (1.), in general any starting temperature (2.) can be
realized by an equilibrium of ingoing and outgoing heat ﬂuxes Pm and Pout.

75 If the sensor is shaded from direct solar inﬂuence and the thermal interface
between sensor and mounting can be considered as perfectly isolated, eq. 1 can
be employed to calculate an equilibrium temperature T 6 With

L = (f—A) , <3)

"
"6","Where QH is the power of the applied heating, A is the area of the surface facing
space and 5 is the coefﬁcient of emissivity 0f the outward surface. If the heater
80 is turned off, the plate Will 0001 down (3.), depending on the total heat energy
stored Within its heat capacity. The emerging evolution of surface temperature
T can then be employed as a direct measure for the surface emissivity following
the heat ﬂow equation
pcaa—Cf: — AAT : —qe,v : —%5A0Tf, (4)
Where AT 2 % + % + g is the temperature gradient, 0 is the speciﬁc heat
85 capacity of the emitting body, V is the body volume, d is the body thickness
and p is the density of the respective material, A is the heat conductivity and
q'ey is the volume—speciﬁc emitted heat ﬂux.
A comparable approach can be taken for the determination of the plate
absorptivity oz. Here, the plate is pointed towards the sun and the heating of
90 the plate is purely conducted by absorption of solar radiation. In this case the
equilibrium temperature can be expressed as
l
Te : (aPQ cosq5)4 . (5)
05A
If the surface emissivity is known (e.g. from a previous emissivity measure—
ments), the equlibrium temperature is a measure for the surface absorptivity.
In addition the temperature evolution during heating can be employed to de—
95 termine oz. Details on 5/05 determination are shown in the following section.
3. CIDD Layout
The basic CIDD Layout for a single sensor element is shown in ﬁg. 2. The
sensor consists of three different layers, Which are pinched by clip mountings
of low thermal conductivity. The ﬁrst layer is the material specimen for Which
100 the optical parameters have to be determined. In order to realize a good sensor
performance, the thermal gradient through the specimen layer has to be small.
As a consequence, a material With low thermal conductivity has to be worked

also be integrated as thin plates.

105 In the sensor center, a thermal bonding and temperature measurement unit
is mounted. This layer is worked out as a good thermal conductor (A > 2
W / (K m)). Besides allowing a good heat transfer to the material specimen this
layer has a thermal reservoir function, too. The third layer is the heater element,
Where a copper spool is etched on a thin foil allowing for quick heating With only

110 minor heat storage Within the heater layer. In order to reduce radiative heat
transfer to the bottom, a radiation shield (high reﬂectivity at NIR) is mounted
on the opposite side of the heater. A breadboard model of the single sensor
Channel concept has been realized and used for ﬁrst performance and qualiﬁ—
cation tests. Figure 3 shows the assembled prototype. The heater element is

115 realized as a thin Kapton foil With a copper spool as thermal resistor With an
external voltage. The temperature measurement is conducted by a PthO ther—
moelement With an external ampliﬁer that can be used for calibration and noise
reduction. The three sensor layers are ﬁtted into a IOW—Conductive frame struc—

130 4. DETERMINING OPTICAL PROPERTIES

In order to analyze the temperature evolution of a heated sensor layer, the
heat ﬂow equation (see eq. 4) has to be solved. Here the conductivity A is
considered to be constant and isotropic, While gay is the heat ﬂow from internal
heat sources 01"" to external heat sinks. Assuming a perfect insulation of the

135 sensor rear and sides and the volume—speciﬁe radiation heat ﬂux of the specimen
surface as the only heat sink qmdy and no additional heating during the cooling

"10","process, the 1D—heat ﬂow equation applies:
8T 82T
— — A— : — ° . 6
p0 825 8:32 gradJ/ ( )
Since all parts of the sensor can be considered as thermally thin and show a
good thermal conductivity, it can be assumed that the sensor can be treated
140 as a block capacity and that temperature differences Within the layer can be
neglected:
T(F,t) m T(t). (7)
As a consequence, eq. 6 evolves t0
dT
pcVE : —50A(T4 — T310), (8)
Where the radiative heat ﬂow leaving the volume is given by the Stefan—Boltzmann
law for grey body radiation. The temperature evolution can now be acquired
145 by means of separation of variables and yields:
m 5 'A-a
Tt = 3 #HT-M—é), 9
< > < E W 0 > < >
Which also accounts for a variation of surface emissivity 5( j ) on discrete parts
A(j) of a surface A. Note that for this solution the external temperature has
been assumed to be zero.
A more general description is possible by following the Buckingham 7T theorem
150 [15]. The material parameters can thus be combined in dimensionless num—
bers, Which enables material mitigations and scaled models (similitude). By
implementing the dimensionless temperature 9 = T20, the position coordinate

5. FE-MODEL
165 As a tool for optimization, evaluation of experimental results and error es—
timation a 3D ﬁnite element (FE) model of the sensor has been set up. The
model implements all functionality of the sensor prototype (heating, cooling,
measurement) and includes 3D thermal conduction Within the sensor layers as

170 The model Which is set up in ANSYS APDL can be applied to implement a sin—
gle sensor or a complete array including heat cross—Coupling between adjacent
sensors. A plot of a 16—Channel thermal FE simulation of CIDD is shown in ﬁg.
5. The heat distribution Within the sensor element and the evolution of temper—
atures at the boundary to neighboring sensors is analyzed in order to develop a

175 thermal interface and insulation meeting the requirement for a dominant radia—
tive heat transport. By means of FE parameter analysis optimal conﬁgurations
are determined as a basis for improved prototypes of the multi—sensor array.

been tested extensively in order to Characterize sensor parameters and perfor-
mance. In order to perform functional tests we applied 6 different material
specimen with constant Optical surface properties. Furthermore we applied 2

The tested material specimen are shown in ﬁg. 6. For each test the respective

reduce measurement noise affecting the Pt—lOO performance. Each test consisted
of the heating of the sensor to the starting temperature of 370 K and the aqui—
sition of temperature evolution during cooling. Each result has been compared
to simulated results gathered by means of the parametrized FE model. As can

195 be seen for a comparison of the measured and simulated temperature curve for
the anodized aluminum specimen (shown in ﬁg. 7) experimental and simulated
results match pretty well, demonstrating the suitability of the simulations for a
Characterization and optimization of the sensor.

210 implemented. Both covers show a considerable outgassing tendency in vacuum,
Which effectively leads to a variation of the effective surface emissivity, When vac—
uum is applied. The results of emissivity evaluation for a couple of subsequent

the course of vacuum exposure, corresponding to the outgassing status of the
conductive paste. Thus the general feasibility of long—term degradation eval—
220 uation With CIDD has been demonstrated by the simpliﬁed breadborol setup.
Future measurements Will include sensor covers Which can be applied to realize
deﬁned effective 5 states. This Will then also enable a quantitative analysis of
the sensor performance.
Efforts to demonstrate the evaluation of surface absorptivity oz are underway.
225 In order to realize this, a lamp With a spectrum resembling the solar spectrum
Will be integrated into the vacuum Chamber and a sensor shade Will be integrated
into the sensor breadborol, allowing for the simulation of different illumination
conditions. Furthermore future tests Will also include a full thermal mockup of
a cubesat satellite as a testbed enabling the analysis of the thermal coupling
230 between CIDD and a bus structure.
7. ROLAND-l MISSION
In order to test the sensor hardware Within the space environment, to demon—
strate the feasibility of degradation experiments With cubesat technology and
to qualify the hardware for future applications a dedicated cubesat mission is
235 planned. The Roland—I satellite (displayed in ﬁg. 9) Will deliver the necessary
infrastructure for the sensor operations and communications. The data inter—
face Will be provided by an 12C Bus, the downlink Will be realized Within the
amateur radio frequency band. Besides the degradation sensor array, Roland—l
Will be equipped With a ,uN thruster payload, micro satellite AOCS hardware for
240 qualiﬁcation experiments and a ﬁne grid of temperature sensors for calibration
procedures and evaluation of the thermal environernent inﬂuencing the sensor
measurements. Attitude control requirements are quite moderate since CIDD
only requires to point to free space during emissivity measurements. Thus the
actual orientation of the satellite is only restricted With respect to solar and
245 earth radiation. In the second measurement mode, absorptivity can be deter—

of CIDD, AOCS can be performed by magnetic torquers Which Will be part of
250 the AOCS qualiﬁcation payload. Roland—l aims at a 6—months nominal oper—
ation, thus enabling CIDD to gather degradation data for most of this period.
In nominal operations7 emissivity and absorptivity tests are planned to be per—
formed on a daily basis. Depending on the status of the funding, the launch
of the Roland-l satellite is planned in 2018. In correspondence to the mission
255 schedule the CIDD ﬂight model Will be ﬁnished in 2017.
8. CONCLUSION
We have presented a nano—satellite scale degradation sensor concept Which is
able to determine the degradation of optical surface parameters oz and 5 for 16
different material specimen. Results aquired With a single Channel breadboard
260 model have shown the feasibility of the concept Which allows for the aquisition of
in—situ experimental data at a moderate cost by using COTS cubesat technology.
Currently a 16—Channe1 breadbord model is under development Which Will be
16

"18","the basis for a ﬂight model prototype to be tested on the ROLAND—l cubesat
mission planned for 2018. The CIDD concept allows for in—situ measurements at
265 cubesat—scale costs, does not depend on a recovery of the experiment and enables
access to the degradation experiment at any time. By this CIDD contributes
to material science and the spacecraft design process by offering an option to
realize space exposure experiments With moderate costs and preparation effort.
