A very good means to compare risk assessments is to use

Charts. The bars in ﬁgures 3 and 4 start on the left at the 5th

certainty that the true value of the risk in question 1ies
somewhere on the bar. The gray vertical lines on the bars
are the modes of the distributions, and the color density on
the bar is directly proportional to the probability density.
These modiﬁed bareharts provide insights into these

better decisions for aerospace systems are possible.
