Notes. The percentages of aberrant cells, which includes all types of aberrations, are evaluated as average values
for the number of crew members speciﬁed in column 2. Data from refs. (4) and (8) were obtained using FISH with
a combination of whole-chromosome probes speciﬁc for chromosomes 1, 2, 4 0r 5, and then scaled to the whole
genome. Data from refs. (5—7) were obtained from Giemsa-stained specimens. For postﬂight data (column 5), sam-
pling time after returning to Earth was between 0 and 180 days. The ratios of the fractions of aberrant cells reported
in columns 4 and 5 are given in column 6. Physical doses reported in column 7 were measured by TLDs. In this
column, dose ranges are reported when measured doeses differed for the crew members studied.

chromosomes 5, 11 and 8, 10. A total of eight different chromosomes are therefore involved in aberrations. A detailed karyotype can be obtained by
comparing the color image with the DAPI-stained image, which displays G-band-like patterns. The karyotype of this cell is: 44, XY, dic(2;9)

the dicentrics (total number of objects is 44), nor were reciprocal fragments evident on (apparently terminal deleted) chromosomes 10 and 11. This
apparent incompleteness may have been caused by the technical resolution of the InFISH technique, with which small, light fragments are sometimes
