Abstract
Experiments executed on the upper limb are assuming increasing signiﬁcance in the frame of the Human Physiology in space, for
at least two reasons: the upper limb is the principal means of locomotion for the subject living in a space station; furthermore,
fatigue can have a signiﬁcant effect on the hand, for the ordinary work on board, and in particular for the extra—vehicular actiVities.
The degradation of the performances affecting the muscular—skeletal apparatus can be easily recognized on the upper limb, by
exerting speciﬁc scientiﬁc protocols, to be repeated through the permanence of the subject in weightlessness conditions. Another
aspect relevant to the effect of microgravity 0n the upper limb is associated With the alteration of the motor control programs due to
the different gravity factor, affecting not only the bio—Inechanics of the subject, but in general all his/her psycho—physical conditions,
induced by the totally different environment. Speciﬁc protocols on the upper limb can facilitate the studies on learning mechanisms
for the motor control. The results of such experiments can be transferred to the Earth, useful for treatment of subjects With local
traumas or diseases of the Central Nervous System.
