Abstract Following an European Space Agency announcement of opportunity in 1996 for
”Externally mounted payloads for lst utilization phase” 011 the International Space Station
(188), scientists working in the ﬁelds of astrobiology proposed experiments aiming at long-
term exposure of a variety of chemical compounds and extremely resistant microorganisms
to the hostile space environment. The ESA exposure facility EXPOSE was built and an
operations' concept was prepared. The EXPOSE experiments were developed through an
intensive pre-ﬂight experiment veriﬁcation test program. 12 years later, two sets of
astrobiological experiments in two EXPOSE facilities have been successfully launched to
the 188 for external exposure for up to 1.5 years. EXPOSE-E, now installed at the balcony
of the European Columbus module, was launched in February 2008, while EXPOSE-R
took off to the 188 in November 2008 and was installed on the external URM-D platform of
the Russian Zvezda module in March 2009.

Introduction
The space environment provides a complex spectrum of physical parameters that are not
experienced on Earth and that are of high interest to astrobiology, such as high vacuum and
different qualities of radiation. In interplanetary space, pressure reaches values down to 10'14 Pa;
however, in the Vicinity of a body — planetary body or artiﬁcial satellite — the pressure
rises significantly due to outgasing of volatiles from the body. In Low Earth Orbit (LEO),
pressure ranges from 10'6 to 10'4 Pa. In the cargo bay of the Space Shuttle, e.g., a pressure
of 3.99X10'5 Pa due to outgasing was measured With cargo bay doors open after 100 h
Mission Elapsed Time (MET)(Scialdone 1983). The maj or constituents in LEO are molecular
oxygen, hydrogen and nitrogen as well as highly reactive oxygen and nitrogen atoms.
Concerning the origin of cosmic radiation two components can be distinguished: galactic
radiation and solar radiation. Galactic cosmic radiation consists of 85% protons, electrons,
14% oc—particles and 1% heavy ions of charge Z>2 (HZE particles). The solar particle
radiation is composed of 90—95% protons, 5—10% oc—particles and a few heaVier ions. In the
radiation belts near Earth, protons and electrons (of galactic and solar origin) are trapped by
the geomagnetic ﬁeld. Solar electromagnetic radiation spans from short wavelength X-rays
to radio frequencies. At the distance of the Earth, the average solar constant is 1,360 W m'z.
Though only 7% of this solar irradiance belongs to the biologically damaging UV range, its
effect on life is signiﬁcant. Whereas on Earth, the stratospheric ozone layer cuts off photons
of wavelengths below 290 nm, in LEO the full extraterrestrial UV spectrum is available,
including UV—C (190-280 nm) and vacuum-UV (<190 nm).
Space technology has provided opportunities to expose terrestrial specimens, such as
prebiotic compounds, organic molecules and organisms, to this unique environment of space
or to selected space conditions (Horneck and Brack 1992). Questions to be tackled include:
° the chemistry of precursors of life in space, e.g. in the interstellar medium or in comets;
° the role of the extraterrestrial short wavelength UV radiation, at present absorbed by the
Earth’s ozone layer, on prebiotic and biological evolution;

0 the survival of microorganisms, When travelling in space, e.g. as blind passengers inside
of meteorites (lithopanspermia hypothesis);

° the survival of microbial contaminants on space craft on outbound missions to other
planets (planetary protection requirements);

° the limits of life.

During previous space missions, such as Gemini, Apollo 16 (Taylor et al. 1974),
Spacelab 1 (Horneck et al. 1984a and b), Spacelab D2 (Horneck et al. 1994a; 1996), LDEF
(Long Duration Exposure Facility) (Horneck et al. 1994b), MIR (Rettberg et al. 2002),
EURECA (EUropean REtrievable CArrier) (Horneck et al. 1995) and several Foton
missions (Horneck et al. 2001, Rettberg et al. 2004, Sancho et al. 2007) (Table 1), exposure
of various microorganisms to selected or combined space conditions demonstrated the
lethal effects of extraterrestrial short wavelength solar UV radiation, but also the enormous
resistance of selected species against LEO vacuum When UV shielded (Horneck 1998).
Recent experiments on board of the BIOPAN facility extended the list of organisms
surviving exposure to space vacuum in LEO With lichens (Sancho et al. 2007) and
tardigrades (Jonsson et al. 2008). Both are eukaryotic and multicellular. The macroscopic
lichens even survived UV—C exposure during their two-week ﬂight in LEO.

Except for the two free ﬂying satellite missions LDEF and EURECA that were planned to
stay in orbit for approximately 1 year and With LDEF accidentally remaining in space for nearly
6 years, exposure of most exobiological experiments in space did not last longer than

in LEO. We present in this paper the different steps of experiment preparation for EXPOSE,
Which started With experiment proposals and the selection by peer groups. Studies in the space
simulation facilities in order to select suitable specimens, deﬁne the ideal exposure conditions
and develop the appropriate ﬂight hardware followed as preparation for the launch of EXPOSE
t0 the ISS and the installation outside of the ISS. Valves and lids (only EXPOSE-E) were opened
by telecommand (TC), starting the exposure of the EXPOSE samples to the space environment.

Astrobiological Experiments on EXPOSE
In 1996, ESA issued the ﬁrst Announcement of Opportunities (A0) for Externally Mounted
Payloads for the ﬁrst Utilisation Phase of the 188. The following locations for external
payloads (Fig. l) are offered by the fully assembled 188:
° the Truss segment 3 (S3) of the ISS (USOS Truss Segment and EXPRESS Pallets
(Fig. 1A);
° the European Columbus module providing the External Payload Facility (CEPF) With the
European Technology Exposure Facility EuTEF (Fig. 1B);
° the Russian module Zvezda providing 2 external attachment points (URM-D-platform)
(Fig. 1C); and
° the J apanese Experiment Module providing the Exposed Facility (JEM-EF) (Fig. 1D).
Depending on the location 011 the 188, different ﬁelds of View are given due to the
shading effects by 188 elements and structures. The S3 has four sites (two zenith, two
nadir), While CEPF consists of two structures on the starboard cone of the European
Columbus module, each for two external payloads. One of the four sites has zenith View,
While all others are restricted by their orientation and the ISS structure itself (Wilson 2003).

Astrobiological Experiments on EXPOSE-R

In response to ESA’S call in 1996 for ”Externally mounted payloads for lst utilization

phase” on the International Space Station (188), nearly 100 proposals were submitted from

different ﬁelds of basic research and application, such as technology, space science, life

science including exobiology, physical science and Earth observation (Seibert 1998). After

peer review and technology feasibility and accommodation study, eight astrobiological

experiments were selected. These were targeted either towards

° the understanding of the stability of organic molecules in space in connection with
processes of chemical evolution in space (Brack et al. 1999, Cottin et al. 2008), or

° the assessment of the resistance of microbial model systems and biomolecules t0 the
different parameters of space (Horneck et al. 1999) (Table 2).

The latter group consisting of six experiments formed the ROSE (Response of
Organisms to Space Environment) consortium under the coordination of DLR. This
international ROSE consortium has been composed of scientists from different European

countries, from USA and from Japan. In the following years, the ﬂight hardware, i.e. the
EXPOSE-facility, was designed by BSA in close consultation with the different
astrobiology science teams.

A dedicated Experiment Veriﬁcation Test Program for the EXPOSE experiments
(EXPOSE-EVT) was established (C. Panitz, in preparation) and supported by BSA in order
to achieve the necessary ﬂight readiness of the experiments and — at the same time — use
the results of the tests as feed back into the hardware design process. It included activities
as follows:

° assessment of the desiccation and UV radiation resistance of the different species of
ROSE in order to select suitable organisms for the ﬂight;

° determination of the acceptable temperature ranges;

° assessment of the biocompatibility 0f the different samples and materials;

° selection of analytical methods for the different biological endpoints to be investigated;

° tests of sample preparation techniques for the space experiment;

° measurement of UV—dose effect relationship for different polychromatic spectral ranges
in order to choose suitable ﬁlter combinations for the ﬂight unit;

° deﬁnition of the optical requirements and

0 optimization of analytical methods for the different biological endpoints adapted to the
small sample volumes required by the space hardware.

The EVTs were performed within the Planetary and Space Simulation Facilities (\IJ PSIs)
at DLR and have provided an in-depth understanding of the responses of the different test
systems to selected simulated space parameters (Douki and Cadet 2003, Fekete et al. 2004,
2005, Ronté et al. 2004, Hegediis et al. 2006, Moeller et al. 2007).

Because the initially planned site for the installation of the EXPOSE facility, the
EXPRESS Pallet 0f the 188, was not provided in time, ESA ﬁnally selected as alternative
solution the URM-D platform on the Russian Zvezda module of the 188 (Fig. l) as
attachment site of the EXPOSE-facility. Without changing the original structure and sample
exposure design, the EXPOSE concept was adapted for accommodation on the URM-D
platform and the facility now called EXPOSE-R was developed. In the course of
negotiations on the EXPOSE-R mission on Zvezda, a set of Russian biological samples
provided by the Institute of Biomedical Problems (IMBP) was added to the experiments on
EXPOSE-R. This included bacterial spores, fungal spores, plant seeds, and eggs of lower
crustacean and cryptobiotic larvae. Passive dosimeters for ionizing radiation measurement
and the active radiation measuring instrument R3D complemented the chemical and
biological experiments. EXPOSE-R was successfully launched to the 188 on November 26,
2008 from Baikonur on board of a Progress capsule (http://www.esa.int/esaHS/SEM
AVT9WYNF_indeX_0.html).

Astrobiological Experiments on EXPOSE-E

As an alternative solution for the original ﬂight module of EXPOSE, ESA decided to move
EXPOSE t0 the European Technology Exposure Facility (EuTEF), one of the four CEPF on
Columbus (Fig. 1), together with eight other external instruments. The hardware of
EXPOSE, now called EXPOSE-E, was adapted for accommodation on a bracket 0n the
EuTEF platform, providing Zenith orientation of the samples. ESA issued another A0 in
2004 for a second batch of exposure experiments to be performed in space. The
astrobiological experiments selected after peer reView for ﬂight on EXPOSE-E are listed
in Table 3. They are performed by international groups of scientists and are intended to

fungi), plant seeds and microbial endolithic communities in their natural habitat. Upon
request of the Principal Investigators, during an Experimenter Working Group Meeting in
February 2006 at ESA, dosimeters for cosmic ionizing radiation and solar UV radiation
were added to EXPOSE-E (Table 3). The dosimetric systems were derived from
experiments on EXPOSE-R (ROSE 3 experiment SPORES — Spores in artiﬁcial
meteorites) as well as from BIOPAN experiments on the FOTON satellite (Reitz et a1.
2002, Sancho et a1. 2007, Palfalvi et a1. 2007, 2008, Fehér and Palfalvi 2008, Damasso et
a1. 2009).
Astrobiological Relevance of the Experiments on EXPOSE-E and EXPOSE-R
With the experiments onboard 0f the EXPOSE facilities various aspects of astrobiology
are investigated that cannot be sufﬁciently approached by use of laboratory facilities on
ground (Table 2 and 3). The chemical set of experiments is designed to reach a better
understanding of the role of interstellar, cometary and planetary chemistry in the origin of
life (Brack et a1. 1999, Cottin et a1. 2008). Comets and meteorites are interpreted as
exogenous sources of prebiotic molecules on the early Earth. From studies on the chemical
evolution, survival, destruction and modiﬁcation of complex organics, e.g., PAHs,
fullerenes and complex aromatic networks in outer space experimental clues Will be
obtained on the photochemistry of these compounds in the interstellar and interplanetary
medium. Data obtained from the studies on complex organics 0f cometary interest Will
support the interpretation of the future in-situ data, to be obtained from the Rosetta mission
after landing on Comet 67P/Churyum0V-Gerasimenko in 2014 (ESA 2008). Finally the
chemical experiments Will contribute to the understanding of the chemical processes on
Saturn’s moon Titan and possible analogies t0 the prebiotic chemistry on the early Earth
(Raulin 2007).

The biology experiments use the full extraterrestrial spectrum of solar UV radiation
and suitable cut—off ﬁlters to study both, the role of the ozone layer in protecting our
biosphere and the likelihood of resistant terrestrial microorganisms and microbial
communities to survive in outer space. The latter studies will provide experimental data
to the hypothesis of lithopansperrnia (Nicholson 2009), i.e. the interplanetary transfer of
life Via meteorites, and they will provide basic data to planetary protection issues, i.e. the
need to prevent contamination of target planets, e.g. Mars by terrestrial microorganisms
(Horneck et al. 2007). To get better insight into the habitability of Mars, one set of samples
will be exposed to simulated Martian conditions (UV—radiation climate, pressure,
atmosphere), with and without a protective cover of simulated Martian regolith. The
biological test samples selected are hardy representatives of bacteria, Archaea, lichens,
fungi and plant seeds, i.e. of various branches of life, also in their natural communities.
Most types have already demonstrated their resistance to outer space during short term
missions, e.g. on board of the ESA BIOPAN facility (Horneck et al. 2001, Rettberg et al.
2004, Sancho et al. 2007)

In summary, all data achieved from the astrobiological experiments on both EXPOSE
missions will add to our understanding of the origin and evolution of life on Earth and on
the possibility of its distribution in space or origin elsewhere.

Development of EXPOSE Flight Hardware

Following the ESA A0 in 1996 and the ﬁnal selection of experiments, four payloads for
external pallets were developed by ESA (Seibert 1998; Wilson 2003): a Technology
Exposure Facility (TEF), Solar Packages with three experiments on a coarse pointing
device, an Atomic Clock experiment (ACES) and a Space Exposure Biological Assembly
(SEBA) to accommodate the EXPOSE facility for the astrobiology experiments (Table 2)
and the MATROSHKA facility, a human phantom to determine the depth dose distribution
in astronauts during Extra Vehicular Activity (EVA) (Reitz and Berger 2006, Reitz et al.
2009). SEBA with EXPOSE and MATROSHKA was foreseen to be accommodated on a
zenith oriented pallet of the ISS Truss structure Via the EXPRESS (EXpedite the
PRocessing of Experiments to Space Station) Pallet concept to be provided by Brazil
(NASA 1999) (Fig. 1). EXPRESS Pallets would allow installation and exchange of
individual experiments by EVA. A central Standard Payload Computer and a Power
Distribution Unit to support the two independent experiment units EXPOSE and
MATROSHKA were planned as part of SEBA. To obtain deﬁned irradiances of solar UV,
which requires vertical insolation of the samples, EXPOSE should be mounted on a
dedicated sun pointing device. A lid system was designed for remote control that
provided insolation of the samples during the sun-pointing phases only. SEBA was
scheduled to be installed on the 188 in 2001. However, the EXPRESS Pallet was not
provided in time, and ﬁnally a decision was made to move EXPOSE to the European
Technology Exposure Facility (EuTEF), one of the four CEPF on Columbus (Fig. 1).
An adapter bracket was designed to allow zenith orientation of the EXPOSE samples, but
without sun pointing ability. When the delivery of the Columbus module with its four
external platforms was delayed too, a timely access to 188 for EXPOSE and its
astrobiological experiments seemed to be possible only by a Russian carrier to the URM-
D platform on the Russian Zvezda module. At the end, 2 EXPOSE facilities were provided
by ESA: one, EXPOSE-R to be installed at the URM-D platform of Zvezda, and a second

unit, EXPOSE-E, the original ﬂight unit, as part of EuTEF. In both cases, the lids were
deemed no longer necessary, because of lack of a sun-pointing device. While EXPOSE-E
construction and tests were already too advanced for any changes, lids were consequently
removed from the EXPOSE-R core instrument. In addition, the trays of EXPOSE-R were
designed to be exchanged in ﬂight by EVA, while the completely loaded EXPOSE-E
facility will be returned together with EuTEF by the Space Shuttle after completion of the
mission.

The astrobiological experiments selected (Table 2 and 3) required a multi-user unit
designed to accommodate a variety of biological and chemical samples. Though all
samples required access to space conditions, above all space vacuum and/or solar UV
radiation, individual samples needed deﬁned exposure conditions: different optical ﬁlters
for wavelength selection and/or attenuation of solar UV radiation, as well as sample
carriers speciﬁcally adapted to the sample requirements. For this, the EXPOSE facility
was designed and developed by the payload developer Kayser-Threde, Munich, Germany,
based on the heredity of previous exobiological exposure devices, ﬂown on Spacelab,
EURECA and BIOPAN/Foton missions (Demets et al. 2005, Baglioni et al. 2007) and in
close consultation with the Principal Investigators. EXPOSE has a box-shaped core
structure providing heating systems, temperature and UV sensors and systems for ground
telemetry, communication and commanding. Three sample trays, each with four square sample
compartments of approximately 77 X 77 mm2 inner widths and 36 mm inner depth are mounted
in parallel on top of the core structure (Fig. 2). To allow access to space vacuum, some
compartments of each tray are connected by a venting line to a common valve which is
remotely operated by telecommand (TC). In space, these valves of the trays are opened by
TC. Other compartments, which contain a defined atmosphere (e.g. simulated Martian
atmosphere) or which harbor control samples kept at atmospheric pressure in inert gas
(e.g. argon), are disconnected from the venting line and hermetically sealed to maintain
the pressure and composition of the inner gas provided during closure of the compartment
or tray.

The samples are accommodated in at least two layers of sample carriers (one top
carrier for UV exposure of the samples and one or two carrier(s) below hosting the
dark control samples) that are integrated into the compartments (Fig. 3). Depending on
the type of carrier, up to 64 samples are accommodated in one carrier. Each compartment
is covered by an optical ﬁlter frame carrying long-pass ﬁlters for wavelength selection
(> 110 nm,>200 nm) as well as neutral density ﬁlters of different transmissions (100%,
1%, 0.1%, 0.01%, 0.0001%). The compartments of the ROSE experiments in EXPOSE-R
(Table 2) and of the biological experiments in EXPOSE-E except SEEDS (Table 3) are
additionally covered by 8 mm thick MgFZ or quartz (Suprasil) windows. A maximum of
sixteen different combinations of optical neutral density ﬁlters and long-pass ﬁlters are
possible for each compartment to modulate the incident UV intensity and wavelength
range.

The core structure of each EXPOSE facility provides common functionalities and
services: a control unit for lid-motors (only in EXPOSE-E, where the lids are part of the
thermal control system and closed if the temperature rises above the upper acceptable
temperature limit for the samples of 530C) and valves, data acquisition, four UV—B sensors
located at the four corners of the facility, one radiometer, a thermal control system based on
two independent heater circuits, multilayer insulators, coatings, an electrical interface to the
EuTEF / URM-D data handling and power unit and the mechanical interface to EuTEF /
URM-D. The EXPOSE actuators are controlled by software Via the experiment control unit

Flight Mission Protocol

EXPOSE-E Flight Preparation

EXPOSE-E was scheduled to be launched to the ISS together with the European Columbus
module and its external EuTEF platform in December 2007 (Space Shuttle ﬂight STS 122).
The individual samples of the experiments (Table 3) were prepared in the laboratories of the
Principal Investigators and transported to DLR for integration into the trays of EXPOSE-E.
Two sets of samples were provided: one set for the ﬂight experiment and one set to be
accommodated in an identical set of trays for the mission ground reference experiment. The
latter trays are used to follow the environmental data of the ﬂight unit (e.g. temperature
proﬁle, vacuum exposure, UV radiation) using the \11 PSI facilities at DLR.

After assembly, two trays of EXPOSE-E (tray 1 and 3) were ﬁlled with nitrogen at ambient
pressure and closed. They were evacuated after installation outside of the Columbus facility at
the beginning of the mission, thereby exposing all samples in those two trays to the space
vacuum of LEO; MgFZ windows allow transmission of short wavelength solar UV. The
third tray (tray 2) was designed to provide a simulated Martian climate (atmosphere,
pressure, UV radiation spectrum). After sample integration it was ﬁlled with a simulated
Martian atmospheric gas with a ﬁnal pressure inside the tray of 103 Pa and composed of
1.6% Argon, 0.15% Oxygen and 2.7% Nitrogen in C02 and hermetically closed. To simulate
the Martian UV radiation climate, long-pass ﬁlters cutting off wavelengths <200 nm were
used. All samples in this tray are determined to remain in this simulated Mars atmosphere
for the whole mission. To prevent an accidental opening of the valve during mission
operation, this function was inhibited for telemetry of EXPOSE-E. A ﬁnal functionality test
of R3D, the only active experiment on EXPOSE-E, proved full functionality and correct
integration of the instrument.

On July 19, 2007, the three trays ready for transportation to Kennedy Space Center (KSC)
were presented to BSA and shipment release was granted. At KSC, the EXPOSE-E core facility
was already installed on the EuTEF platform and tested. The three trays were integrated and the
complete EuTEF platform (Fig. 4) was installed into the Cargo bay of STS—122, Space Shuttle
Atlantis, together with the SOLAR platform next to the Columbus module, at launch pad 39A.
EXPOSE-E Mission
Launch of EXPOSE-E was scheduled for December 6, 2007 with STS—122. A problem with
two Engine Cut Off sensors led to a postponement of the launch. Launch date was ﬁnally
set to February 7, 2008 and Atlantis took off from KSC at 07:45 pm. GMT. On February
15, 2008, during the third EVA of the STS-122 mission, EuTEF including EXPOSE-E was
successfully installed on the starboard cone of the Columbus module (Fig. 5). Two days
later, on February 17, 2008 at 03:10:30 GMT, the EXPOSE-E Facility Support Center of

the MicrograVity User Support Center (MUSC) at DLR in Germany contacted EXPOSE-E
Via telemetry during check out.

On February 20, 2008, at 08:28:15 GMT, MUSC at DLR commanded EXPOSE-E
through the commissioning phase, opening the valves of trays 1 and 3, opening all three
lids and activating R3D. The status of EXPOSE-E was nominal except for one pressure
sensor of tray 3, indicating no pressure decrease in that tray. Because two sensors at the
valve of tray 3 conﬁrmed the open status of the valve, its pressure sensor was assumed to
show a malfunction. Housekeeping temperature data from the siX temperature sensors and
UV data from the four UV sensors and the radiometer as well as science data form R3D
were down-linked successfully. Nearly 15 years after the ERA Mission 0n EURECA, a new
long term astrobiological exposure experiment was successfully launched and is operational
in space for at least 1.5 years, exposing more than 470 individual samples to selected space
conditions. The retrieval of EXPOSE-E with the whole EuTEF platform is currently
scheduled for August 2009 with Shuttle ﬂight STS 128 — 17A.

EXPOSE-R Flight Preparation

Launch of EXPOSE-R t0 the 188 was scheduled for November 2008 from Baikonur with a
Progress module. As for EXPOSE-E, for the astrobiology experiments (Table 2) two sets of
samples were prepared by the Principal Investigators in their laboratories, and then
transported to the DLR for integration into the trays. More than 1200 samples were
accommodated in the EXPOSE-R ﬂight unit (Fig. 3) as well as in the ground control unit.
The compartments were closed in an argon atmosphere, capturing the inert gas at
atmospheric pressure inside the trays. It has been shown in previous experiments and
during the EVTs that during storage argon as well as nitrogen are less aggressive to the
samples than air, probably by preventing oxidative damage. The completely equipped and
closed trays of the ﬂight unit were handed over to BSA and Kayser—Threde on August 14,
2008 for integration into the EXPOSE-R core facility. After integration into the core facility
and ﬁnal testing, the complete EXPOSE-R was transported to its launch destination
Baikonur on October 25, 2008.

EXPOSE-R Mission

EXPOSE-R was launched successfully as scheduled on November 26, 2008, 12:38 GMT,
with Progress 31-P. After docking with the 188 on November 30, EXPOSE-R was
transferred from the Progress capsule into the Russian Zvezda module. During the
preparation of EXPOSE-R for external installation, the bolt 0f tray 2, which is required for
later exchange of the tray, broke. The problem was resolved by fastening tray 2 in a
different way using screws available on board of the 188. Hence, the installation of
EXPOSE-R 0n the URM-D platform of Zvezda started as scheduled during the EVA on
December 23, 2008. EXPOSE-R was successfully attached to the external platform by the
Russian Flight Engineer Yury V. Lonchakov and the NASA Commander E. Michael Fincke
during this EVA (Fig. 6). However a failure in the power connection led to the decision to
return EXPOSE-R back into the Zvezda module of the 188. The power failure was only
understood and resolved when the EVA was over. EXPOSE-R had to wait for the next EVA
on March 10, 2009, to be installed on the URM-D platform. In the meantime, the broken
bolt 0f tray 2 was exchanged. During the March 2009 EVA performed by the same two
astronauts, successful power and data connection was monitored online at MUSC, DLR,
and telemetry on health and valve status received. Starting March 11, 16:43 GMT, the

opening of the 3 valves in 2 minute time steps by telecommand was followed on ground.

EXPOSE-R and its more than 1,000 samples have gone operational.

After the planned 1 to 1.5 year mission, each of the three trays of EXPOSE-R will be
removed from the core facility and returned to Earth by a Soyuz module, leaving the
EXPOSE-R core facility on the URM-D platform in prospect of reloading with a new set of
trays with a new set of astrobiological experiments.

Discussion and Conclusions

The EXPOSE facilities accommodate more than 470 (EXPOSE-E) and 1,200 (EXPOSE-R)
samples from 8 international scientiﬁc groups each. For both facilities, Experiment Veriﬁcation
Tests (EVTs) proved necessary and helpﬁil to successfully customize the hardware and the
requirements of the experiments. The bi010 gical and chemical samples varied in their demands
on the interfaces to the EXPOSE facilities, especially the sample carriers. Sample ﬁxation and
accommodation strategies were veriﬁed and ﬁt checks performed. In addition biocompatibility
0f the samples with each other and the materials of the facility was tested. Pre—ﬂight tests with
candidate samples under simulated space parameters were performed. They are the conditio
Sine qua non to allow selection of the best suited samples and to increase the scientiﬁc
outcome of the post-ﬂight analysis and its interpretation (Onofri et a1. 2008).

Therefore, extensive Experiment Veriﬁcation Tests (EVTs) are necessary for a successful
and scientiﬁc valuable space experiment. One requisite for successful pre-ﬂight EVTs,
besides space conditions simulating facilities, is the availability of the ﬂight identical
hardware. Only the timely availability of hardware for tests allows a straight-forward
adaptation of the final hardware with respect to the samples carriers and their
biocompatibility. For EXPOSE-E and EXPOSE-R, a complete additional set of hardware
for the ground controls was provided by ESA. These sets are now used for the parallel
Mission Ground Reference Experiment, which runs in the Planetary and Space Simulation
Facilities at DLR. For early EVTs the EXPOSE hardware was not yet available. In those
cases, the hardware of past missions, e.g. EURECA, was used. Likewise important for a
careful preparation of the ﬂight experiments is the pre-ﬂight performance of Experiment
Sequence Tests (ESTs) that rehearses the ﬁnal call for and provision of ﬂight and ground
samples, the ﬁnal accommodation procedures and proves equally important for a successful
logistics and integration of a high number of samples of several international groups. With

both EXPOSE facilities being successfully in space, extensive pre-ﬂight test programs were
performed, which increase the chances for a successful study of the biological responses
and chemical processes under real space conditions.

Future exposure facilities for astrobiology experiments could be further improved. In
most cases, astrobiology experiments try to simulate as much as possible the conditions
experienced by organic chemical and biological matters when traveling with comets or
asteroids or when being exposed to extra-terrestrial conditions. In this case, low
temperatures, far below 00C, are desired, whilst maintaining a full exposure to solar UV
radiation. This explains why a future evolution of a facility like EXPOSE should be
provided with some cooling devices, either passive, like heat pipes and radiators
conductively linked to the experiment trays, or semi-active, like thermoelectric junctions
(Peltier) linked to heat exchangers. In addition, sun pointing devices and sample
compartments with embedded temperature sensors should be part of future development,
as well as active and passive dosimetric systems for UV, Visible light and ionizing radiation,
able to also determine the angular position of the sun. A pressure measurement system,
providing real-time in ﬂight environmental data Via telemetry, is of interest for the scientists
and for mission parallel ground based simulations.

EXPOSE-type facilities might be used in the near future as “test-bed” for experiments in
support of upcoming planetary exploration missions. The design and development of the
mobile astrobiology package Pasteur to be operated on the Martian surface during the
ExoMars mission (Vago and Kminek 2007), will most probably require testing of materials,
electronic components and mechanical devices that will have to be operated continuously
when exposed for long time to extraterrestrial conditions (low pressure or vacuum, large
temperature variations, high radiation, electric and magnetic ﬁelds, etc.). Similar tests will
also become necessary for any future long term operation on the Moon.

Looking at the near term plans of BSA for Mars exploration, it is clear that the ﬁrst missions
(ExoMars Pasteur, Mars Sample Return) shall bring to the Martian surface a set of
instrumentation. Their bioload needs to be controlled and reduced according to the COSPAR
Planetary Protection Guidelines (http://cosparhq.cnes.fr/Scistr/PPPolicy(20-July-08).pdi), i.e.
resulting in a reduction of living terrestrial microorganisms, and cleaned from Earth-organic
agents, in the attempt to avoid contamination when measuring and investigating the Martian
regolith and rock characteristics. These planetary protection issues are at the moment being
investigated, e.g. in the experiments PROTECT and ADAPT on board of EXPOSE-E
(Table 3). Similar studies should be fostered, because exposure platforms like EXPOSE might
be useful for validation, qualiﬁcation and testing of materials or technical devices in
preparation of missions to Moon or Mars.
