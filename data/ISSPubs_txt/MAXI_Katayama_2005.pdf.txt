Abstract

Monitor 0f All-sky X-ray Image (MAXI) is an astrophysical payload for the J apanese Experiment Module (Kibo) 0n
the International Space Station (ISS). MAXI is designed for full-sky monitoring in the 05—30 keV X-ray band.

The Solid-state Slit Camera (SSC) is the X-ray CCD Camera for the MAXI mission. We have developed an
engineering model (EM) 0f the SSC. Combined with the EM electronics, we achieved 10w readout noise (~ 5e‘ rms)
and good energy resolution (150 eV at 5.9 keV).

We also examine the energy scale and the energy resolution as a function of energy using our calibration system.
From these results, we conclude that the performance of the SSC-EM almost fulﬁlls our requirements and that the ﬁnal
performance goals will be Obtained in the ﬂight model.
