Abstract
Based on the experience in operation of Russian space stations Salut, Mir and International space station ISS the station’s water
balance data, parameters and characteristics of the systems for water recovery have been obtained. Using the data design analysis
an integrated water supply system for an interplanetary space station has been performed. A packaged physical/Chemical system
for water supply is composed of an integrated system for water recovery from humidity condensate, green house condensate,
water from carbon dioxide reduction system and condensate from urine system; a system for water reclamation from urine;
hygiene water processing system and a water storage system. The take off mass of the packaged water supply system (including
expendables, redundancy hardware, equivalent mass of power consumption and of thermal control) is appropriate for Mars
missions. The international space station is indispensable for verifying innovative processes and new water recovery systems
intended for missions to Mars.
