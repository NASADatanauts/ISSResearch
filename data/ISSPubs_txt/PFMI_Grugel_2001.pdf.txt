Abstract

Porosity in the form of “bubbles and pipes” can occur during controlled directional solidiﬁcation
processing of metal alloys. It is detrimental to material properties, and also precludes obtaining meaningful
scientiﬁc results in the materials developmental context. On Earth, buoyancy effects force an initiated bubble to
rise through the liquid and burst at the surface, resulting in a uniform casting. This is not likely to occur in a
microgravity environment and, unfortunately, a number of experiments conducted in microgravity have suffered
from porosity effects. The current investigation is a systematic effort towards understanding porosity formation
and mobility during controlled directional solidiﬁcation in a microgravity environment. This will be
investigated by utilizing the pure transparent material, suooinonitrile (SCN), as well as SCN “alloyed” with
water, in conjunction with a translating temperature gradient stage so that direct observation and recording of
pore generation and mobility can be made. The talk will cover the porosity problem, the details of the proposed
experiments and the experimental hardware, and the expectations from the microgravity experiments.
Introduction

One particularly signiﬁcant innovation in materials processing has been the development of the
directional solidiﬁcation (DS) technique. Brieﬂy, it is a controlled procedure, where the temperature gradients
and growth velocity are carefully manipulated along a particular aXis (aXis of symmetry) that in turn produces a
uniform, aligned miorostruoture. Figures land 21, show the microstructure of an Aluminum- Bismuth alloy that
was directionally solidiﬁed; it is well established that such processing promotes superior, material propertiesz'lo.
This advantage was ﬁrst recognized in the late 1930's11'13, reﬁned in 196014, and by 1966 had evolved to the
production of single crystal turbine blades15 . Today, procedures for directional solidiﬁcation of alloys are
developed to the extent that the miorostruotural morphology can be deﬁned, maintained, and reproduced by
controlling the solidiﬁcation parameters of growth velocity (V), temperature gradient (G), and alloy composition
(C0).

It is often the case that convection currents originating in the melt due to density and/or composition
gradients will disrupt growth at the DS solid-liquid interfaoe16’ 17. This subsequently promotes severe
macrosegregation that, in turn, compromises the desired material properties. Noting that convection and other
buoyanoy/sedimentation effects that arise during solidiﬁcation processing are gravity-driven it follows that these
detrimental phenomena would be minimized in a microgravity environment. Consequently, DS experiments
conducted in a microgravity environment provide us with “benchmark” samples that promote our fundamental
knowledge of miorostruotural development and allow more accurate appraisal of current growth theories. It is
thus not surprising that NASA has invested considerable time and effort to this end.

Unfortunately, in a microgravity context, the generation and inclusion of porosity becomes a maj or
drawback. If porosity can be ascribed a collective term it would inoludelg'20 the likes of “wormholes”,
“blowholes”, “pipes”, “rattails”, “pores”, “cavities”, “pinholes”, and “sponge.” The origin of these defects is
generally attributed to gas formation, gas evolution, gas entrapment, and shrinkage during solidiﬁcation of the

“pop” at the surface; obviously this is not necessarily the case in a microgravity environment.

However, in a microgravity environment, thermooapillary forces can play a role in bubble transport and
growth during directional solidiﬁcation. As part of the current studies, we intend to systematically examine the
role of temperature gradients, and other processing parameters, in initiating bubble migration and growth in a
microgravity environment. For example, Figure 321 shows a computed tomography image of an Aluminum -
17.3 weight percent Indium alloy Which was directionally solidiﬁed in the Advanced Gradient Heating Facility
during the 1996 LMS mission21. Some mode of porosity is clearly Visible and it is not likely that any relevant
scientiﬁc analysis can be gained from this sample, or other similar ones.

Figures 4 and 5 show the calculated bubble velocity versus bubble radius as a function of several gravity
levels for two applied temperature gradients. The calculations are informative in that they predict
experimentally tractable bubble sizes and velocities. Furthermore, they give insight to the gravity levels
necessary to distinguish between thermoeapillary phenomena and buoyancy effects

Observation and measurement of bubble migration could lead to 1) an appreciation of holding times
prior to initiating sample translation and 2) a reevaluation of isothermal zones in directional solidiﬁcation
furnaces.

Experimentally, 10mm inside diameter quartz tubes 0n the order 0f 30 em in length Will be ﬁlled With
pure sueeinonitrile and SCN to Which a small amount of water has been added to simulate alloy solidiﬁcation.
To investigate pore formation the sample tubes Will be ﬁlled by, at least, the three following methods. (1)
Pieces of SCN Will be put in the tube. (2) SCN Will be cast into the tube. (3) SCN Will be cast into the tube and

"
"4","then be directionally solidiﬁed. Case 1 ensures porosity in the sample, case 2 allows porosity to develop, and
case 3 is prepared With the intent of minimizing porosity. Each sample tube (Figure 6), Will be outﬁtted With an
effective “spring and piston” assemblage and in-Situ thermocouples. While thermocouples are required for
accurate sample characterization of temperatures and temperature gradients they may also act as sites for pore
nucleation and holding. The sample tubes Will then be inserted in a directional solidiﬁcation furnace (Figure 7),
Which establishes a temperature gradient in the liquid and permits observation of the molten region. The furnace
mounts on g-limit, a MSFC developed Vibration isolation platform; this assemblage ﬁts and is designed to
operate Within the ISS microgravity Glovebox. Porosity, Which forms in the samples, Will be tracked and
recorded With two Video cameras set at 90 degrees from each other and orthogonal to the sample tube.

Conclusions
The PFMI experiment has been initiated to promote our understanding of detrimental porosity formation
and mobility during controlled directional solidiﬁcation processing in a microgravity environment. This Will be
investigated by utilizing a transparent material, succinonitrile (SCN), so that direct observation and recording of
pore generation and mobility during controlled directional solidiﬁcation can be made. Calculations indicate
tractable experimental conditions, e.g., reasonable processing temperatures, reasonable temperature gradients,
reasonable bubble sizes, and measurable bubble velocities. This Will be accomplished under achievable
microgravity levels With discernable effects recorded. The results Will provide insight regarding porosity
formation, bubble movement, and bubble interactions. This information Will be instrumental to future
microgravity directional solidiﬁcation experiments.
