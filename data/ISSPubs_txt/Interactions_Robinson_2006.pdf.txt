ABSTRACT
Background: To provide for orewmember well-being on future exploration missions, understanding
coping strategies that International Space Station (188) orewmembers adopt to mitigate the inherent stress
of long-duration conﬁnement is important. A recent survey of ﬂown astronauts found that the most
commonly reported psychologically enriching aspects of spaceﬂight involved their “Perceptions of
Earth.” 188 orewmembers photograph Earth volitionally and in response to requests from Crew Earth
Observations (CEO) scientists. Our study used objective in-ﬂight data generated by self—initiated
photography to investigate the nature of voluntary activity. Results: Of nearly 200,000 photographs
taken on eight ISS expeditions, 84.5% were orew-initiated. Once a orewmember went to the window for
a CEO request, they were more likely to take photographs for their own interest. Fewer self—initiated
images were taken during, and immediately preceding, major station events. Crewmembers were more
likely to take self—initiated images during periods of greater availability. Analysis indicated some phasing
in patterns of photography during the course of a mission, although no third quarter effect was found.
Discussion: Earth photography offers self—initiated positive activity of possible importance for
salutogenesis (maintenance of well-being) of astronauts on long-duration missions. Scientiﬁc requests for
photography through CEO play an important role in facilitating orew-initiated photography.
