3.1.1. LD-hz't Rate and Processed Event Rate
Each GSC gas counter embodies six carbon—anode cells
for main X—ray detector and the veto cells surrounding
the carbon—anode cells. The cosmiC—ray backgrounds are
screened out on board by applying an anti—coincidence
matrix to hit patterns of all anode signals in each counter.
The efﬁciency of the background reduction depends on the
LD threshold of the read—out signals. The ampliﬁer gains
and LD levels of all the read—out signals are tuned during
the initial veriﬁcation operation.
The background rates of all the 12 GSC counters are
found to have a similar time variation during the entire
observation—operation period. They exhibit clear anti—
