ABSTRACT:
Astronaut photography of cities collected during Apollo, Skylab, Shuttle, Mir, and International Space Station rnissions provides a
useful dataset for urban analysis that complements the satellite data archive. Recent astronaut photography acquired with digital
cameras is now approaching the ground resolutions of commercial satellites such as IKONOS (i.e. less than 6 rn/pixel). Astronaut
photographs are a relevant source of data for urban analyses, particularly for studies that do not have the resources to purchase
cornrnercial-quality data. The CCD image sensors in the cameras currently used for astronaut photography are sensitive to the
infrared portion of the electromagnetic spectrum, but infrared signal is ﬁltered out above 700 am. As such, the digital camera data
contain less information on actively synthesizing vegetation than they would with an infrared signal included. We present an analysis
of aboveground biornass (i.e. actively photosynthesizing vegetation) derived from astronaut photography of the Paris, France
metropolitan area acquired on April 24, 2002 using a Kodak DCS 760C electronic still camera aboard the International Space
Station. The accuracy of biomass estirnation obtained from the digital camera data is demonstrated by comparison with Advanced
Spaceborne Therrnal Ernission and Reﬂection Radiometer Visible to near infrared data for Paris acquired on April 8, 2002.
Correlations of bands between the two instruments allow interpretation of the identiﬁed vegetation and soil classes. Collection of
astronaut photography over global urban centers is ongoing and planned for future orbital missions, and will be a useful addition to
ongoing studies of urban ecosystem change, sustainability, and resilience.
