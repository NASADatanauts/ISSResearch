In VIVO Footprinting Reveals Unique Cis-Elements
and Different Modes of HypOXIC Induction in Maize
Adh1 and Adh2

The transcriptional activation of maize alcohol dehydrogenase-1 (Adh1) and alcohol dehydrogenase-Z (Adh2) is
accompanied by changes in the chromatin structure within the 5’-flanking region of each gene. The positions of
DNA-binding factors bound to the 5’-ﬂanking regions were determined by in vivo dimethyl sulfate footprinting of
maize suspension cultures over 8 hours of hypoxic induction. In Adh1 there are two types of DNA-binding factors
associated with the promoter region. One set of factors is constitutively associated with the cis-regulatory anaerobic
response element, whereas two additional factors bind only after Adh1 has been induced by hypoxic stress.
Returning hypoxically stressed cells to an aerobic environment restores the dimethyl sulfate footprint observed for
the uninduced Adh1 gene. In contrast, all of the factors bound to the 5’-flanking region of Adh2 are constitutively
present and unchanged by hypoxia. There is one footprint site common to both Adh1 and Adh2, but it is not an
anaerobic response-like element.

the utility of a cell culture line: (1) how closely the Adh1
