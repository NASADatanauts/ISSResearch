The effect of space flight on production of the antibiotic actinomycin D by Streptomyces plicatus WC56452 was
examined onboard the US Space Shuttle mission STS-80. Paired space flight and ground control samples were
similarly prepared using identical hardware, media, and inoculum. The cultures were grown in defined and complex
media under dark, anaerobic, thermally controlled (20°C) conditions with samples fixed after 7 and 12 days in orbit,
and viable residuals maintained through landing at 17 days, 15 h. Postflight analyses indicated that space flight had
reduced the colony-forming unit (CFU) per milliliter count of S. plicatus and increased the specific productivity (pg
CFU‘1 ) of actinomycin D. The antibiotic compound itself was not affected, but its production time course was altered
in space. Viable flight samples also maintained their sporulation ability when plated on agar medium postflight, while
the residual ground controls did not sporulate.
