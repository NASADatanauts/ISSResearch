Liquid foams are omnipresent in everyday life, but little is understood about their
properties. On Earth, the liquid rapidly drains out of the foam because of gravity, leading
to rupture of the thin liquid films between bubbles. Several questions arise: are liquid foams
more stable in microgravity environments? Can pure liquids, such as water, form stable
foams in microgravity whereas they do not on Earth? In order to answer these questions,
we performed experiments both in parabolic flights and in the International Space Station.

which is gas transfer be—
tween the bubbles due to their diﬁerent internal pres-
sures. Both processes lead to an increase of the bubble
radius with time, but they are not easy to distinguish.
A third ageing mechanism is the gravity—driven drain-
age of liquid between the bubbles. rlhis removes liquid
from the foam and inﬂuences both coarsening and
coalescence. In order to disentangle the different ef-
fects, one should ideally suppress drainage. Performing
experiments in microgravity is a unique way to study
foams containing a substantial amount of liquid. Indeed,
obtaining stable foams with large liquid fraction gb (gb
> 20%) on Earth is impossible; various hydrodynamic
instabilities even accelerate drainage [1].
""lhis prevents the study of very wet foams, formed
at the beginning of the foam life and thus an important
step in foaming processes. Furthermore, wet foams show
' h a particularly interesting transition when the bubbles are
closely packed, but still spherical (F ig. 1). For disordered
foams this “jamming transition” occurs at a liquid frac—
tion gb"" z 36%. For smaller gb, the bubbles are distorted
into polyhedra and the foam behaves like a soft solid.
By contrast, at larger (/5 the foam behaves like a Viscous
liquid since the bubbles are separated by enough liquid
