Si05Ge05 suggests crystal growth before quenching. X—ray trans—
Si feed mission tomography reveals various sectional views, including the
freezing interface, and some images provide us with clearer
interface shapes as shown in Fig. 3(a).
Ge at% Curvature of that of the present experiment is about
99 0.06 mm—1. In the ﬁrst experiment, it was observed to be
0.17 mm—1. Therefore, the interface curvature is about 1/3 of that
of the ﬁrst experiment. It is interesting whether the interface
90 curvature is related to the growth length, as the two—dimensional
TLZ growth model [10] suggested an increase in freezing interface
81 curvature in accordance with crystal growth. If dependency of the
interface curvature on the growth length is made clear, it gives us
a great clue for the correctness of the two—dimensional growth
72 model. Radial concentration proﬁles also reﬂect freezing interface
shape, and a more detailed discussion will be carried out along
with radial concentration proﬁles in the later section.

ﬁgure, Ge concentration proﬁle along the center axis (<>) is

right—side peripheral region 4 mm away from the center (O) and
another along the left—side peripheral region 4 mm away from the
45 center (A). Average Ge concentration for the whole of the crystal is
49.8 i 2.5 at%. Average concentration is nearer to 50 at% compared
36 with the ﬁrst experiment, but concentration variation of i 2.5 at%
becomes worse despite heater temperature adjustment for emis—
sivity change of the cartridge surface. When we consider the
27 origins of worse concentration variation, mismatch of the timing
for the correction of emissivity change is hit; soaking period was
