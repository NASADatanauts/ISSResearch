Abstract
Effects of 3-month exposure to microgravity environment on the expression of genes and proteins in mouse brain were
studied. Moreover, responses of neurobiological parameters, nerve growth factor (NGF) and brain derived neurotrophic
factor (BDNF), were also evaluated in the cerebellum, hippocampus, cortex, and adrenal glands. Spaceflight-related changes
in gene and protein expression were observed. Biological processes of the up-regulated genes were related to the immune
response, metabolic process, and/or inflammatory response. Changes of cellular components involving in microsome and
vesicular fraction were also noted. Molecular function categories were related to various enzyme activities. The biological
processes in the down-regulated genes were related to various metabolic and catabolic processes. Cellular components
were related to cytoplasm and mitochondrion. The down-regulated molecular functions were related to catalytic and
oxidoreductase activities. Up-regulation of 28 proteins was seen following spaceflight vs. those in ground control. These
proteins were related to mitochondrial metabolism, synthesis and hydrolysis of ATP, calcium/calmodulin metabolism,
nervous system, and transport of proteins and/or amino acids. Down-regulated proteins were related to mitochondrial
metabolism. Expression of NGF in hippocampus, cortex, and adrenal gland of wild type animal tended to decrease following
spaceflight. As for pleiotrophin transgenic mice, spaceflight-related reduction of NGF occured only in adrenal gland.
Consistent trends between various portions of brain and adrenal gland were not observed in the responses of BDNF to
spaceflight. Although exposure to real microgravity influenced the expression of a number of genes and proteins in the
brain that have been shown to be involved in a wide spectrum of biological function, it is still unclear how the functional
properties of brain were influenced by 3-month exposure to microgravity.
