Abstract—For estimating radiation risk in space ﬂights it is necessary to determine radiation dose obtained
by critical organs of a human body. For this purpose the experiments With human body models are carried
out onboard spacecraft. These models represent phantoms equipped With passive and active radiation detec—
tors Which measure dose distributions at places of location of critical organs. The dosimetric Liulin—5 tele—
scope is manufactured With using three silicon detectors for studying radiation conditions in the spherical tis—
sue—equiValent phantom on the Russian segment of the International space station (ISS). The purpose of the
experiment With Liulin—5 instrument is to study dynamics of the dose rate and particle ﬂuX in the phantom,
as well as variations of radiation conditions on the [SS over long time intervals depending on a phase of the
solar activity cycle, orbital parameters, and presence of solar energetic particles. The Liulin—5 dosimeter mea—
sures simultaneously the dose rate and ﬂuxes of charged particles at three depths in the radial channel of the
phantom, as well as the linear energy transfer. The paper presents the results of measurements of dose rate
and particle ﬂuxes caused by various radiation ﬁeld components on the [SS during the period from J une 2007
till December 2009.
