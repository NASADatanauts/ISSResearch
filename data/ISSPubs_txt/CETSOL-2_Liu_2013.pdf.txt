Abstract
Microgravity offers a unique opportunity to achieve solidiﬁcation in the limit of diffusive transport. Directional solidiﬁcation exper—
iments in Al—7 wt.% Si alloys were carried out under such conditions on board the International Space Station in orbit around the Earth.
Microstructural Characterizations include the elongation factor and equivalent diameter of the dendritic grains, together With the den—
drite arm spacing and the percentage of eutectic. The experimental investigations reveal that coarse randomly oriented dendritic grains
promote non—uniform distribution of eutectic and enhance intergranular segregation. The columnar—to—equiaxed transition (CET)
observed in the dendritic grain structure of the reﬁned alloys, sharp or progressive, is deﬁned and characterized based on the proﬁle
of the averaged elongation factor. Progressive CET is revealed by an intermediate zone Where elongated and equiaxed dendritic grains
coexist, sandwiched between the columnar and the equiaxed zones. Fragmentation is also observed in non—reﬁned alloy experiments by
electron backscattered diffraction analyses. Capillary—driven detachment during coarsening is suggested to explain this ﬁnding, while den—
drite fragments cannot cause CET under microgravity because of the absence of convection. This unique set of well—characterized exper—
iments serve as benchmark data for direct numerical simulation of structures and segregations.
