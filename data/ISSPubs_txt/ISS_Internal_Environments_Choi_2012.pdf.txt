In this study, fosmid cloning strategies were used to assess the microbial populations in water from the International Space
Station (ISS) drinking water system (henceforth referred to as Prebiocide and Tank A water samples). The goals of this study
were: to compare the sensitivity of the fosmid cloning strategy with that of traditional culture-based and 16S rRNA—based
approaches and to detect the widest possible spectrum of microbial populations during the water purification process.
Initially, microbes could not be cultivated, and conventional PCR failed to amplify 16S rDNA fragments from these low
biomass samples. Therefore, randomly primed rolling—circle amplification was used to amplify any DNA that might be present
in the samples, followed by size selection by using pulsed—field gel electrophoresis. The amplified high-molecular— weight
DNA from both samples was cloned into fosmid vectors. Several hundred clones were randomly selected for sequencing,
followed by BIastn/Blastx searches. Sequences encoding specific genes from Burkholderia, a species abundant in the soil and
groundwater, were found in both samples. Bradyrhizobium and Mesorhizobium, which belong to rhizobia, a large
community of nitrogen fixers often found in association with plant roots, were present in the Prebiocide samples. Ralstonia,
which is prevalent in soils with a high heavy metal content, was detected in the Tank A samples. The detection of many
unidentified sequences suggests the presence of potentially novel microbial fingerprints. The bacterial diversity detected in
this pilot study using a fosmid vector approach was higher than that detected by conventional 16S rRNA gene sequencing.
