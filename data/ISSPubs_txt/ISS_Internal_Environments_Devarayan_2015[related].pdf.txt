1n the fungl such as Ulocladzum chartarum, Pemczllzum chrysogenum, and Aspergzllus mger (A.
niger) [8, 9]. Due to the immune dysfunction in astronauts under microgravity, A. niger can
emerge as an opportunistic pathogen and cause a direct threat to the health of crew members.
The fungal growth on organic substrates is another notable problem caused by fungi. In order
to grow and multiply, fungi can utilize any organic substances, which could be the working
parts of space stations such as rubber seals of windows, component of space suits, insulations
0n cables, tubings, and other communication devices [10].

Among the fungi found in International Space Station (188), A. niger, an opportunistic path-
ogen, was predominant as a biocontaminant. It was reported that the dust sample collected
from 188 contained A. niger at higher levels than its presence in the homes in US. [10, 11].
However, the knowledge on survival and growth of fungi in response to any antifungal agents
in microgravity is limited, and the corresponding Changes to infectious diseases are also
unclear.

Generally, polycations are used as antimicrobials for clinical and domestic purposes in
recent decades. Among them, poly quaternary amines are promising as antifungal agents
[12]. Chitosan, a polycationic polymer of glucosamine, eXhibited significant antifungal
activity against several organisms including A. niger [13, 14]. A strategy to Chemically com-
bine small active molecules with Chitosan by means of alkylation, acylation, or by quaternar-
ization, can provide a synergistic effect towards its antifungal activity [15, 16]. oc-amino
phosphonates are an important group of compounds, which are structural analogs of natu-
rally-occurring amino acids present in peptides. oc-amino phosphonates were reported to act
as antiviral, antifungal, antibacterial, and in some cases antitumour agents [17—21]. In View
of enhancing the fungicidal efficacy of Chitosan, we designed a simple synthetic strategy to
synthesize a Chitosan derivative containing oc-aminophosphonate and quaternary amine
groups.

Eventhough, A. niger is being found to be a major biocontaminant in spaceships, there is to
date no report for the evaluation of the response of the A. niger against any antifungal agent
under microgravity. Thus, the present study has been undertaken with the following objectives:
(i) facile synthesis of Chitosan derivative containing oc-amino phosphonate and quaternary
ammonium group, (ii) evaluation of the fungistatic activity of the new Chitosan derivative
under microgravity, and (iii) examining the survival ofA. niger grown under both normal and
microgravity in presence of the Chitosan derivative. In order to imitate the gravity factor similar
to the space, a high aspect ratio vessel equipped with a specialized membrane was employed to
develop a low-shear modelled microgravity environment. This study would be the first to initi-
ate the examination of fungicidal potency of Chitosan derivative and ﬁrst to observe the survival
of the fungi against a fungistatic agent under microgravity.

Synthesis of N-(p-dimethylaminobenzyl) chitosan. At ﬁrst, the chitosan-Schiff base was
prepared from Chitosan and DMAB Via a reductive amination reaction. Chitosan (2.0 g) and
DMAB (1.0 eq.mol) were mixed in 30 mL of ethanol and reﬂuxed for 10 h. Then dimethyl
phosphite (1.2 eq.m01/NH2) was added dropwise to the reaction mixture and stirred for 10 h at
90°C. The reaction mixture was cooled down to 40°C and then ﬁltered. The precipitate was
washed with distilled water and ethanol and then dried under vacuum for 24 h to obtain N—(p-
dimethylaminobenzyl)-dimethyl-oc-aminophosphonate Chitosan [DMAB(P)-Ch], yellow
powder (yield: 65.1%). “P NMR (1% CD3COOD/D20, 400 MHz, 5); 8.2 ppm. FT-IR (KBr):

cm‘1 (VP_C). Elemental composition: C, 43.98%; N, 21.52%; 0, 27.14%; P, 7.37%.

Characterization of chitosan derivative. All the samples were characterized by means of
FT-IR spectroscopy (Perkin-Elmer) and UV-Visible spectroscopy (Shimadzu UV-1800, Tokyo,
Japan). 31P NMR was measured using a IEOL A-400 NMR Spectrometer. Elemental composi-
tion was performed using a IEOL ISM-5900 scanning electron microscope equipped with
energy dispersive spectrum (SEM-EDS).

Fungal strain. Aspergillus niger (A. niger) (KACC 42589) purchased from Korean Agricul-
tural Culture Collection (Suwon, South Korea). Fungal culture was maintained on potato deX-
trose agar (BD Difco, Sparks, MD) supplemented with streptomycin (100 mg/L).

Low-shear modelled microgravity. In this study, microgravity was simulated in a rotatory
cell culture system (RCCS-l) that was purchased from Synthecon, Incorporated (Houston,
Texas 77054 USA) with Autoclavable High Aspect Ratio Vessel (HARV) 0f 50 mL capacity.
Potato dextrose broth (PDB) (BD Difco, Sparks, MD) was prepared according to manufactur-
er’s instruction (2.4 g/ 100 mL). At first, HARV was filled with 49 mL of PDB with streptomycin
and 1 mL of seed culture (~106 spores/mL) was added. Then HARV was rotated in the hori-
zontal and vertical aXis at 25 rpm to obtain the microgravity and normal gravity condition,
respectively. At horizontal aXis rotation, the gravitational vectors were randomized over the
surface of the cell and thus resulting in microgravity environment with an overall-time-aver-
aged gravitational vector of 10—2 g [22]. The HARV was placed inside the humidity Chamber
with 90% humidity and maintained at 25°C to avoid formation of air bubbles that might cause
turbulence and affecting the ﬂuid dynamics during experiment due to evaporation of the
medium. The germination rates were observed for 24 h with 4 h interval time using a light
microscope (Olympus BX41TF, Tokyo, Japan). 200 spores (germinated and non-germinated)
were counted. A spore was considered to be germinated, when the length of it's germinal tube
reached one half of the diameter of the spore [23]. Experiments were performed in triplicates
and repeated. Similar to the control, experiments were performed with Ch, DMAB, and
DMAB(P)-Ch.

Radial hyphal growth bioassay. PDB was prepared as described above. Agar 1% (w/V)
and Chitosan derivative to a ﬁnal concentration of 500 pg/mL was added. The solution was
autoclaved for 15 min at 121°C and 15 psi. After cooling around 70°C the solution 20 mL was
poured into a sterile petri dish (9 cm diameter) resulting in 4 mm deep agar and allowed to
solidify. Margin of the 7 day old culture of A. niger was touched with a needle and pointwise
puncture inoculation was carried out by deposition of the inoculum t0 the center of the plate
roughly 2 mm deep and plates were incubated at 25°C. Colony diameter was measured along
the line passing through the center of the colony using a transparent ruler. An average of 5
readings was taken for the calculation. The determination of radial extension growth of the C01-
ony was measured at 2 days and 5 days and compared with the growth in control media. The

Where Cb and Ct are diameters of the fungal colony in absence and presence of Chitosan

Qualitative analysis of secondary metabolites. 10 mL of PDB with varying concentra-
tions of DMAB(P)-Ch of 500 pg/mL, 50 pg/mL, and 0 pg/mL was used for the assay. Approxi-
mately, 1 mL of stock solution(containing ~106 spores/mL) was added to each tube and
incubated at 25°C for 2 weeks. For cyclic voltammetry measurements, 1 mL of the test solution
was diluted with 74 mL of 100 mM KCl solution. The cyclic voltammetry measurements were
carried out using VersaStat4 electrochemical analyzer at the range of -0.4 to 0.9 V (vs Ag/
AgCl) at the sweep rate of 500 mV/s. The electrochemical cell consisted of a platinum wire as
counter electrode, an Ag/AgCl as the reference electrode, and a glassy carbon as working elec-
trode. Further, the samples were also analyzed by UV-Visible spectroscopy.

Scanning electron microscopy. Afte exposing t0 DMAB(P)-Ch, the fungal hyphae were
brieﬂy washed in sterile water. Primary ﬁxation of fungal hyphae was done with 2.5% glutaral-
dehyde and 2% paraformaldehyde buffered with 0.01 M phosphate buffered saline for 4 h at
4°C. Post ﬁxation was done with 1% osmium tetrOXide (Tedpella, Redding, CA) in 0.05 M PBS
pH-7.2 for 2 h. Samples brieﬂy washed with distilled water at room temperature and kept at
4°C with 0.5% uranyl acetate (EMS, Hatfield, USA). Samples were dehydrated with graded eth-
anol series 30, 40, 50, 60, 70, 80, 90% and three Changes of 100% ethanol 10 min for each alco-
hol dilution. The samples were kept in a vacuum desiccator until they were completely dry.
Samples were placed on a stub coated with carbon electron conductive tape. Sputter coated
with platinum for 120 s and examined under scanning electron microscope (IEOL ISM-5900,
Japan).

Results and Discussion

Synthesis and characterization of N-(p-dimethylaminobenzyI)-dimethyl-
a-aminophosphonate Chitosan

a-aminophosphonate derivative of Chitosan was synthesized by a catalyst-free Pudovik reac-
tion [24, 25]. At ﬁrst the Schiff base was prepared from DMAB and Ch to form DMAB-Ch.
Subsequent addition of dibutyl phosphite t0 DMAB-Ch at 90°C yielded the oc-aminophospho-
nate DMAB(P)-Ch (Fig 1). Fig 2 shows the FT-IR spectra of Ch and DMAB(P)-Ch. The broad
band from 3200 to 3500 cm’1 was attributed to the stretching Vibrations Of—OH and—NH. The
peak at 2976 and 2933 cm’1 were due to C-H asymmetric and symmetric stretching vibrations
of DMAB(P)-Ch, respectively. The amide-I and amide-II bands were observed at 1662 and
1603 cm‘l, respectively. The increase in the intensity of the amide-II band is possibly due to the
overlapped vibrations of NH+ with amide 11. Signiﬁcant peaks for the stretching vibrations of
P = O, P-C were observed at 1195 and 975 cm’l, indicated the presence of phosphonate group
in DMAB(P)-Ch.

The presence of phosphonate in DMAB(P)-Ch was further conﬁrmed by 31P NMR spec-
troscopy. The 31P NMR signal observed at 8.2 ppm in Fig 3, conﬁrms the successful synthesize
0f DMAB(P)-Ch. Fig 4 shows the UV-Visible spectra of Ch and DMAB(P)-Ch. The Ch eXhib-
ited absorption bands at 255 and 323 nm corresponding the n—>Tt* transitions. In addition
these bands, a new band at 276 nm was observed for DMAB(P)-Ch, which was attributed to
Tt—>Tt* 0f the phenyl group. Further, intermolecular Charge transfer transition observed at 412
nm indicated possible formation of quaternary ammonium structure. The elemental analysis

spores were germinated after 24 h (Fig 5A) in control. Meanwhile, 51 and 62% of spores were
germinated in the presence of Ch and DMAB, respectively. Whereas, only 21% of spores were
able to germinate in the presence of DMAB(P)-Ch. It should be noted that in control experi-
ments, spores started to germinate at 8 h. On the other hand, in presence of Ch and DMAB(P)-
Ch, germination started at 12 and 16 h, respectively. This could be due to the chelation of min-
erals, in particular Ca2+ ions or nutrients with DMAB(P)-Ch. It was reported that calcium is
one of the essential minerals for growth and spore germination [26]. The spore germination
results indicated that the modiﬁed chitisan derivative, DMAB(P)-Ch has showed signiﬁcant
synergistic effect.

After conﬁrming the inhibitory effect of DMAB(P)-Ch under normal gravity, the efﬁcacy of
the chitosan derivative was tested under microgravity. Interstingly, the spore germination pat-
tern similar to normal gravity was observed for microgravity experiments (Fig 5B). It is note-
worthy that DMAB(P)-Ch is effective under microgravity against A. niger.

Radial Hyphal Assay
The fungistatic effect of DMAB(P)-Ch under normal gravity gradually decreased with the incu-
bation time. After 2 days of inoculation, the maximal percentage of radial growth inhibition at
the concentration of 50 pg/mL was approximately 65%, and after 5 days FIE% was 19% (81 Fig
8: Table 1). However, the FIE% drastically increased to 76% and 38% for 2 days and 5 days of
incubation, respectively, with the concentration of DMAB(P)-Ch being 500 pg/mL as shown in
Table 1. Same pattern was observed in the liquid medium while measuring the fresh weight
and dry weight of the biomass grown under normal gravity conditions. Fresh weight of the
mycelium grown under normal gravity after 2 days both in the presence and absence of chito-
san derivative were 4.5 g and 2.5 g, respectively (Table 2). It is noteworthy that about 0.5 g of
fresh weight increased for mycelium grown under microgravity. This increase could be due to
the enhanced availability of nutrients in the medium to the growing fungus under weightless
environment and partially due to the gene expression changes in A. niger [8].

A. niger can adapt well to microgravity conditions without any changes in the chitin metab-
olism niger [8]. Scanning electron microscopic images revealed cell wall shrinkage due to cyto-
plasmic loss in the presence of DMAB(P)-Ch under normal gravity as well as under
microgravity, respectively. Same set of experiment was carried out in the absence of chitosan
derivative to rule out the possible artifacts inﬂuencing the A. niger morphology, and none were
observed (82A and 82B Fig). Both spores and mycelium looked healthy in the absence of chito-
san derivative under normal gravity as well as under microgravity as shown in 82A and 82B

Fig, respectively. The SEM morphological results suggested that the efﬁcacy of DMAB(P)-Ch is
not hampered under microgravity conditions.
Generally, the secondary metabolites are synthesized in the cytoplasm and released into the
growth medium. The cytoplasmic loss was validated by secondary metabolite proﬁling by UV-
Visible spectroscopy (Fig 6) and cyclic voltammetry (83 Fig). The culture filtrate was analyzed
by UV-Visible spectroscopy for qualitative screening of secondary metabolites. Normal proﬁle
of secondary metabolites was observed in the absence of chitosan derivative as seen in Fig 6.
The bands observed at 254, 280, and 415 nm may be ascertained t0 the following secondary
metabolites and mycotOXins: aurasperone D, yanuthone E, yanuthone D, nigerazine B, and
asperenone [27]. In the presence of chitosan derivative all the absorption bands were drastically
decreased, especially, the band at 415 nm corresponding to mycelial yellow colorant aspere-
none completely disappeared at 500 pg/mL of DMAB(P)-Ch. These results correlates well with

the naked-eye observation of the culture ﬁltrate as shown in the inset of Fig 6. The decreased
concentration of the secondary metabolites could be due to the cytoplasmic loss as observed in
SEM (82 Fig). The suppression of mycotOXins (allergens) by Chitosan derivative could be a sig-
niﬁcant advantage for astronauts in microgravity.

Most of the hyphae appeared to have lost their cytoplasm in the presence of DMAB(P)-Ch
(82 Fig), supporting the hypothesis of Chitosan derivative may have permeabilized through the
cell wall of A. niger associated with an increase in reactive oxygen species [28—30], eventually
causing cytoplasmic loss. Enhanced performance of DMAB(P)-Ch under microgravity may be
due to the Changes in the cell membrane electronegativity in response to the free fall condition.
Conclusions
In the present study, a new Chitosan derivative-containing oc-aminophosphonate and quater-
nary ammonium moieties were successfully synthesized by a simple catalyst-free Pudovik
reaction. The structure of the Chitosan derivative was confirmed by UV-Visible, FT-IR, 31P
NMR spectroscopies, and by elemental analysis. The fungistatic activity of the Chitosan deriv-
ative against A. niger was evaluated under normal gravity and microgravity. A linear relation-
ship was observed between the concentration of Chitosan derivative and fungal inhibition
efficiency%. Under normal gravity, Chitosan derivative eXhibited about 76% of inhibition
efficiency at the concentration 500 pg/mL for 2 days of incubation. It is noteworthy that the
Chitosan derivative inhibited about 50% 0f spore germination under microgravity. The
results obtained from UV-Visible spectroscopy and cyclic voltammetry for the culture extract
suggested that the Chitosan derivative might have altered the metabolism of A. niger for pro-
duction of secondary metabolites and mycotOXins. A possible application of the synthesized
Chitosan derivative is that it could be used as a disinfectant in space stations to remove fungal
