2 Abstract
3 In the history of manned spaceﬂight, environmental monitoring has relied heavily on archival
7
8 sampling. However, With the construction of the International Space Station (188) and the subsequent
9
10 extension in mission duration up to one year, an enhanced, real-time method for environmental
11
12 monitoring is necessary. The station air is currently monitored for trace volatile organic compounds
13
1: (VOCs) using gas chromatography-differential mobility spectrometry (GC-DMS) Via the Air Quality
1‘; Monitor (AQM), While water is analyzed to measure total organic carbon and biocide concentrations
13 using the Total Organic Carbon Analyzer (TOCA) and the Colorimetric Water Quality Monitoring Kit
20
21 (CWQMK), respectively. As mission scenarios extend beyond low earth orbit, a convergence in analytical
22
23 instrumentation to analyze both air and water samples is highly desirable. Since the AQM currently
24
25 provides quantitative, compound—speciﬁc information for air samples and many of the targets in air are
26
3:3 also common to water, this platform is a logical starting point for developing a multi-matrix monitor.
33 Here, we report on the interfacing of an electrothermal vaporization (ETV) sample introduction unit With
g; a ground-based AQM for monitoring target analytes in water. The results show that each of the
33
34 compounds tested from water have similar GC-DMS parameters as the compounds tested in air.
35
36 Moreover, the ETV enabled AQM detection of dimethlsilanediol (DMSD), a compound Whose analysis
37
38 had proven challenging using other sample introduction methods. Analysis of authentic 188 water
39
3:? samples using the ETV-AQM showed that DMSD could be successfully quantiﬁed, While the
:3 concentrations obtained for the other compounds also agreed well With laboratory results.

2 Introduction
3 Monitoring the quality of the spacecraft environment is required during human spaceﬂight to
£73 maintain the health of crew members and vehicle systems. Environmental quality accounts for
S190 contaminants found in air and water, microbial growth, acoustics, and exposure to radiation. Some maj or
1:23 atmospheric constituents (02 and C02) have been monitored in real time for decades, but the majority of
1: environmental monitoring has relied on archival sampling techniques, in Which samples are collected
1‘; from the spacecraft and returned to Earth for analysis.1 While environmental assessment from archival
13 samples has been adequate for short missions, such as those on the Space Shuttle, longer missions aboard
3(1) the International Space Station (188), in Which sample return may surpass 6 months after collection, have
3% emphasized the need for more extensive real-time environmental monitoring. This fact is especially true
2% as NASA and other space agencies move towards more distant exploration missions, When there Will be
3:3 limited ground support and no opportunity for archival sample return.
:3 The current air and water monitors on board the ISS provide very speciﬁc data. Major
3; constituents in the ISS atmosphere (02, C02, N2, H2, and CH4) are monitored by the Major Constituent
g: Analyzer (MCA), a magnetic sector mass speetrometry-based instrument.2 The Air Quality Monitor
3: (AQM) measures eompound-speeiﬁe concentrations of a targeted list of volatile organic compounds
gg (VOCs) selected based on their potential toxicological effects on crew health or detrimental effects 0n
3:? speciﬁc ISS systems?""7 The AQM combines gas chromatography With differential mobility spectrometry
jg (GC-DMS) and is the successor to the Volatile Organic Analyzer.8'10 Water quality is monitored in real
3:: time by the Total Organic Carbon Analyzer (TOCA) and the Colorimetric Water Quality Monitoring Kit
:3 (CWQMK). The TOCA measures the total organic carbon (TOC) load in the 188 water systems but does
:3 not provide eompound-speeiﬁe information. The CWQMK monitors the levels of molecular iodine in
5: water from the US. segment and ionic silver from the Russian segment. These bioeides are used to inhibit
g: microbial growth in the water and must be maintained Within a strict concentration range to prevent
g: adverse health effects such as thyroid dysfunction or argyria.11’12

2 While the TOCA provides excellent trending data regarding total organics and the overall water
3 quality on the 188, the inability to determine which compounds are responsible for any TOC increases
7
8 makes it difﬁcult to implement effective mitigation plans. If, for example, a compound with no known
9
1o adverse health effects causes a TOC increase, precious resources could be saved by not attempting to
11
12 remove it. Events beginning in June 2010 highlight the need for speciﬁc chemical information about the
13
1: presence of organic compounds in 188 water.” When the TOC began to increase in the water being
1‘; produced by the 188 Water Processor Assembly (WPA), archival samples had to be used to determine
1: which eompound(s) was responsible for the increase because there was no compound-speeiﬁc
2O
21 information available. Surprisingly, no individual organic compounds were detected at signiﬁcant levels
22
23 in the standard ground analyses. However, during testing for glycols, an interfering peak appeared.14
24
25 After signiﬁcant analytical effort, it was determined that the interfering compound was dimethylsilanediol
26
3:3 (DMSD), a degradation product of silicon-based organics, including those found in 188 air.4’6’15 DMSD
33 was found to account for greater than 90% of the TOC in the WPA product water. Despite its low to
3; moderate toxicological concern for oral exposure,16 DMSD causes other issues for 188 operations, such as
33
34 the need for early replacement of the multiﬁltration (MF) beds used to remove inorganic and non-volatile
35
36 organic contaminants.17 Replacement of the MF beds in the WPA eventually led to a decrease in the
37
38 measured TOC; however, the increase has routinely reoccurred.18 While archival analyses have shown
39
3:? that DMSD was the cause of these increases, it is risky to assume that DMSD is the only compound that
:3 typically causes an increase in TOC.
j: The use of the AQM for both air and water monitoring would provide improved information over
46
47 existing systems, while also fulﬁlling the needs of future exploration missions by reducing the amount of
48
49 hardware needed for environmental monitoring. This approach, however, necessitates an inlet system to
50
51 allow analytes in water to be volatilized before entering the AQM. A number of different techniques,
52
:2 among which are membrane extraotionlg'21 and electrospray,22'24 are available for liberating analytes from
g: a liquid matrix and promoting them to the gas phase for analysis by ion mobility spectrometry, each with
g; its own strengths and weaknesses. Membrane extraction, for example, routinely uses
59

2 polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) membranes for sampling, which can lead to recovery problems for targets
3 of interest in 188 water. Additionally, the use of membranes could lead to losses of highly water soluble
7
8 small polar organics, such as methanol, ethanol, and isopropanol. In the ease of electrospray, the use of
9
10 organic species in the solvent to promote ionization would preclude the detection of these target species.
11
12 In the present work, an electrothermal vaporization (ETV) unit recently reported by Dwivedi et
13
1: al.25 for direct analysis in real time-mass spectrometry analysis (DART-MS) is coupled to a laboratory-
1: based AQM for evaluation. The ETV releases VOCs from the water matrix, allowing them to be
13 separated by GC, ionized by a 63’Ni radioactive source, and differential-mobility-analyzed as gas-phase
2O
21 ions. The processes required for AQM calibration is described and analytical results from the ETV-AQM
22
23 are compared with standard laboratory methods for 188 archival water samples. The performance of the
24
25 ETV-AQM indicates that this platform could indeed be used for trace VOC analysis in both air and water
26
3:3 aboard the 188. The mass and volume of the system could also make it suitable as a ﬁeld deployable
33 method for water analysis in remote locations on Earth.

38 The target analytes used for this proof—of—eoneept study are a subset of those used by Dwivedi et
39
3:? al.25 These compounds are routinely found in the ISS atmosphere and are already monitored using the
:3 AQM on board the 188. The current target compounds include methanol (MeOH), ethanol (EtOH),
j: acetone (ATN), isopropanol (IPA), DMSD, trimethylsilanol (TMS), and 2-butan0ne (2BN). DMSD was
46
47 obtained from Absolute Standards, Inc. (Hamden, CT) at a concentration 0f 70 ppm. MeOH, EtOH, IPA,
48
49 and 2BN standards were > 98% purity (ChemSerViee, West Chester, PA), while TMS was 2 98% purity
50
51 (Sigma-Aldrieh, St. Louis, MO). Dilutions for testing were prepared using ultrapure water (18.2 M!) em)
52
2:43 from a Milli-Q Integral 5 water puriﬁcation system (EMD Millipore, Billerica, MA).

2 Instrumentation
g The AQM used in the current eXperiments, the technology on which it is based, and typical
7
8 methods of analysis have been described in detail previously.26’27 The AQM, built by SioneX, integrates a
9
10 preconcentrator (Carbopack B and CarbOXen 1000), a GC column (15 m X 0.25 min, bonded DB5), a
11
12 microDMX sensor, and a Windows XP computer in a 3 kg, 25.4 cm X 15.2 cm X 13.2 cm size package
13
1: with a nominal peak power demand of 72 W. The instrument is controlled by Draper EXpert software (V.
1675 4.1.3) using customized methods for sampling times and heating rates. For the results presented here, 5 s-
13 sample times were used. Scrubbing cartridges in the unit clean the recirculating carrier gas of moisture
2O
21 and VOCs using 20/54-mesh molecular sieve (HCRMS) and CarbOXen 569, respectively. An additional
22
23 scrubbing cartridge containing the same materials was used to ﬂush (purge) the pre-concentrator after
24
25 samples had been collected in order to remove eXcess moisture.
26
3:3 The ETV used for these studies is based on the design previously described by Dwivedi et al.25
33 Samples were introduced into the AQM through a short tube attached to the instrument and furnishing a
g; Swagelok-compatible ﬁtting on the other end, which was inserted into the ETV glass tube. The entire
33
34 ETV-AQM setup is shown in Figure 1A with a close-up View of the ETV in Figure 1B. Current was
35
36 supplied to the sample ribbon using a GW Instek PSM 6003 programmable power supply while clean
37
38 zero air ﬂowed through the ETV at a rate of ~ 250 cc min'l. This gas ﬂow rate was empirically
39
3:? determined to be satisfactory for the purposes of this study; however, lower ﬂow rates may also be
42
4 3 acceptable.

47 Analytical Procedure
48
49 For the tests described here, 1 ML of sample containing the target analytes was pipetted onto the
50
51 ETV nichrome ribbon prior to starting the timing sequences of both the AQM and the ETV (Supporting
52
:2 Information, Figure 8-1). After starting the ﬂow of air through the ETV, the start buttons of the AQM
g: and ETV power supply were depressed simultaneously. F ollowing 10 seconds of the AQM pump running
g; with the ETV at 0 A, the 3-way valve of the AQM opens to collect the sample VOCs for 5 seconds while
59

2
2 the current through the nichrome sample ribbon is increased to 2 A for 1 second, 5A for 2 seconds, and 6
g A for 2 seconds. At this point, the 3-way valve of the AQM closes the sample inlet and opens the purge
7
8 inlet to remove excess water from the pre-concentrator. The ETV timing sequence is repeated to clean
9
10 the ribbon between samples.
11
12 Prior to testing of all samples, both a “clean” and “n0 sample” run were performed (Tables 8-1 —
13
1: S-3). During the clean run, DI water was pipetted onto the nichrome ribbon and an ETV heating cycle
1‘; was performed. Simultaneously, the AQM pre-concentrator and GC column were heated to temperatures
1: in excess of their normal usage conditions. Each of these steps was performed in order to remove any
20
21 residual sample from the system. Subsequently, the no sample procedure (blank) occurred. In this run,
22
23 the ETV heating cycle was performed with no sample, and the AQM was set to heat the pre-concentrator
24
25 and GC column in the same manner as during a sampling session, only without the valve opening to
26
3:3 introduce a sample. The results obtained from this procedure can be used to determine the cleanliness of
33 the system prior to sample collection.

34 Results and Discussion
35
36 Compound Characterization
37
38 While GC-DMS is capable of providing compound-speciﬁc information on the composition of a
39
3:? mixture, the analytical parameters for the individual compounds (compensation ﬁeld, separation ﬁeld,
:3 retention time) must ﬁrst be ascertained. Generally, this process requires testing compounds
3:: independently. While our previous experience of calibrating the AQMs for spaceﬂight air monitoring has
46
47 provided guidance, our initial uncertainty regarding the species that would be observed for each of the
48
49 compounds selected for water analysis (monomer/dimer, hydrated clusters, etc.) required retesting of all
50
51 compounds. An ETV-GC-DMS run for a 25 ppm IPA standard is shown in Figure 2 as an example. GC
52
g: and ETV-DMS parameters obtained for all selected compounds are shown in Table 1, where all voltages
:3 have been converted to ﬁeld strength (Townsend, Td) in order to account for the temperature (~ 353 K)
g; and pressure in the DMS cell. AQM identiﬁcation of the target compounds (except for DMSD) also has
59
60 6

2
2 been conﬁrmed with mass spectral analysis.27 Note the retention times for ATN and IPA. On the
g particular GC column used for these studies, these two compounds essentially eoelute, making
E73 identiﬁcation in mixtures challenging. However, by increasing the separation ﬁeld (SF), as shown in
S190 Table 1, the two compounds can be separated in DMS space, albeit slightly, in order to allow
1:23 quantiﬁcation. This result is a consequence of a limitation of the current AQM setup; the GC column
1: only cools to approximately 308 K prior to sample runs, so many small polar organics elute in a small
1675 time window. A strength of DMS is shown in the table, however. Positive and negative ions are analyzed
13 and simultaneously detected in DMS, so a great deal of information was collected in a single run. Here,
3(1) most of the selected compounds were detected as positive ions. However, DMSD was detected much
3% more easily in the negative mode, as previously observed by Dwivedi et al.25 Potential causes for the
2% presence of DMSD in the negative mode are discussed in the Supporting Information, section 8-1.
3; During this compound characterization process, the TMS spectra showed 2 peaks, one at a
33 compensation ﬁeld (CF) of 0.11 Td (Table 1) and one at -O.21 Td, corresponding to dimer and monomer
3; species, respectively. A concentration-dependency study for this compound indicated that the dimer
:2 species provided a wider dynamic range for monitoring, while the monomer peak provided greater
33 sensitivity, as expected. Based on our previous experience with air monitoring, in which only the dimer
gg species is generally present, and the fact that the required detection limit of 0.5 mg L'1 25 was achievable
3:? using the dimer peak, further testing focused on this particular ion type.
:3 Table 2 shows the DMS parameters for these compounds selected as targets for both air and
3:: water analysis. In this table, the CF has been normalized to the applied SF in order to account for any
:3 changes in separation ﬁeld over time. It can be seen that the required normalized CFs are astonishingly
:3 similar regardless of the sample matrix, even though the results for compounds in air were obtained
5: several years prior to those in water samples. This indicates that the ionic species being detected through
:2 ETV introduction are likely the same species detected during air analysis. As the parameters for DMSD
g: in air were not previously determined using the same headspaee methods, they are not included in the
g; table.

2 It should be noted that the concentrations used for the comparison in Table 2 are quite different.
3 For instance, AQM measurements using a standard air sample are usually in the range of 0.1 — 0.9 ppm,
:3 while the water samples were all measured at 25 ppm. Previous experience has shown that air-based
S190 analysis of compounds at the levels used for the current water-based samples would saturate the detector
1:23 and, in some cases, could even saturate the sieve material used to clean the recirculation gas. However,
1: using the water samples at 25 ppm leads to peak intensities that are similar to those obtained in air at 20-
1: fold lower concentrations. There are 2 possibilities to be considered as an explanation for these intensity
1: differences. F irst, it is possible that a signiﬁcant amount of analyte is being lost during the vaporization
3(1) process. These losses might be expected, as neither the ETV itself nor the ETV-to-AQM connection are
3% airtight (Figure 1). Secondly, there is a ﬁnite mass of analyte present in the 1 ML water samples, whereas
2% an air sample will be pulled in continuously, thereby providing a greater mass of analyte being adsorbed
3:3 on the pre-concentrator, even at a much lower concentration (Supporting Information, 8-2). It is likely
33 that the latter explanation is responsible for the similar peak intensities observed for the vastly different
3; concentrations used in this testing.
:2 Data obtained using the “scanning” mode of the AQM, such as that shown in Figure 2, in which
3: the CF is swept at a constant SF, is extremely useful for characterizing individual compounds, showing
$5 the presence of unknowns, and also allowing for the detection of co-eluting compounds if their speciﬁc
3:? compensation values are sufﬁciently separated. However, in most cases, the use of a single SF will not
:3 adequately allow for the detection of all compounds. This is reﬂected in the spectra shown in Figure 3.
3:: Here, using a SF of 86 Td, a mixture containing MeOH, IPA, TMS, DMSD, and 2BN was introduced into
:3 the AQM. As can be seen in Figure 3A, for 3 of the 5 species, the peaks for the individual compounds
:3 are well separated from any other peaks in the positive mode spectrum, while DMSD is shown in the
5: negative mode spectrum (Figure 3B). However, at this SF, the MeOH peak overlaps with the reactant
:2 ion peak (RIP). The RIP signal is generally recognized as an overlapped signal consisting of a hydrated
g: proton with a variable number of water molecules attached arising from the 63’Ni ionization source.28 In
E; this case, as seen in Figure 3C, the SF must be increased in order to unambiguously separate and identify
59

2
2 MeOH. This increase in SF can lead to the loss of other compounds. Note the complete loss of IPA and
g MEK and the large decrease in intensity for TMS.
7
8 While it would certainly be possible to perform multiple experiments at different SFs in order to
9
10 acquire information on each of the compounds, this process would not be efﬁcient, especially for a non-
11
12 automated setup. The AQM also possesses a “GC” mode that allows GC retention time windows to be
13
1: correlated with eompound-speeiﬁe separation and compensation voltages determined from the scanning
1‘; mode (here, we use the term “voltage” in place of “ﬁeld” due to the fact that those are the parameters that
1: are entered into the Draper Expert software). A short GC method is displayed in Figure 4 to demonstrate
2O
21 how 6 different compounds possessing widely different separation and compensation voltages are all able
22
23 to be detected in a single experiment.
24
25
26
27 Calibration
28
33 Composite ehromatograms from each of the target compounds with increasing concentration are
3; shown in the Supporting Information, Figure 8-2. For each of the compounds, an increase in
33
34 concentration initially leads to larger peak heights, but this is also followed by a widening of the peak
35
36 itself. While initial attempts at calibration were conducted with a mixture containing siX compounds
37
38 (MeOH, EtOH, IPA, DMSD, TMS, and 2BN), it was found that the MeOH peak areas began to decrease
39
3:? at the highest concentrations tested. Based on earlier compound characterization testing at varying
:3 concentrations, this behaVior was unexpected. However, previous calibration testing with air samples in
3:: our laboratory had shown that high concentrations of large molecules, such as siloxanes, could sterically
46
47 hinder adsorption of smaller molecules on the AQM pre-eoneentrator. In that particular case, the
48
49 siloxanes were removed from the calibration mixtures and tested separately, and calibration of the smaller
50
51 molecules could then be sueeessfull com leted.7 With that in mind, new test mixtures were re ared for
52 Y P P P
:2 water testing that did not include DMSD, and the MeOH peak area with increasing concentration returned
:3 to its expected behaVior. DMSD was then prepared as a separate calibration mixture (Supporting
7 .
:8 Information, S-3).

2 For calibration, at least 3 replicates of each concentration were tested, and the average area for
g each compound and concentration calculated by the internal Draper Expert software. The data used for
E73 calibration curve construction are presented in the Supporting Information (Table 8-4). Seven replicates
S190 0f the lowest concentration standard were obtained for all compounds in order to better estimate limits of
1:23 detection (LOD; Table 8-5). The large LOD for EtOH is likely due to background EtOH in the laboratory
1: atmosphere entering the AQM during sampling.
1‘; After collection of the areas for the individual compounds, Curve Expert software (shareware
13 V.l.4) was used to prepare calibration curves. For EtOH, DMSD, and TMS, the curves, while not
3(1) perfectly linear, did not ﬂatten out at the higher concentrations used, while those for MeOH, IPA, and
3% MEK all showed saturation behavior. This ﬂattening was expected, as saturation in the source region is a
2% known complication for atmospheric pressure ion sources.29 In the current case, there is a ﬁnite reservoir
3:3 of charge in the RIP from which the analytes can become ionized.

:3 LOD, and that the value for methanol is less than 10% higher than the reporting limit of the GC-MS
g; method. The DMSD concentration reported by the ETV-AQM for the same archival sample correlated

2 very well with that from the lab techniques, with a percent error of ~ 15%. While this error may seem
3 large, when compared to the initial required accuracy for the TOCA (25%)3’0 and for volatile organic
E73 analysis in air samples by the AQM (40%),?”6 the DMSD accuracy reported here is well within the
S190 acceptable range for in-ﬂight monitoring hardware.
1:23 Analysis of a second 188 archival sample, this one being a WPA product water sample that would
1: also be expected to contain low levels of contaminants, showed similar ETV-AQM results (Table 3).18
1675 Here, all of the compounds matched with results from lab techniques insofar as the LoD would allow.
1: The ~ 29% error in the DMSD result is higher than preferable, but it is still within a range that would
3(1) provide important information regarding increases in TOC levels seen by TOCA.
3% In general, as the TOCA is focused on monitoring the product water of the US. segment and, as a
2% compound-speciﬁc analyzer would be used to complement the TOCA when TOC increases are seen, the
3:3 ability to analyze non-potable water samples (condensate or wastewater prior to processing in the WPA)
33 is not necessary. However, these types of samples can provide important information regarding the
g; ability of an analyzer such as the ETV-AQM to be used as a trending tool at high concentrations. Table
:2 8-4 in the Supporting Information presents the results of ETV-AQM analysis of 2 188 humidity
33 condensate samples. In the 188 Water Recovery System (WRS), this condensate would be combined with
$5 urine distillate from the Urine Processing Assembly (UPA) prior to feeding into the WPA. As such, these
3:? samples would be expected to have much higher concentrations of organics than the product or potable
:3 water. Results from lab techniques showed that all of the present subset of compounds are now detected
3:: and are above the minimum reporting limits for both samples. The accuracy for DMSD is very good,
:3 while the results for some of the other compounds are much less accurate. In particular, the concentrations
:3 of ethanol are so high in the archival samples that the calibration curve (which maxed out at 10 mg L'l)
5: cannot even provide an estimated concentration. The low values of MeOH and IPA could be the result of
g: preferential adsorption on the pre-concentrator by the high concentration of DMSD, whereby these
:3 compounds were not successfully trapped, as described earlier. The accuracy of TMS could likely be
g; improved by using the monomer peak for detection, while the reason for the high 2BN results is unclear.

2 As mentioned above, the majority of water quality monitoring on the 188 will continue to be
3 performed by the TOCA. Only when TOC levels begin to rise in the product water would a secondary
E73 method for monitoring be desired. At that point, the maj or question to be answered would be, “Is this
S190 increase due to DMSD?” The results shown here indicate that an ETV-AQM combination could be used
1:23 to answer that question. If testing with the ETV-AQM indicates that DMSD is not the cause of a TOC
1: increase, then a question as to the exact nature of the contaminant would arise. In this case, the AQM
1675 could identify any typical target species and provide trending data on their concentrations. The AQM
1: could also provide information (large/small, polar/non-polar, positive/negative mode) that could lead to at
3(1) least a tentative identiﬁcation of the class of compounds detected, if different from set targets. In essence,
3% the exact concentration of a particular species is not as important as knowing which species are leading to
g: a TOC increase, as the maximum TOC level for drinking water will be the same regardless of the species.

38 Conclusions
3; In order to protect the health of crew members and systems during human spaceﬂight, it is
:2 important to monitor the air and water for potential trace contaminants. Using a ground-based model of a
33 currently deployed air monitor, we successfully used ETV to promote trace volatile organic species in
$5 water into the gas phase for detection and quantiﬁcation. This technique allowed for the identiﬁcation of
3:? all of the target compounds in the tested water samples and indicated that the detected species were likely
13 in the same form as those normally monitored in air. Multi-point calibration of the instrument and
3:: analysis of archival water samples from the 188 showed that the instrument was able to quantify
:3 dimethylsilanediol, a compound of particular interest, and was able to trend other compounds in the
:3 samples. While use of this electrothermal vaporization source for testing in microgravity will require
5: additional design work that is currently underway in order to minimize the amount of crew member
:2 interaction required, it is obVious that electrothermal vaporization holds promise as a simple, laboratory-
:3 based method for analysis of volatile species in aqueous solutions with little sample preparation.
