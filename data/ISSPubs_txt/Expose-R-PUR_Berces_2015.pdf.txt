Abstract: The aim of our experiment Phage and Uracil Response was to extend the use of bacteriophage
T7 and uracil biological dosimeters for measuring the biologically effective ultraviolet (UV) dose in the harsh
extraterrestrial radiation conditions. The biological detectors were exposed in vacuum-tightly cases in the
European Space Agency (ESA) astrobiological exposure facility attached to the external platform of
Zvezda (EXPOSE-R). EXPOSE-R took off to the International Space Station (ISS) in November 2008 and
was installed on the External platform of the Russian module Zvezda of the ISS in March 2009. Our goal
was to determine the dose—effect relation for the formation of photoproducts (i.e. damage to phage DNA
and uracil, respectively). The extraterrestrial solar UV radiation ranges over the whole spectrum from
vacuum-UV (?t< 200 nm) to UVA (315 nm < 9t< 400 nm), which causes photolesions (photoproducts) in the
nucleic acids/their components either by photoionization or excitation. However, these wavelengths cause
not only photolesions but in a wavelength-dependent efﬁciency the reversion of some photolesions, too. Our
biological detectors measured in situ conditions the resultant of both reactions induced by the extraterrestrial
UV radiation. From this aspect the role of the photoreversion in the extension of the biological UV
dosimetry are discussed.
