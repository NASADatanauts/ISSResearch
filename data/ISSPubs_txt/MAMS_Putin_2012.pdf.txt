Abstract—The results of experiments with the DAKON—M convection sensor onboard the Russian orbital
segment of the International Space Station are described. A comparison of the sensor measurements with the
results of calculation of the quasistatic microacceleration component at the point of installation is made. For
this comparison we have used three measurement intervals of the experiments in 2009, during which space—
craft were docked with the station, undocked from it, and actuation of jet engines of the attitude control sys—
tem took place. When calculating microacceleration, we use the measurement data of the low—frequency
MAMS accelerometer, installed on the American segment, and the telemetry data on the [SS rotational
motion. This information allowed one to convert the MAMS measurements to the point of installation of the
DAKON—M convection sensor. A comparison of sensor measurements with calculated microaccelerations
showed sufﬁciently accurate coincidence between the calculated and measured data.
