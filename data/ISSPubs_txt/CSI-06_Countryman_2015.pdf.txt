The problem of collective search is a traoleotf between searohihg thoroughly and covering
as much area as possible. This traoleotf depends on the density of searohers. Solutions
to the problem of collective search are currently of much interest in robotics and in the
study of distributed algorithms, for example to design ways that without central control

design ways that robots can use local information to perform
search and rescue operations.
Ant colonies operate without central control, coordinating
their behavior through local interactions with each other (Gor- A 2
don, 2010). Ants perceive only local, mostly chemical and tactile rea
cues. For a colony to monitor its environment, to detect both
resources and threats, ants must move around so that if some—
thing happens, or a food source appears, some ant is likely to be
near enough to ﬁnd it. A previous study of the invasive Argentine
ant (Gordon, 1995) showed that this species manages the tradeoff A 1
for the colony, between thorough search and covering as much rea
area as possible, by adjusting ant path according to local density.
When density is high, and ants can afford to be thorough (Adler
and Gordon, 1992), ants use a more convoluted path, approach—
ing a random walk, which leads each ant to move around in a
relatively conﬁned area (Collignan et al., 2014). When density is
low, ants use straighter paths that cover more ground. It appears
that an ant assesses the local density of nestmates through its rate
of brief antennal contact with them. In the course of a brief anten— FIGURE 1 | Diagram of arena used in the experiment. The blue rectangle

Ants are an extremely diverse taxon that have evolved to func—
