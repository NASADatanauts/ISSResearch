Abstract—The urine protein composition (proteome) of healthy humans was analyzed using proteomic tech—
niques to obtain data under normal physiological conditions and after siX—month space ﬂights. It was shown
that, after long space ﬂights, speciﬁc minor proteins are revealed in cosmonauts' urine that can be identiﬁed
as proteins coming from kidneys and urinary tracts.
Keywords: urine proteome, space ﬂight, healthy humans, water—salt balance
