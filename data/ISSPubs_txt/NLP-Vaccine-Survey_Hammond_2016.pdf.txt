Virulence in adult and larval worms was evaluated by preparing C. elegans eggs just before launch. All
Group Activation Packs (GAPs) were loaded one day before launch and passed off. Eggs hatching in basal
medium are growth-arrested at the L2 stage, whereas larvae hatching in the presence of heat-killed E. coli as
