Abstract—Results of in—ﬂight tests of three modes of uncontrolled attitude motion of the Progress spacecraft
are described. These proposed modes of experiments related to microgravity are as follows: (1) triaXial gravi—
tational orientation, (2) gravitational orientation of the rotating satellite, and (3) spin—up in the plane of the orbit
around the aXis of the maximum moment of inertia. The tests were carried out from May 24 to J une l, 2004
onboard the spacecraft Progress M1 -11. The actual motion of this spacecraft with respect to its center of mass,
in the above—mentioned modes, was determined by telemetric information about an electric current tapped off
from solar batteries. The values of the current obtained during a time interval of several hours were processed
jointly using the least squares method by integration of the equations of the spacecraft’s attitude motion. The
processing resulted in estimation of the initial conditions of motion and of the parameters of mathematical mod—
els used. For the obtained motions the quasi—static component of microaccelerations was computed at a point
onboard, where installation of experimental equipment is possible.
