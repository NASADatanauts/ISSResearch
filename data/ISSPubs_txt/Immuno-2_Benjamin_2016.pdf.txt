Following the advent of molecular assays that measure T cell receptor excision circles (TRECs)
present in recent thymic emigrants, it has been conclusively shown that thymopoiesis persists
in most adults, but that functional output decreases with age, influencing the maintenance of
a diverse and functional T cell receptor (TCR) repertoire. Space flight has been shown to result
in a variety of phenotypic and functional changes in human T cells and in the reactivation of
latent viruses. While space flight has been shown to influence thymic architecture in rodents,
thymopoiesis has not previously been assessed in astronauts. Here, we assessed thymopoiesis
longitudinally over a 1-year period prior to and after long-term space flight (median duration,
184 days) in 16 astronauts. While preflight assessments of thymopoiesis remained quite stable
in individual astronauts, we detected signiﬁcant suppression of thymopoiesis in all subjects
upon return from space flight. We also found signiﬁcant increases in urine and plasma levels of
endogenous glucocorticoids coincident with the suppression of thymopoiesis. The glucocorticoid
induction and thymopoiesis suppression were transient, and they normalized shortly after return
to Earth. This is the ﬁrst report to our knowledge to prospectively demonstrate a signiﬁcant
change in thymopoiesis in healthy individuals in association with a deﬁned physiologic emotional
and physical stress event. These results suggest that suppression of thymopoiesis has the
potential to influence the maintenance of the TCR repertoire during extended space travel. Further
studies of thymopoiesis and endogenous glucocorticoids in other stress states, including illness,
are warranted.
Introduction
The thymus is responsible for production of the diverse repertoire of naive T cells that are critical for effec-
tive adaptive immunity (1—4). Naive T cells are continuously produced by the thymus and exported to the
periphery where they expand in response to homeostatic signals or antigen exposure. Maintenance of this
naive T cell receptor (T CR) repertoire is essential for control of endogenous pathogens, including latent
herpesviruses, and other opportunistic Viral and fungal pathogens. The thymus is also critical to the neo-
genesis of regulatory T cells essential for maintenance of peripheral tolerance (5—7). The diversity of the
naive T cell pool is diminished by a decrease in thymic activity and/or persistent egress of naive T cells into
the peripheral memory pool following antigenic stimulation.
T hymic involution occurs after adolescence, and, until recently, the thymus was thought to be prac-
tically vestigial in adults. Following the advent of molecular assays that measure T CR excision circles

(19—21). Stress increases the production of gluco-

in central and peripheral lymphoid compartments.
Dexamethasone has been shown in model systems to diminish the numbers of thymus-derived naive T
cells, which is followed by a rapid reseeding of the periphery after discontinuation of glucocorticoid ther-
apy (22). In Vitro, immature thymocytes have been shown to be susceptible to dexamethasone, resulting in

apoptosis and a subsequent reduction in T cells (23).

Space travel exposes astronauts to factors including microgravity, solar and cosmic radiation, and other
signiﬁcant stressors. Immune system dysregulation has been documented in astronauts during and after
space ﬂight (24—28). Space ﬂight has been shown to result in suppression of antigen-speciﬂc T cell function,
altered T cell memory subset distribution, altered cytokine production proﬁles, decreased delayed—type
hypersensitivity, and herpesvirus reactivation (29, 30). Physical and psychological stress (i.e., launch and
landing stressors, microgravity, conﬁnement, separation from family, and sleep deprivation) mediate these
changes, presumably Via activation of the hypothalamic—pituitary-adrenal aXis. Accordingly, elevated levels
of cortisol have been observed during and after spaceﬂight. Notably, glucocorticoids affect the immune
system by altering leukocyte trafﬁcking and migration as well as directly inhibiting cellular functions.

In prior studies of astronauts during short-term space shuttle ﬂight, we found that increased endog-
enous glucocorticoid levels were associated with reactivation of CMV (29); similarly, we found that CMV
reactivation occurring during glucocorticoid therapy after stem cell transplantation for graft-versus-host dis-
ease was associated with dysfunction, rather than lower numbers, of CMV—speciﬂc T cells (31). In addition
to the documented suppression of thymopoiesis and functional pathogen-speciﬂc T cells, corticosteroid
administration rapidly induces neutrophilia, with attendant relative, but not absolute, decreases in periph-
eral blood lymphocyte numbers (32).

We hypothesized that astronauts returning from long-term spaceﬂight aboard the International Space Sta-
tion (188) would be exposed to emotional and physical stress, leading to increased production of endogenous
glucocorticoids. We further hypothesized that stress-associated dysregulation of the neurologic-endocrine—
immunologic aXis would adversely affect human thymopoiesis. We tested these hypotheses in a prospective
study wherein we measured RTE within peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) of astronauts returning
from ﬂight aboard the ISS and performed parallel assessments of stress-associated glucocorticoids.

Results

T hymopoz’esz's, measured by assessment of T RECS, declines following return from Space ﬂight. Thymopoiesis
was measured at 3 time points beginning 180 days before scheduled launch by analysis of T RECs
known to be present in RTE (13). Baseline thymopoiesis varied signiﬁcantly (P < 0.001) within the
group, consistent with prior studies in healthy adults, but remained relatively stable within individuals
prior to launch (Figure l). Astronauts remained in space for variable periods, with a median dura-
tion of 184 days, and no sampling was possible during this interval. Upon return, samples were taken
within 2 to 4 hours of landing and thymopoiesis was assessed within puriﬁed mononuclear cells, given
the potential occurrence of stress-associated neutrophilia. In all 16 astronauts studied, thymopoiesis
was lower at the time of return than during any measured interval prior to ﬂight (graphical representa-
tion of original data in Figure l and T able 1 as LoglO-transformed data). Mean levels declined from a
baseline of 3,155 to 1,734 TRECs/million PBMCs (P < 0.001), corresponding to a 45% decrease in the
output of RTE from starting levels.

Following the consistent and signiﬁcantly diminished thymopoiesis observed at landing, thymic output
began a return to preﬂight levels within days to weeks of return to Earth and normalized to the preﬂight
range, remaining there through the 180-day postﬂight observation period. T hymopoiesis rebounded from

nadir at the time of return to 2,825 T RECs/ million PBMCs (P < 0.001) postﬂight, and the difference
between the baseline and postﬂight T REC levels was not signiﬁcantly different (P = 0.12) (T able 2). Results
were consistent across the entire group of ISS astronauts, and the relative decline in thymopoiesis appeared
to be independent of the baseline values. T hese results demonstrate that thymic function is altered in ISS
astronauts and suggest that T cell homeostasis may be impaired in long-duration space ﬂight.

Suppression of thymopoz'esz's is inversely correlated with a transient rise in cortisol levels. In chickens, in which
thymocyte production may be measured directly using a speciﬁc surface marker, administration of endog-
enous glucocorticoids has a profound but reversible effect on thymopoiesis (22). We sought to determine
whether alterations in endogenous glucocorticoids, known to be elevated in human stress, were similarly
associated with changes in thymopoiesis. Because plasma levels of cortisol vary diurnally, we also assessed
cortisol in a 24-hour urine collection for conﬁrmation. We found that the transient decline in thymopoi-
esis was associated temporally with a transient rise in both plasma and urinary cortisol at return to Earth
(T able 2 and graphical representation in Figure 2). In 15 0f 16 astronauts, cortisol levels were strongly and
inversely correlated to preﬂight t0 postﬂight changes in thymopoiesis (T able 2). In parallel to the signiﬁcant
declines in thymopoiesis seen at the time of return to Earth (P < 0.001), urine cortisol levels were signiﬁ-
cantly increased at return (36.2 to 73.5 ng/d; P = 0.004), with no differences between levels at baseline ver-
sus those after space ﬂight (P = 0.43). Furthermore, stress responses in long-duration ISS astronauts were
greater than those observed in shuttle astronauts spending relatively short amounts of time in space (28).
Discussion
This study is the ﬁrst investigation to our knowledge of the effects of space travel on thymopoiesis in human
astronauts. In 16 astronauts followed prospectively over a 1-year period, during which astronauts experienced
space ﬂight, we found consistent and signiﬁcant decreases in thymopoiesis in all subjects upon return from
space. Our results demonstrate that the stresses of prolonged space ﬂight result in a signiﬁcant (P < 0.001)
decrease in T cell production, with a median decrease of 45% from baseline. T 0 our knowledge, this is the ﬁrst
report to prospectively demonstrate a signiﬁcant change in thymopoiesis in any group of healthy individuals
in association with a deﬁned and consistent event characterized by profound physiologic stress.

Prior avian studies demonstrated that administration of dexamethasone reversibly suppressed thymo-
poiesis and transiently diminished thymus-derived naive T cells with rapid T cell reseeding 0f the periphery

following discontinuation of glucocorticoid therapy (22). In the present study, plasma and urinary cortisol
were highly elevated in 188 crew members (50%—200% greater than Shuttle crew members) immediately
after space ﬂight. Our results demonstrate that stress-induced increases in endogenous corticosteroids are
strongly associated with reversible suppression of thymopoiesis and conﬁrm that the thymus exhibits plas-
ticity of function in healthy individuals subjected to stress. Indeed, the kinetics of recovery were quite rapid
and consistent with timing observed in the avian model, following cessation of supraphysiologic dosing of
dexamethasone, a particularly potent glucocorticoid (22). The rapid return to baseline thymopoiesis raises
the possibility that effects on thymic export, rather than suppression of production, cannot be ruled out as
the cause of the decreases in peripheral RT E observed. While the rapid recovery of thymopoiesis observed
was surprising, prior avian studies did reveal similar kinetics following the withdrawal of exogenously
administered glucocorticoids. Future studies should examine effects of space travel on both thymic pro-
duction and export, including the role of KLFZ/SlP1 in the emigration of thymocytes as it relates to the
physiological stress of astronauts (33).

Studies have tried to explore the effect of microgravity on T cell development by utilizing micrograv-
ity organ culture systems (34). A block in T cell development was observed in mouse fetal thymus cultures
subjected to vector-averaged gravity with a clinostat (35). This block occurs between the pre—T cell and
double-positive T cell stage. Although in these systems there is an absence of stress steroids that are known
to inﬂuence thymic function, as discussed above in the avian model. Additionally, mRNA changes, as
detected by microarray, in thymus tissue taken from mice spending 13 days aboard a space shuttle dem-
onstrate that there is alteration in gene expression occurring as a result of combination microgravity and
increased stress. T hese alterations include genes that are involved in regulation of stress, glucocorticoid
receptor metabolism, and T cell signaling activity (36). More recently, there is evidence that hypergravity
has an effect on the T CRB diversity, demonstrating an 85% difference in T CRB repertoire in mice born
under increased gravitation force (37).

Our prior studies (27, 29) demonstrated that elevated catecholamines at mission return reﬂected
activation of hyp0thalamic—pituitary-adrenal and sympathetic—medullary-adrenal axes. While the mech-
anisms underlying changes of thymic output are incompletely understood, it is well known that devel-
oping thymocytes, and double-positive cells in particular, are sensitive to glucocorticoid activation of
caspases, leading to apoptosis (38). T hese results demonstrate that stress-related changes in corticoste-
roids not only inhibit mature T cell function, but also are associated with suppression of thymopoiesis,
which is essential for the maintenance of the naive T CR repertoire. Additionally, while the thymus is
known to be sensitive to radiation exposure, the astronauts in this study remained in low Earth orbit and
were not subjected to deep space radiation. Recently, NASA has implemented a radiation biodosimetry
program. Early data suggests that 188 astronauts (similar space duration of 180 days) received doses of
approximately 81 milligray equivalent, which is well below the established NASA limit of 250 milligray
equivalent per 30 days (39). Future studies will include radiation dose received.

Figure 2. Thymopoiesis, as measured by TREC analysis, and cortisol in urine and plasma are summarized for the 3 intervals (preflight, return, and
postflight). Mean preflight and mean postflight data are presented for each astronaut in black, and the mean across all 16 subjects is displayed in
red. For each endpoint, an ANOVA for single factorwith repeated measures using SAS mixed procedure, followed by pairwise means comparison with
Pvalue adjustment for multiple comparisons using Tukey’s method was performed. A 2-sided P value less than 0.05 was considered signiﬁcant.

T hese data add to a growing body of literature demonstrating immune system dysregulation in
crew members and demonstrate that suppression of thymopoiesis consistently occurs following space
ﬂight. Future studies with greater numbers of subjects and analyses of samples obtained during space
ﬂight would enhance the breadth of understanding of mechanisms contributing to the observations
presented here, including the inﬂuence of circadian effects, which are not clearly understood. The
present data, while compelling, cannot deﬁnitively establish whether suppression of thymopoiesis
occurs while in microgravity or due to physiologic stress associated with return to Earth. Our data
raise concerns that peripheral effects and central effects leading to suppression of thymopoiesis may
together signiﬁcantly increase the risk of infection during long-term space ﬂight, as would be neces-
sary for interplanetary travel. Additionally, loss of thymic function may be associated with increased
risk of autoimmunity due to increased homeostatic proliferation or loss of regulatory T cells following
lymphocyte depletion (40, 41).

We acknowledge limitations in our study, which was constrained by the unique circumstances of
space travel. Although we found consistent declines in thymopoiesis and glucocorticoid levels upon
landing, we were unable to obtain samples during space ﬂight to determine whether changes were
associated with progressive time in space and/or caused by the stress and physiologic changes associ-
ated with reentry t0 the atmosphere. Additionally, the amount of blood we could sample was limited
in this initial analysis, precluding a more detailed ﬂow cytometric analysis of phenotypic markers
of naive and memory T cells or putative surface markers of RTE. This also limited us from assess-
ing whether increases in glucocorticoid levels induced dysfunction of antigen-speciﬂc T cells, as we
previously demonstrated in CMV—speciﬂc T cells following the use of therapeutic glucocorticoids in
stem cell transplantation (31). Despite the considerable logistic limitations, these ﬁndings suggest that
expanded analyses of both in-ﬂight and return samples should be conducted in future studies inspired
by the present analysis.

Our results suggest that comprehensive health consequences for astronauts 0n exploration missions
spending signiﬁcant time in space deserve study, particularly as the control of endogenous pathogens,
including the human herpesviruses, could be impaired due to the effects of space ﬂight on the thymus.
T hese alterations are particularly remarkable since astronauts are exceptionally healthy individuals due
to the rigorous process associated with their selection for duty. It is notable that astronauts demon-
strate signiﬁcant decreases in thymic output and immune system dysregulation, despite anticipation
and exceptional training for the physical and mental stressors they will face during space ﬂight. Finally,
the restoration of thymopoiesis is indicative of the plasticity of the central lymphoid compartment in
individuals following suspension of the stress state. T hese data provide a foundation for future studies
in normal thymic function in astronauts and in the setting of acute and chronic illness.

Methods
Subjects/cells. Peripheral blood samples were collected from 16 astronauts in the morning (7—8 am) starting
at 180 days prior to launch (L—180) and continuing at deﬁned intervals until 180 days after return (R+180)
at Johnson Space Center, aside from those taken on R+0 and R+3, which were collected at Kennedy
Space Center or Star City, Russia. The precise date of sampling varied on some crew members due to
training schedules and other logistical considerations, and not every sample was collected from each sub-
ject. T here was an average of 6.8 samples taken total per astronaut (range 5—8). However, a landing day
sample was collected from all subjects (28). Sample size was limited by the number of astronauts traveling
on 188 missions during this time period. PBMCs were isolated within 1 hour of collection by density-
gradient centrifugation, frozen at less than —80°C, and held in liquid nitrogen until time of analysis. DNA
was extracted from the PBMCs and resuspended in water at 35 pl per million PBMCs lysed.

Plasma were obtained after centrifugation and stored at —70°C until testing. T wenty-four—hour urine
collections took place in parallel with every blood draw; aliquots of twenty-four—hour pools were stored at
—20 °C until analysis.

Measurement of stress hormones. The measurement of immunomodulatory hormones has been previ-
ously described (28). Urinary cortisol was measured by radioimmunoassay. Plasma cortisol was measured
using commercially available kits (Cortisol ELISA kit (cat. # ll-CORHU—EOl), Alpco Diagnostics). Sam-
ples were batch analyzed to minimize interassay variation.

ReaZ-tz'me PCR. T hymic function was assessed by ampliﬁcation and quantiﬁcation of the TCR5-deleti0r1
TRECs using a Bio-Rad QFX96 Real-Time PCR machine. Brieﬂy, DNA was ampliﬁed in 2X iQ Supermix
(with additional MgCl2 to a ﬁnal concentration of 3.5 lel), and ﬂorescent probes were used to measure
the reaction. Primers for the T REC sequence were 5’-CCCT T T CAACCAT GCT GACAC—3’ (forward) and
5’-GGGTGCAGGTGCCTATGC—3’ (reverse), which produced an 80-bp fragment that was detected with the
probe 5 ’-FAM-T CT GGT T T T T GTAAAGGT GCCCACT CCT G—BHQ—l-3’. T REC quantiﬁcation was nor-
malized for cell input by parallel quantiﬁcation of the human B—globin gene. The primers for human B—globin
were 5 ’-GAAGAGCCAAGGACAGGTACG—3’ (forward) and 5 ’-CCT GGGAGT AGAT T GGCCAA—3’
(reverse), which produced an 85-bp fragment that was detected by the probe 5 ’-FAM-CT GT CAT CACT -
T AGACCT CACCCT GT G—BHQ—l-3’. All standards were run in duplicate, and samples were run in triplicate.

Statistics. Statistical analyses were performed by the Biostatistics and Bioinformatics Core at Sylves-
ter Cancer Center. Unequal spaced repeated-measures analysis was performed for T REC values. End-
point analysis was performed on the T REC and cortisol levels in urine and plasma with an ANOVA for
single factor with repeated measures using the SAS mixed procedure, followed by pairwise means com-
parison with P value adjustment for multiple comparisons using T ukey’s method. Additionally, paired
Student’s t test was used to compare preﬂight versus postﬂight data. For all comparisons, 2-sided P
values below 0.05 were considered signiﬁcant. Analyses were conducted in SAS 9.3 and R version 15.0.

Study approval. The study protocol was approved in advance by the Committee for the Protection of
Human Subjects at Johnson Space Center and by the Institutional Review Board of The University of
T exas Medical Branch. Each subject provided written informed consent before participating.
