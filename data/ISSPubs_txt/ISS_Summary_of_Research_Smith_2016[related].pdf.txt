g Experiential education Offering “hands-on” team learning is an accepted approach for teaching engineering,
g; including undergraduate aerospace design and multi-disciplinary systems engineering. Lower-division courses
a Offering just—in-time instruction Within a design-build-test-compete framework impact retention and performance in
5 future courses [1, 2]. At the high school level, recent offerings of aircraft design-build-ﬂy competitions also show
8 positive impacts on retention and academic performance [3]. For upper division undergraduate students, aerospace
é design proj ects leading ultimately to ﬂight experiments provide multi-disciplinary systems engineering experiences
% that often also incorporate interaction With industry professionals, and consequently are effective in recruiting and

g From 2002-2007, supported in part by NASA Education’s Aerospace Workforce Development initiative, the
S University of Kentucky conducted four high-altitude ﬂight experiments to demonstrate the feasibility of high-quality
g; high-aspect-ratio inﬂatable wings for aircraft envisioned for Mars exploration (Figure 5). The Earth analog to the Mars
E atmospheric environment is at approximately 100,000 feet, so ﬂight experiments to test technologies in near-space for
5 Mars exploration have complex requirements necessitating a systems engineering approach to develop the experiment
8 design architecture which resembles in many respects that of small satellite systems.

Airplane students chose to pursue aerospace careers when such a choice was unlikely without their involvement in the
proj ect. More than 250 UK students, primarily in mechanical engineering and in electrical and computer engineering,
participated in BIG BLUE between 2002-2007 with 45 (18%) entering the aerospace workforce for companies
including Boeing, SAIC, GE Aircraft, Booz Allen Hamilton, L3, J acobs, Belcan, and others.

Throughout the ﬁve years of the BIG BLUE program, several aspects emerged as key factors in its success. First,
the project was more research-oriented than other capstone design projects, with understanding and development of
new technologies required. An introduction to the principles and practice of Systems Engineering was essential for
students to appreciate and to meet the challenge of rnulti-disciplinary design. Researchers and engineers at
organizations including NASA, NCAA, and the FAA and at numerous companies universally welcomed contacts and
provided advice, hardware and software for the proj ect. Students were regarded as peers when they called, rather than

"5","as “visitors or tourists.” The research aspect promoted a sense of importance and dedication. Realization of the
importance of their work often came with reViewer compliments at the industry/NASA design reViews, reinforced by
coverage of the proj ect by organizations including Space News, Popular Science, NASA web and others. Contributing
to a state-of-the-art endeavor proved to be an important motivating factor for students. Each year, student teams
emphasized this requirement for their selection of a capstone design proj ect to understand from the outset how spiral
design and phased development work to advance the system design and overall proj ect capability. Again, we saw that
early student leaders in the new 2006 CubeSat development efforts at UK were alums 0f the Mars Airplane near-space
research program.
IV. 2006-Present: CubeSat Development and Flight Experiments
In 2006, faculty and students at multiple universities in Kentucky began collaboration on a comprehensive
ﬂ enterprise to develop srnall-scale satellites. In three years, the Kentucky Space collaboration achieved signiﬁcant
2 accomplishments, including development of three sub-orbital payloads and launches, a CubeSat design and hardware,
g and the ﬂrst-generation ISS CubeLab standard payload with NanoRacks. Their efforts resulted in payloads ﬂying on
g the Glory mission and four Shuttle missions (STS—131, -132, -134 and -133), hence on 5 0f 9 of NASA’s major
E missions in 2010. The Glory mission was the ﬁrst NASA launch of student CubeSat secondary payloads. These
g accomplishments were achieved by a rnulti-university team of graduate/undergraduate students and mentor faculty.
(2 The team grew from 6 students in 2006-2007 to 21 in 2009-2010.
g) The Space Systems Laboratory (SSL) in the UK Electrical and Computer Engineering Department developed
'3, ste11ar gyroscope, a novel 10w-p0wer and 10w-V01urne method of attitude determination for CubeSat class systems. To
:3 test the concept, a 1U CubeSat, called KySat-2, was developed by Kentucky Space as a collaboration between UK
4% and Morehead State University (MSU). The primary mission of KySat-2 was public and educational outreach with a

a over 20 CubeSats ejected during ﬂight. Additionally, Figure 8: KySat-2 and KySat-2 Prime launch ready.
g KySat-2 holds the distinction of ﬂying the ﬁrst 3D-

4: During ﬂight, over 12,000 telemetry beacons from KySat-2 were captured and decoded by HAM radio operators
§ around the world. These were all sent to the KySat-2 teams at UK and MSU, who used this data to verify the operation
ED and health of a11 subsystems 0n the spacecraft. This included veriﬁcation of a SPA-l-based C&DH created at UK
8 (Mitchell, Rexroat, Rawashdeh, & Lumpp, 2014), an EPS created at MSU, and an in-house antenna system that
resulted in a reliable downlink. Due to successful operation, this entirely student-built spacecraft achieved mission
success and provided an excellent global outreach tool, leading to extensive collaboration with amateur HAM radio
operators, both private and at other world-renowned universities.

E In parallel to the development and 2010 launch of KySat-l, the CubeSat standard was being adapted for
ﬁg microgravity research on the Space Shuttle and the newly completed International Space Station. Several KySat
g students of the UK SSL participated in the Kentucky Space partnership with NanoRacks for the development and
C; fabrication of the ﬁrst CubeLab bus and mounting rack system for 188 microgravity experiments. After installation of
E this ﬁrst-generation rack hardware, UK students created ﬂash memory radiation susceptibility experiments to
2 demonstrate the rack's data collection and downlink capabilities. UK students also managed operation of the rack for
8 external client experiments, including a high school project to observe plant growth, a university pharmaceutical
E crystal growth experiment, and a variety of ﬂuidics experiments. Managing operations allowed these students to
f: interface with both industry and academic scientists from around the world, and work directly with NASA Marshall
(<2: Space Flight Center's ISS operations facility.
3‘
3: V. 2009-Present: ISS CubeLabs for Microgravity Experiments
E; From 2010-2014, a second—generation CubeLab bus was developed and packaged for 188 microgravity
experiments for NASA Ames Research Center's Small Spacecraft Technology Program. This program is NASA's
primary CubeSat development group, and began collaborations with the UK SSL to adapt a series of cancer research
CubeSats for operation with the CubeLab hardware on the 188 instead of free orbit. The adaptation from a nano class
spacecraft to an ISS experiment offered several advantages, such as more reliable power delivery and the possibility
for data return using existing 188 communication channels. By July 2014, several iterations of the electronics were
developed and tested, with the command and data handling (C&DH) avionics, software libraries, and the external
power supply (EPS) subsystem evolving to a mature design. Mission control software was tested and software for
mission scripting and commanding was developed and tested, allowing for adaptable and reconﬁgurable experiments.
Additionally, a space plug-and-play architecture (SPA)-1-cornp1iant “applique sensor interface module” (ASIM) has
been tested with the CubeLab Bus (Jacobs, 2013). The bus will support a wide variety of mission proﬁles after
integration with payloads. Several versions of the enclosure and connectors were tested and a ﬁnal design supporting
ﬂoating universal serial bus (USB) connectors and mounting points for payloads was designed. Thermal analysis and
testing was performed and models were produced with 3D printers and machined in aluminum.

"7","Currently, a new 188 laboratory-rack system is being developed and fabricated for delivery to the station in Early
2016. The new system is called the MultiLab, and is being developed by Kentucky Space (to be marketed by Space
Tango), with Bluegrass Embedded Design working on contract developing the embedded and electrical systems of
the hardware, as well as designing and implementing the data path from 188 to a cloud based command interface
accessible from anywhere in the world. This system will offer a variety of improvements over current small-scale
experiment facilities on the 188, including more power options, ground connectivity, and near real-time dynamic
control over payloads. The aim of the system is to provide robust and reliable services common to most payloads,
eliminating the need for individual developers to develop complex power or communications hardware, facilitating
the development of earth—connected payloads faster, cheaper, and with reduced complexity when compared with
existing 188 and small satellite platforms. The below ﬁgure shows the completed MultiLab, both in ﬂight
conﬁguration (left) and a possible experiment conﬁguration (right).

E3 The design and fabrication of the MultiLab has embraced a consumer-grade, rapid prototyping approach proven
z . . . .
5 across preV10us pI‘OJCCtS and development cycles. The des1gn leverages commer01al-0f-the-shelf (COTS) hardware
53 coupled with custom designed management systems to ensure safe and reliable operation. In addition, the design
(3; process utilized additive manufacturing techniques to quickly iterate on all structural and mechanical assemblies.
g While the ﬁnal facility will be machined from space-grade aluminum, all development hardware of the MultiLab
(é consisted of 3D printed parts. The advent of cheap additive manufacturing has revolutionized the design process for
9 such systems, with hands-on integration testing and prototyping available very cheaply compared to the cost of
:5 machining. The ﬁrst three hardware revisions were 3D printed on a Makerbot, allowing for cheap ﬁt—checks,
<2: temporary housing units and structures for circuit boards, and prototyping new designs (Mitchell, Rexroat,
4: Rawashdeh, & Lumpp, 2014)bef0re manufacture.
§
§ The electronics design implements a distributed processing approach proven 0n KySat-Z, with over 35 processing
8 elements within the MultiLab monitoring status and controlling operation. In addition, the MultiLab leverages a novel
method of tightly coupled processing pairs consisting of an extremely low powered 8-bit MCU running a custom real
time operating system throttling a 32-bit COTS single-board-computer (SBC) running an in house developed Linux
distribution. This distributed approach allows for maximum hardware and software reusability while reducing the
complexity of any individual controlling node to a single well deﬁned and tested purpose. With all circuit board design
and programming completed in-house, the custom electronics are ﬁne-tuned t0 the needs of the MultiLab facility.
VI. Local Startups and Spin Offs

"
"8","The variety of aerospace research options for students in the state of Kentucky has led to a similar variety of
companies started by many of these students. Space Tango, a spinoff from Kentucky Space, is creating and marketing
the MultiLab. The electronics design for the MultiLab is being completed by Bluegrass Embedded Design, a startup
company created by University of Kentucky computer and electrical engineering graduates in 2014. Bluegrass
Embedded Design along With Helios Aerospace is a member of Cerberus Technologies, a Lexington—based startup
that offers the full range of electrical, embedded, mechanical, and simulation services for aerospace solutions.
Bluegrass Embedded Design and Helios began their cross disciplined collaborative venture With the formation of
Mesoloft Inc, a funeral services company specializing in the distribution of cremated ashes from high altitude balloons.
This venture lead to the development of a robust and reliable HAB vehicle With dozens of successful launches and
recoveries. Cerberus Technologies is currently continuing the development of HAB avionics With the development
of a self—guided obstacle avoidance system for small payloads reentering the Earth’s atmosphere.

engineering educational aspects presented previously. While most participating students joined the aerospace
workforce at small or large companies or at national laboratories, several entrepreneurial graduates recently
established start-up companies Which are applying their educational experiences and entending the technical
results from their student experience to contribute to local economic development.
