Abstract
Current experiments aboard the International Space Station (188) illustrate an extent to Which liquid
behavior aboard spacecraft can be controlled by wetting and container geometry. The experiments are
referred to as the ‘Vane-Gap’ experiments and are part of a more general set of simple handheld Capillary
Flow Experiments” (CFE) designed and developed at NASA’s Glenn Research Center for conduct on 188.
The CFE-Vane Gap experiments highlight the sensitivity of a capillary ﬂuid surface to container shape
and how small Changes to said shape may result in dramatic global shifts of the liquid Within the container.
Understanding such behaviors is central to the passive management of liquids aboard spacecraft and in
certain cases permits us the ability to move (pump) large quantities (potentially tons) of liquid by a simple
Choice of container shape. In particular, the Vane-Gap experiments identify the critical geometric wetting
conditions of a vane structure that does not quite meet the container wall—a construct arising in various
ﬂuid systems aboard spacecraft such as liquid fuel and cryogen storage tanks, thermal ﬂuids management,
and water processing equipment. In this paper experimental results are compared With preliminary
theoretical and numerical analyses.
