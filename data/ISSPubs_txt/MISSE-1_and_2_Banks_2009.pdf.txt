Abstract
The ability to predict the atomic oxygen erosion yield of polymers based on their chemistry and
physical properties has been only partially successful because of a lack of reliable 10w Earth orbit (LEO)
erosion yield data. Unfortunately, many of the early experiments did not utilize dehydrated mass loss
measurements for erosion yield determination, and the resulting mass loss due to atomic oxygen exposure
may have been compromised because samples were often not in consistent states of dehydration during
the pre-ﬂight and post-ﬂight mass measurements. This is a particular problem for short duration mission
exposures or low erosion yield materials. However, as a result of the retrieval of the Polymer Erosion and
Contamination Experiment (PEACE) ﬂown as part of the Materials International Space Station
Experiment 2 (MISSE 2), the erosion yields of 38 polymers and pyrolytie graphite were accurately
measured. The experiment was exposed to the LEO environment for 3.95 years from August 16, 2001 to
July 30, 2005 and was successfully retrieved during a space walk on July 30, 2005 during Discovery’s
STS-114 Return to Flight mission. The 40 different materials tested (including Kapton H ﬂuenee witness
samples) were selected speciﬁcally to represent a variety of polymers used in space as well as a wide
variety of polymer chemical structures. The MISSE 2 PEACE Polymers experiment used carefully
dehydrated mass measurements, as well as accurate density measurements to obtain accurate erosion yield
data for high-ﬂuenee (8.43><1021 atoms/emz). The resulting data was used to develop an erosion yield
predictive tool with a correlation coefﬁcient of 0.895 and uncertainty of i6.3>< 10—25 em3/atom. The
predictive tool utilizes the chemical structures and physical properties of polymers to predict in-spaee
atomic oxygen erosion yields. A predictive tool concept (September 2009 version) is presented which
represents an improvement over an earlier (December 2008) version.

"6","1.0 Introduction

Early Space Shuttle ﬂight experiments found that hydrocarbon polymers exposed to the LEO
environment would gradually erode as a result of atomic oxygen exposure. The atomic oxygen interacts
with the polymers causing the surface to convert to volatile oxidation products. The atomic oxygen
erosion rates differed from one type of polymer to another (Refs. 1 to 6). This erosion susceptibility is
measured as the atomic oxygen erosion yield, which is the volume lost per incident atomic oxygen atom,
given in em3/atom (Ref. 7). Numerous LEO ﬂight experiments have been performed that have
contributed to the available data on atomic oxygen erosion yields for a variety of materials.
Many of the experiments were conducted on various short duration shuttle missions including
STS-S (Ref. 1), STS-8 (Ref. 8), and the Evaluation of Oxygen Interactions with Materials-3
(EOIM-3) experiment on STS-46 (Ref. 9). In addition, many materials were evaluated after
lengthy LEO exposure (5.8 yr) on the Long Duration Exposure Facility (LDEF) (Ref. 10).
Unfortunately, many of these early experiments did not utilize dehydrated mass loss
measurements, and the resulting mass loss due to atomic oxygen exposure may have been
obscured because samples were often not in consistent states of dehydration during the pre-ﬂight
and post-ﬂight mass measurements. This is a particular problem for short duration mission
exposures or low erosion yield materials. Inconsistent states of dehydration can cause erroneous
erosion yields because polymer mass loss due to oxidation can be indistinguishable from changes
in the amount of absorbed water in the polymer.

Forty different material samples, collectively called the Polymer Erosion and Contamination Experiment
(PEACE) Polymers, have been exposed to the LEO space environment on the exterior of the 188 for nearly
4 years as part of Materials International Space Station Experiment 2 (MISSE 2). The purpose of the MISSE
2 PEACE Polymers experiment was to accurately determine the AO erosion yield of a wide variety of
polymeric materials exposed for an extended period of time to the LEO space environment. The majority of
samples were thin ﬁlm polymers, ﬂown with numerous layers stacked together (Refs. 11 and 12). Carefully
obtained dehydrated pre-ﬂight and post-ﬂight mass measurements, as well as accurate density measurements,
were used to determine accurate high-ﬂuenoe (8.43 x1021 atoms/omz) erosion yield data for the MISSE 2
PEACE Polymers samples (Refs. 11 and 12). For many samples, multiple layers of the polymers were used
to insure that the materials would not be oxidized all the way through.

The materials chosen for the MISSE 2 PEACE experiment were selected speciﬁcally to represent
many polymers typically used in space as well as a wide variety of polymer chemical structures. The
intent of choosing a variety of polymer structures was that the diversiﬁed data could assist with the
development of an atomic oxygen erosion yield predictive tool. This tool could then be used to predict
LEO erosion yields of new polymers based on chemical structure and simple low-oost ground laboratory
test data, thus bypassing the need for actual in-spaoe LEO testing for new polymers that are developed.

As LEO erosion yield data gradually became available, it was noticed that some polymers, such as the
ﬂuoropolymers, had low erosion yields compared to polyimide Kapton H. On the other hand, those
containing signiﬁcant amounts of single bonded oxygen, such as polyoxymethylene, had higher erosion
yields than Kapton H. The dependence of atomic oxygen erosion yield on chemical structure has been
explored based on early available LEO data (Refs. 13 to 15). A variety of approaches were considered in
this paper to develop an erosion yield predictive formula based on best ﬁt criteria to the MISSE 2 PEACE
spaceﬂight data (Ref. 12).

2.0 Erosion Yield Modeling Concepts

The modeling information used to develop an atomic oxygen predictive tool consisted of the MISSE
2 PEACE Polymers LEO atomic oxygen erosion yield data (from Refs. 11 and 12), polymer Chemical
structure information concerning the number and types of chemical bonds, polymer density information
(from Refs. 11 and 12), and fractional ash content data (from Ref. 16). The atomic oxygen predictive tool
NASA/TM—2009-2 15 812 2

"
"7","was developed using these properties and assuming an unknown degree of dependence, which was tuned
to the highest correlation between actual LEO results and the predictive tool. Thus, for every physical
property or chemical bond type, a degree of dependence was assumed that was optimized to provide the
closest match between predicted and actual erosion yields. Sequential and multiple iterations were used to
gradually maximize the correlation coefﬁcient between the predicted atomic oxygen erosion yield and the
measured atomic oxygen erosion yield.

2.1 LEO Atomic Oxygen Erosion Yield Data From MISSE 2

Atomic oxygen erosion yield data was obtained from the MISSE 2 PEACE Polymers experiment,
which exposed 41 one-ineh diameter samples, including two Kapton H polyimide atomic oxygen ﬂuenee
witness samples, to the LEO space environment. This experiment was ﬂown in MISSE Passive
Experiment Container 2 (PEC 2) Tray 1, sample tray E5, which was attached to the exterior of the
International Space Station Quest Airlock, and placed in a ram facing orientation. This experiment was
subj eeted t0 directed ram atomic oxygen along with solar and charged particle radiation and was exposed
to the LEO environment for 3.95 years from August 16, 2001 to July 30, 2005. It was retrieved during a
space walk on July 30, 2005 during Discovery’s STS-114 Return to Flight mission. Figure 1 shows
MISSE 2 0n the International Space Station. Figures 2 and 3 show pre-ﬂight and post-ﬂight photos of the
MISSE 2 PEACE Polymers experiment tray containing the 40 polymers and pyrolytie graphite.

Details of the speciﬁc polymers ﬂown, ﬂight sample fabrication, solar and ionizing radiation
environmental exposure, pre-ﬂight and post-ﬂight characterization techniques, and atomic oxygen
ﬂuenee calculations are presented in References 11 and 12. The atomic oxygen ﬂuenee was found to be
8.43><1021 atoms/emz. Results of X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) contamination analysis of two
MISSE 2 sapphire witness samples in tray E6 (located on the same MISSE surface and next to tray E5)
indicated the space experiment had received very little contamination. An extremely thin silica
contaminant layer of 1.3 and 1.4 nm was on each slide, respectively (Ref. 16).

The MISSE 2 PEACE Polymers experiment LEO atomic oxygen erosion yield data, Which was used
to develop the predictive tool, is given in Table I (Refs. 11 and 12). In siX cases, the actual erosion yield is
probably greater than the value listed because a portion or all of the exposed area of the ﬂight sample was
completely eroded away. In these cases, the measured erosion yields were also included in the data set to
develop a predictive erosion yield equation because, in general, the samples appeared that they were
completely eroded at a ﬂuence level very close to the full mission ﬂuence.

2.2 Modeling Variable Considerations

Upon a cursory inspection of the atomic oxygen erosion yields from the MISSE 2 PEACE Polymers
data, as well as previous LEO ﬂight experiments, it was clear that polymers with a signiﬁcant
abundance of pendent ﬂuorine and/or chlorine atoms (such as ﬂuorinated ethylene propylene and
ehlorotriﬂuoroethylene) have low atomic oxygen erosion yields relative to Kapton H polyimide in LEO.
Conversely, polymers with signiﬁcant oxygen in their backbone (such as polyoxymethylene) had much
higher atomic oxygen erosion yields. It is far less clear as to what degree the erosion yield depends upon
mixes of in-the-ehain or pendent oxygen, nitrogen, and benzyl rings and/or whether the bonding is single,
double or triple. Thus, many approaches were explored to correlate chemical structure, the number atoms
of each type in a polymer repeat unit, and number of bonds of each type (single, double, or triple as well
as carbon bonding to what atoms) in the polymer repeat unit.

Polymer density was also considered as a potential erosion yield dependent variable because densely
packed atoms should have lower erosion yields than loosely packed atoms because it would take more
atoms to remove the same amount of volume. Data on polymer density was either obtained from supplier
information or density gradient column testing.

Most polymers contain some fraction of inorganic material that does not become volatile upon
reaction with atomic oxygen. The post-atomie oxygen exposure nonoxidizable residue is called ash. The
presence of resulting fragile remaining ash may be a portion of the debris shown on or above some of the
samples in the MISSE 2 PEACE Polymers experiment postﬂight photo shown in Figure 3. As atomic
oxygen erodes a polymer that contains inorganic material in LEO, the resulting nonvolatile ash begins to

"
"10","accumulate on the eroded surface of the polymer, tending to shield the underlying polymer from
oxidation. As a result, the ash content of polymers reduces the polymer’s erosion yield by shielding the
polymer from atomic oxygen. If one compares the erosion yield of clear polyvinyl ﬂuoride (clear Tedlar)
with that of white Tedlar, it becomes eVident that the titanium dioxide pigment particles in white Tedlar

. . . _24
higher eros1on yield, 3.19>< 10 cm3/atom, for clear Tedlar. Although the ash content expressed as a
fractional volume of ash would be more correct when considering erosion yield effects, it is much easier
to use the mass fraction of ash because the densities of the ash are difﬁcult to measure.

Ash content used to develop the predictive tool described in this paper was determined
experimentally for each of the 39 PEACE polymers (including Kapton H) and pyrolytic graphite. It was
determined as the fraction of the initial dehydrated polymer mass that is nonvolatile and remains after the
polymer has been completely oxidized in an RF plasma asher. This was accomplished by placing pieces
of each polymer in thin aluminum foil cups that were previously exposed to atomic oxygen to remove
organic coatings that typically reside on aluminum foil as a result of foil processing. The samples in the
aluminum cups were then ashed for several hundred hours in a RF plasma asher operated on air (Ref. 16)
until only ash remained. Figure 4 shows scanning electron microscope (SEM) images of the ash
remaining from white Tedlar and polyethylene oxide. Using energy dispersive spectroscopy the white
Tedlar ash indicated the presence of titanium as expected for the titanium dioxide pigment particles and
the ash from polyethylene oxide indicated a miX of metal elements.

Unfortunately, a gradual buildup of inorganic contamination from the asher itself complicates the
process of determining ash content because the added mass from contaminants is observed as additional
ash. This buildup is especially prevalent if the ashing is continued long after the organic portion of the
polymer is completely oxidized. Additionally, materials with low erosion yields in the asher environment
tend to accumulate more contamination than those with high erosion yields. The contamination is also
difﬁcult to correct for because it depends on the surface area of the ash which is difﬁcult to measure.

The effect of ash content on erosion yield in an end Hall hyperthermal atomic oxygen facility was
determined by measuring the erosion yield of ﬁve epoxy resin samples which were purposely ﬁlled with
various amounts of fumed silica. Epoxy resin with no-added fumed silica was found to also contain some
ash as indicated in Table II as a result of ashing samples of the cured epoxy. An additional amount of ash,
in the form of fumed silica, was weighed and mixed with both parts of the uncured epoxy to achieve a
total mass fraction ash indicated in Table II which was used to plot Figure 5.

Figure 5.—Erosion yield dependence on mass fraction ash in epoxy for a Kapton H effective
fluence of 1.24x1020 atoms/cmz.

The effect of the total mass fraction ash on the erosion yield was measured using an end Hall
hyperthermal atomic oxygen source operated on pure oxygen at ~70 eV. It was necessary to use
hyperthermal rather than thermal energy atomic oxygen attack because thermal energy atomic oxygen is
not greatly attenuated (compared to LEO hyperthermal atomic oxygen) in reaction probability as a result
of impingement upon ash surfaces. Because partiele-ﬁlled epoxy resins tend to have a resin rich surface
all the samples were abraded prior to atomic oxygen exposure to ensure that the surfaces exposed to
atomic oxygen were representative of the bulk material.

The results of the erosion yield dependence upon mass fraction ash for a Kapton H effective ﬂuence
of 1.24><1020 atoms/em2 is shown in Figure 5. The erosion yield of the neat epoxy resin (if there was no
ash at all in the resin) was estimated based on the slope of the curve shown in Figure 5 and the intercept at
zero mass fraction ash.

The solid line in Figure 5 is an equation which models the observed dependence given by

Ey = E0e_KA/(1_A) (1)
where
E0 Erosion yield of epoxy without any ash content in end Hall test
Ey Erosion yield of epoxy with ash content
K Erosion yield attenuation constant = 1.94 for a Kapton H effective ﬂuence of 1.24><1020 atoms/em2
A Mass fraction ash
NASA/TM—2009-2 15 812 7

"
"12","The erosion yield dependence function in Equation (1) was designed to produce an erosion yield of
zero if the ash mass fractional content is one and an erosion yield of E0 if the ash content is zero (neat
polymer). This observed erosion yield dependence on ash content was also quantiﬁably consistent With
end Hall atomic oxygen exposure of clear and White Tedlar, thus suggesting that the equation is probably
reasonably accurate for all ash containing polymers.

The solid line in Figure 6 represents the same Equation (1) erosion yield dependency constant K,
1.94, as in the Figure 5 plot.

It is expected that the erosion yield attenuation constant, K, increases With ﬂuenee for ash-eontaining
polymers as the surface of the ash containing polymers becomes more covered With remaining ash With
increasing atomic oxygen ﬂuenee. An approximation to this ash shielding dependence on ﬂuenee was
made by modeling the erosion yield of White Tedlar in hyperthermal atomic oxygen environments for the
low ﬂuenee end Hall test and the high ﬂuenee MISSE 2 LEO exposure as shown in Figure 7. In this
ﬁgure the erosion yield for the end Hall test was corrected to account for the differences between the
Kapton H effective ﬂuence of the end Hall exposure and in-spaee exposure using the ratio between
Kapton H and White Tedlar erosion yields for both environments.

Additional erosion yield dependencies were considered for the predictive model including the
physical density (in grams/om3). For example, a foam polymer would have a high erosion yield compared
to a fully dense polymer.

Also considered was the packing density of atoms, which relates to how densely the atoms
theoretically could be packed in comparison to the actual volume of the repeat unit where larger spaces
would occur between atoms due to van der Waals bonding or void spaces. Loosely packed atoms should
result in a high erosion yield compared to densely packed atoms. The minimum volume of the atoms that
make up a polymer repeat unit, V2, was based on the sum of the atoms making up the polymer repeat unit
assuming each atom’s volume is determined by its covalent radii.

The actual volume, Vr, of each repeat unit was determined based on the chemical structure of the
repeat unit as well as the molecular weight and density of the material. Thus, if the ratio of Vz/Vr was
much less than one, the polymer’s erosion yield would be higher than that of a similarly structured
polymer with tightly packed atoms. Values of VZ/Vr are given in Reference 16.

3.0 Results and Discussion

Over 100 different types of equations were tested using the information in the previous section to
determine a formula with a high correlation coefﬁcient, R2, with the actual LEO erosion yield data. An
initial erosion yield model (December 2009 version) which produced a correlation coefﬁcient of 0.914
was modeled using a linear assumption of dependency relations and made extensive use of bonding
information of the atoms in a repeat unit (Ref. 16). However, this equation was found to produce negative
erosion yields in some cases for polymers that were not ﬂown as part of the MISSE 2 PEACE Polymers
experiment.

An alternative approach (September 2009 version) was then pursued, which used the dependency
variables (such as atomic populations per repeat unit) as exponents with appropriate constants to optimize

"15","the correlation coefﬁcient. This prevented negative erosion yield values and enabled signiﬁcant
simpliﬁcation of the predictive equation With very little less in the correlation coefﬁcient.

This simpler approach resulted in a reasonably high correlation coefﬁcient With actual LEO MISSE 2
PEACE polymer data. The resulting equation used atomic populations in the repeat unit as well as
physical density, packing density, ash content, and the number of single and double oxygen bonds in the
repeat unit. The predictive LEO erosion yield equation is given by

physical properties. The values of the optimized C coefﬁcients are listed in Table IV.

"18","4.0 Summary
A predictive tool was developed to estimate the LEO atomic oxygen erosion yield of polymers based
on the results of the MISSE 2 PEACE Polymers experiment, Which accurately measured the erosion yield
of a Wide variety of polymers and pyrolytie graphite. The ﬂight experiment materials were selected
speciﬁcally to represent a variety of polymers used in space as well as a Wide variety of polymer chemical
structures. The September 2009 version predictive tool utilizes the chemical structure, atomic populations
of the polymer repeat unit, oxygen bonding information, and physical properties (such as density and

ash content) that can be measured in ground laboratory tests. The prediction does not require the use of

asher erosion yield information. The tool has a correlation coefﬁcient of 0.895 and an uncertainty of

i6.3><10_25 em3/atom When compared With actual MISSE 2 PEACE Polymers space data (for 38 polymers
and pyrolytie graphite). One polymer, polyethylene oxide (PEO), was found to be signiﬁcantly off the
linear ﬁt for some unknown reason and was not used in the predictive tool equation. The predictive tool

does appear to predict reasonable atomic oxygen erosion yields, even for those polymers that yielded a

negative erosion value With the previous predictive process. The tool also allows for the prediction of

atomic oxygen erosion yields as a function of ﬂuenee Which is relevant for polymers containing high ash

contents. The intent of the predictive tool is to be able to make estimates of LEO atomic oxygen erosion

yields for new polymers Without requiring expensive and time consumptive in-spaee testing.

14. ABSTRACT
The ability to predict the atomic oxygen erosion yield of polymers based on their chemistry and physical properties has been only partially
successful because of a lack of reliable 10w Earth orbit (LEO) erosion yield data. Unfortunately, many of the early experiments did not
utilize dehydrated mass loss measurements for erosion yield determination, and the resulting mass loss due to atomic oxygen exposure may
have been compromised because samples were often not in consistent states of dehydration during the pre-ﬂight and post-ﬂight mass
measurements. This is a particular problem for short duration mission exposures or low erosion yield materials. However, as a result of the
retrieval of the Polymer Erosion and Contamination Experiment (PEACE) ﬂown as part of the Materials International Space Station
Experiment 2 (MISSE 2), the erosion yields of 38 polymers and pyrolytic graphite were accurately measured. The experiment was exposed
to the LEO environment for 3.95 years from August 16, 2001 to July 30, 2005 and was successfully retrieved during a space walk on July
30, 2005 during Discovery’s STS-114 Return to Flight mission. The 40 different materials tested (including Kapton H ﬂuence witness
samples) were selected speciﬁcally to represent a variety of polymers used in space as well as a wide variety of polymer chemical structures.
The MISSE 2 PEACE Polymers experiment used carefully dehydrated mass measurements, as well as accurate density measurements to
obtain accurate erosion yield data for high-ﬂuence (8.43><1021 atoms/crnz). The resulting data was used to develop an erosion yield
predictive tool with a correlation coefﬁcient of 0.895 and uncertainty of i6.3><10‘25 cm3/atorn. The predictive tool utilizes the chemical
structures and physical properties of polymers to predict in-space atomic oxygen erosion yields. A predictive tool concept (September 2009
version) is presented which represents an improvement over an earlier (December 2008) version.
