41.1 Introduction

The effect of weightlessness 0n the human skeletal system is one Of the greatest concerns in safely

extending space missions [1—11]. The ability to understand and counteract weightlessness—induced

bone mineral loss will be Vital to crew health and safety during and after extended—duration space sta—

tion and exploration missions [1—7]. Research on bone mineral loss during space ﬂight has gone on

for more than half a century, and recent studies have shown signiﬁcant progress in developing coun—

termeasures that have proved to be effective, including good nutrition and exercise. We review the

history of this research here and provide a summary of recent and ongoing studies, including efforts

to counteract bone and calcium loss resulting from weightlessness.

Unfortunately, the most obvious nutritional countermeasure—providing excess calcium—does not
protect against bone loss [12]. This result is likely related to the decreased calcium absorption observed
in space ﬂight and in ground—based models [13—16]. Phosphate supplementation was also ineffective
at reducing calcium excretion [17]. Combination therapy with calcium and phosphorus was also
unsuccessful at mitigating bone loss and hypercalciuria [18]. Other nutrients, speciﬁcally sodium,
protein, potassium, Vitamin K, and omega—3 fatty acids, have also been proposed and/or tested as bone
loss countermeasures [19], and are discussed in more detail below.
41.2 Space Flight and Bone and Calcium Loss
As a result of skeletal unloading during ﬂight [20—24], bone mineral is lost, leading to increased uri—
nary excretion of calcium [21, 23, 25]. It is often estimated that the rate of bone mineral loss in the
total body during space ﬂight is about 0.5—1 % per month [26—28]. After missions of 4—6 months,
losses averaged across all skeletal sites are estimated to be 2—9 % [6], with signiﬁcant site—to—site
(Fig. 41.1) and individual variability. The bone loss and mineral shedding, including about 200—
250 mg of calcium per day [14, 15, 25, 29—31], are accompanied by an increased risk of renal stone
formation during and after ﬂight [32—36]. The effects of space ﬂight and return on bone and renal
stone risk are not different between men and women [37].

The Skylab studies showed that during space ﬂight, bone mineral was not uniformly lost from all
parts of the skeleton. Loss of bone tissue was greatest in mechanically loaded bones, but of the three
crewmembers on the 59—day Skylab 3 mission, one lost a signiﬁcant amount of os calcis bone mineral
(—7.4 %) but the other two did not (+2.3 and +1.4 %). Calcium excretion in the urine was 200 % of
the preﬂight value for the crewmember who lost os calcis mineral and 50 % of the preﬂight values for
the other two crewmembers [21]. This subject—to—subject variability remains a hallmark of space
ﬂight—induced bone loss [39], and may provide insight into ﬁnding a means to mitigate this loss.

Negative calcium balance was observed during the Skylab [21, 23, 25, 30, 40—42] and Mir [14, 15]
missions. During the 84—day Skylab 4 mission, calcium balance was —200 mg/day [25 , 29, 30], but no
signiﬁcant calcium losses occurred during the 28—day Skylab 2 mission [21, 26]. Increased urinary
and fecal calcium excretion accounts for most of the deﬁcit in calcium [14, 15, 21, 23, 25, 33, 40, 42].
During the Skylab 4 mission, calcium losses correlated roughly with bone mineral losses [43] and
increases in the excretion of hydroxyproline [29, 39]. Estimates of bone calcium loss from multiple
studies and techniques converge on the estimate of about 250 mg of bone calcium lost per day during
ﬂight [14, 15, 25 , 31]. When this rate of loss may slow down is not yet known, but it does not seem to
be within the ﬁrst 6 months of ﬂight. Studies of bone metabolism have not been possible during space
missions beyond 6 months, and the limited postﬂight bone assessment does not allow determination
of the rate of loss during ﬂight.

Bone loss and altered calcium metabolism occur in paralyzed individuals (as reViewed by Elias and
Gwinup [44]), and a number of similarities can be found between these Changes and those associated
with space ﬂight [45—48]. The loss of bone that occurs after spinal cord injury seems to stabilize after
about 25 weeks, but remains above preinjury levels for years [49, 50].

Long—term follow—up data on bone recovery are far from complete [7, 51]. However, calcium bal—
ance data indicate that the rate of recovery is about +100 mg/day [14, 15]. By these estimates, on
ﬂights up to about 6 months duration, two to three times the mission duration is needed to recover the
lost bone. Analysis of bone recovery data from dual—energy X—ray absorptiometry analyses suggests
that although regional differences occur, the half—life of bone recovery after ﬂight is on the order of
5—9 months [7, 5 2]. For longer exploration missions, however, the usefulness of these estimates comes
into question, as space ﬂight data are not available for these durations.

41.3 Space Flight and Bone Metabolism

Increased collagen cross—link excretion, and thus bone resorption, has been Clearly shown to occur
during space ﬂight [14, 15, 53—5 6]. Hydroxyproline excretion was elevated during short—duration
Shuttle ﬂights [56] and Skylab ﬂights of longer duration [25, 57, 40]. Calcium tracer kinetic studies
also provided data indicating that bone resorption increases about 50 % during ﬂight relative to before
ﬂight [14, 15]. Calcium balance studies showed calcium loss, and the initial data, along with data from
animal models, suggested that a decrease in bone formation was the source of the calcium loss while
bone resorption Changed little. The role of bone resorption was later Clariﬁed by studying mature (as
opposed to growing) animals and by examining resorption—speciﬁc markers [5 8].

Bone formation either remains unchanged or decreases during space ﬂight [14, 15, 26]. Serum
concentrations of bone—speciﬁc alkaline phosphatase and osteocalcin indicated that bone formation
was unchanged during Mir ﬂights, but increased after landing [14, 15]. Trends toward decreased leV—
els of bone formation markers were noted in two Mir case studies [54, 55]. The results of studies using
calcium tracer techniques showed bone formation in three Mir crewmembers [14, 15] to be equivocal
(formation was unchanged or decreased). Together, increased resorption and decreased or unchanged
formation yield an overall negative calcium balance [14, 15].

A potential confounding factor in early space ﬂight studies is inadequate energy intake [59].
Inadequate energy intake can have negative effects on bone, and these are exacerbated by exercise
[60, 61]. Although recent crews on the 188 have consumed Close to 90 % of estimated energy require—
ments (discussed below), Shuttle, Mir, and earlier 188 crewmembers consumed about 70 % of caloric
requirements [59].

The exact triggering mechanism for these Changes in bone metabolism during space ﬂight has yet
to be identiﬁed, but the physiological and endocrine responses to them are as expected. The release of
calcium from bone suppresses the secretion of parathyroid hormone (PTH), which results in lower
levels of activated Vitamin D (1,25—dihydroxyVitamin D), which leads to a reduction in calcium
absorption from the gastrointestinal tract. Studies of calcium metabolism were conducted on Mir, and
indeed, PTH, 1,25—dihydroxyVitamin D, and calcium absorption were all decreased [14—16].A1though
it remains important to maintain calcium intake during ﬂight, the lower calcium absorption during
ﬂight suggests that increasing calcium intake is not a Viable countermeasure for weightlessness—
induced bone loss, a fact proven in bed rest studies [62—64].

41.4 Bone Loss and Analogs of Space Flight

Space ﬂight analog studies (such as bed rest) with humans have shown qualitative effects on bone
and calcium homeostasis similar to those shown in ﬂight studies [39, 65, 66], with quantitative
effects generally being of smaller magnitude. Effects include loss of bone mass [67—70], decreased
calcium absorption [13], increased urinary excretion of calcium and biochemical markers of resorp—
tion [13, 18, 23, 70—80], increased risk of renal stone formation [76, 79, 81], and decreased serum
concentrations of PTH [71, 72, 74, 80, 82, 83] and 1,25 dihydroxyvitamin D [13, 71, 74, 83, 84].

That bone resorption increases during bed rest has been shown by histomorphometry [69, 85] and
measurement of biochemical markers. Excretion of hydroxyproline [13, 18, 77] increases during bed
rest, and excretion of collagen crosslinks [13, 53, 70—72, 80, 82, 83] is elevated about 20 % by the sec—
ond day of bed rest [86], plateauing at about 50 % above control levels after a few weeks [71, 80, 82].
The increase in cross—link excretion during space ﬂight is greater than 100 % [14, 15, 53, 54].

The concentrations of biochemical markers of bone formation are mostly unchanged during bed
rest [13, 68, 71, 72, 80, 82, 83], but histomorphometry data from bone biopsies show that bone forma—
tion decreases [69, 74, 85]. This difference likely reﬂects the difference between site—speciﬁc (biopsy)
and systemic (biochemical markers) indices of bone formation. After ambulation begins following
bed rest, bone formation generally increases [13, 68]. When data from many studies (14—90 days of
bed rest) were evaluated together, bone formation markers tended to increase over the course of bed
rest [80, 70]. Whereas in the initial publications there was no statistically signiﬁcant difference in
BSAP over time, a retrospective analysis with data from multiple studies showed a statistically signiﬁ—
cant increase in serum BSAP (Morgan et a1., in reView). We speculate that this might reﬂect the begin—
ning of a bone remodeling process, given that bone resorption does not similarly show analogous
Changes over time. Recent studies of sclerostin, an inhibitor of bone formation, have shown that it
increases during bed rest [87, 88] and in unloaded animal models [89].

41.5 Exercise

A11 crewmembers on long—duration missions are required to exercise, a combination of resistance and
aerobic exercises [90]. Exercise countermeasures have been implemented during ﬂight as far back as
the Skylab missions (Skylab was the ﬁrst vehicle to allow enough room for exercise) [91, 92]. In addi—
tion to ﬂight experiments, extensive ground—based testing has been done to evaluate the effectiveness

"
"5","41 Nutrition and Bone Health in Space 691
of exercise as a countermeasure for muscle, bone, and cardiovascular maladaptations that occur during
space ﬂight [4, 65, 93—96]. It was documented that treadmill and cycle exercise devices available on
Mir did not prevent bone and calcium loss [14, 15, 27, 97, 98]. This was largely attributed to the fact
that exercises with these devices are aerobic and not resistive types of exercise, and that treadmill run—
ning during ﬂight does not provide the same ground—reaction force that is achieved on Earth.

In 2008, the advanced resistive exercise device (ARED) was launched to the ISS. This device
accommodated additional exercise protocols, and more importantly, it had almost twice the loading
capability of the previously used device, the interim resistive exercise device [99]. Comparing crew—
members exercising with each device has been somewhat difﬁcult, given that more recent crews have
maintained energy intake at levels >90 % of estimated requirements and have had better Vitamin D
status than earlier crews. Nonetheless, these better nourished crewmembers exercising with the ARED
maintained body mass during ﬂight (and came back leaner, with less body fat), and maintained bone
mineral density in most regions and in whole—body scans, when assessed by DXA [99, 100]. When
this result was published in 2012, the number of subjects was small, in part because many crewmem—
bers participated in other countermeasure studies and were not included in this initial analysis. As
additional crewmembers have completed ﬂights they have been added into the analysis [37], and the
ﬁndings hold—well—nourished crewmembers exercising with the ARED can indeed maintain bone
mineral density after ﬂight. Another result of the increased number of crewmembers ﬂying long—
duration missions is that data are now available to document that men and women have the same
response to space ﬂight with regard to bone loss, renal stone risk, and the ability of exercise to protect
bone mineral density [37].

These data are very encouraging, but crewmembers exercising on the ARED do have alterations in
bone biochemistry (and potentially bone architecture and strength). The exercise does not simply
reverse the ﬂight—induced alterations in bone metabolism. In fact, bone resorption is still increased
above preﬂight levels, but bone formation is signiﬁcantly increased.

The bone biochemical Changes in crewmembers exercising with the ARED were very similar to
what had been observed in bed rest studies testing resistance exercise. The exercise did not affect bone
resorption, but did increase bone formation [99]. In the space ﬂight study, as published, there was only
a trend for increased bone formation ([9 <0.06) [99], whereas in bed rest, heavy resistance exercise 6
days a week led to a dramatic increase in bone formation markers [101], and in another study with
resistance exercise every other day (combined with a treadmill protocol), roughly half the bone forma—
tion response [72] seen in the ﬁrst study was obtained [101]. The exercise also did not have a signiﬁ—
cant effect on serum total calcium or urinary calcium. When data from additional crewmembers
became available, they solidiﬁed the “trend” into statistical signiﬁcance. Part of the eXplanation for
the softer response during space ﬂight than during bed rest is that the astronaut conditioning and
strength trainers were initially reluctant to have crewmembers exercise too hard with the ARED, to
minimize the risk of injury. Looking at the trend of Changes in bone formation over the course of a
6—month mission, one sees a slow, steady increase over time [99], as opposed to results from the bed
rest study, in which concentrations of bone formation markers plateaued the ﬁrst time they were deter—
mined during bed rest (after 6 weeks of bed rest) [101].

Although this mode of bone remodeling, with increases in both resorption and formation, main—
tained bone mineral density during space ﬂight, it may yield a bone with strength Characteristics dif—
ferent from those that eXisted before ﬂight. Studies to assess bone strength after ﬂight are under way
at NASA, to better understand what happens to bone under these conditions. Studies are also under—
way to evaluate optimized exercise protocols and nutritional countermeasures.

It should be noted that other physical and pharmacological countermeasures have been (and con—
tinue to be) tested in both ground—based and ﬂight studies. Replacement of graVity by centrifugation
(“artiﬁcial gravity”) has been proposed as a multi—system countermeasure [102, 103], but particularly
for bone. Although some initial studies have been completed, the optimal artiﬁcial graVity prescription
for bone, including dose, duration, and frequency of centrifugation, remains to be identiﬁed [82, 104],
along with its potential impact on nutrition and related systems [105, 106]. Vibration protocols, both

"

low and high frequency, have also been tested [107, 108], the latter serVing as much as an exercise
modality as a Vibratory stimulus [109—111].

Pharmacological agents, the most common being the bisphosphonates, have also been tested for
their ability to mitigate weightlessness—induced bone loss. Many ground analog studies of bisphos—
phonates (including bed rest studies and studies of patients immobilized because of spinal cord injury
or other reasons) have been conducted, with generally positive ﬁndings [4, 10, 69, 112—121]. Ongoing
discussion and debate surround the relative safety of these compounds for use in otherwise healthy
individuals (astronauts), as opposed to the target population for whom the drugs were developed
(most often elderly patients with disorders such as osteoporosis). In addition to resolving safety con—
cerns, investigators have yet to determine the optimal drug, dose, and schedule of administration dur—
ing space ﬂight. Nonetheless, pharmacological agents may be required on exploration—Class missions
where a full suite of exercise equipment may not be available, or for individual cases in which a
crewmember cannot exercise (for example, due to injury or illness).

41.6 Vitamin D

Vitamin D is critical for bone health and calcium metabolism, on Earth and in space. The absence of
ultraViolet light eXposure in the shielded spacecraft diminishes Vitamin D stores in astronauts, as
observed during the 84—d Skylab mission [40], Russian space station Mir missions [14, 15], and early
ISS Expeditions [122]. Despite provision of Vitamin D supplements on early ISS Expeditions (aver—
age supplement use was 30:28 tablets per week of a 400—IU Vitamin D supplement intended for
daily use), the mean serum concentration of 25—hydroxyVitamin D for the ISS crewmembers was
about 25 % less after landing than before launch [122].

In 2006, Vitamin D recommendations to crews increased from 400 IU Vitamin D/day to 800 IU
Vitamin D/day. In—ﬂight 25—hydroxyVitamin D data provide evidence that 800 IU Vitamin D/day is
enough to maintain Vitamin D status during long—duration space ﬂight (Fig. 41.2) [99]. Despite this
ﬁnding, similar to the situation for calcium, there is little evidence that maintaining Vitamin D status,
or providing excess Vitamin D, will serve as a countermeasure to the bone loss of space ﬂight.

An ideal ground—based model for individuals lacking ultraViolet light eXposure is the Antarctic,
where winter levels of ultraViolet B radiation are essentially zero. Two studies have been conducted at
McMurdo Station, Antarctica, to determine the dose of Vitamin D needed to sustain serum levels of
25—hydroxyVitamin D during a 5— to 6—month period when there is little to no ultraViolet B (UV—B)
exposure, without increasing risks of hypercalcemia [123, 124].

Several ground—based studies (performed in Antarctica and at the Johnson Space Center) support
the idea that a Vitamin D dose in the range of 800—2,000 IU/day is tolerable and safe, and can maintain
Vitamin D status for 3—6 months even in enVironments with no UV light eXposure [123—125]. This
range is in line with the recent Institute of Medicine recommendations for Vitamin D intake for North
Americans [126]. One study conducted at McMurdo Station in Antarctica showed an interactive effect
of serum cortisol and Vitamin D status on immune function [124]. In that study, subjects with higher
serum cortisol and lower Vitamin D status presented with more latent Virus reactivation in their saliva.
It is Clear that Vitamin D may have an effect on other systems besides bone, but further research is
required before eVidence—based recommendations can be made for other systems.

Throughout the 188 program, supplemental Vitamin D has been provided to astronauts to ensure
that they have optimal Vitamin D status. Efforts to provide Vitamin D supplements are misinterpreted
to infer that this might be a Viable bone loss countermeasure, but this is not the case. Even when Vita—
min D stores during ﬂight are adequate, the Circulating concentration of the active form of Vitamin D,
1,25—dihydroxyVitamin D, is decreased [14, 15]. As described in the section on calcium, this is likely
the result of the increased release of calcium from resorbed bone, and results in decreased intestinal

Fig. 41.2 Pre— and postﬂight data from medical operations required testing show that Vitamin D status of crewmembers

that 800 IU/day is enough Vitamin D3 to maintain status during long—duration space ﬂight. Red lines depict Institute of

absorption of calcium. Adequate stores of 25—hydroxyvitamin D will not affect this situation. Any
attempt to directly provide the 1,25—dihydroxyvitamin D, or as in some cases on Earth, excess
25 —hydroxyvitamin D levels, may lead to hypercalcemia, renal stones, soft tissue calciﬁcation, and at
the extreme, even death. Controlled trials in bedridden subjects have also proven that several months
of supplementation fail to affect bone metabolism. In one trial, bedridden elderly people took supple—
mental Vitamin D (400 or 1,2001U/day) or placebo for 6 months. Little effect was found on PTH, and
no effect on bone markers [127]. In a similar 40—week trial of 1,000 IU of Vitamin D2 or D3 (two
groups), neither had an effect on bone markers [62]. The problem of weightlessness—induced bone loss
must be solved, but Vitamin D is not the answer. Nevertheless, even if bone loss is not stemmed, ensur—
ing an adequate amount of Vitamin D will remain important because of its effect on other physiologi—
cal systems that are also affected by space ﬂight [124].

Toxicity of Vitamin D is typically less likely to occur than a deﬁciency [128—131], but use of
supplements increases its likelihood. Excessive blood levels of Vitamin D can lead to hypercalcemia,
which can lead to nephrocalcinosis, arteriosclerosis, and soft tissue calciﬁcation. In one study con—
ducted in Houston in healthy individuals, 50,000 IU/week for 4 weeks and then monthly increased
the incidence of urinary calcium excretion that was higher than the normal range [125]. In that study,
a 2,000—IU/day daily dose or a single 10,000—IU weekly dose did not increase the incidence of
hypercalciuria.

41.7 Iron

Changes in iron metabolism and hematology occur soon after entering weightlessness, and a hallmark
of this is a 10—15 % decrease in red blood cell mass du1ing ﬂight as a result of neocytolysis [132, 133].
One consequence of the decreased red blood cell mass is the subsequent transfer of the iron from those
cells into storage proteins and processes. Evidence of this includes increased Circulating concentrations
of serum ferritin, an indeX of iron storage, after short— and long—duration space ﬂights [122, 134, 135].

Although the in—ﬂight decrease in RBC mass is signiﬁcant, the efﬁcient postﬂight recovery suggests that
it represents a physiological (as opposed to pathological) adaptation to weightlessness. After the ﬁrst
weeks of ﬂight, RBC mass and body ﬂuid volumes reach new plateaus (lower than on Earth), as shown
by data from long—duration ﬂights [136—139].

In—ﬂight data show that iron stores increase early during a mission (within 15 days) and then return
to preﬂight concentrations by the end of a 6—month mission [140]. In a recent study with 23 crewmem—
bers on missions of 50—247—day duration, ferritin increased about 220 % in women and 70 % in men
by ﬂight day 15 [140]. At several time points, the transferrin indeX exceeded 1 pmol iron/pmol trans—
ferrin, which provides evidence for an iron overload [141]. Other acute—phase proteins (C—reactive
protein and ceruloplasmin) were not Changed during ﬂight, indicating that the ferritin response was
likely not just an inﬂammatory response. This study showed that the amount of increase in ferritin
(area under the curve) was associated with the Change in bone mineral density after ﬂight, which was
supported by the association between ferritin and other markers of iron status and markers of bone
resorption. The Change in ferritin over the course of a 6—month mission is presented below (Fig. 41.3),
and this Change was nearly identical to the Change in urinary 8—hydroxy—2’—deoxyguanosine (8OHdG,
a marker for oxidative damage) during space ﬂight. Furthermore, the greater the increase in ferritin
during ﬂight (or the longer it was elevated—either case would result in a greater area under the curve),
the greater the decrease in bone mineral density in the hip, trochanter, hip neck, and pelvis after long—
duration space ﬂight [140] (Fig. 41.4). These data are important to show that mean ferritin concentra—
tions during ﬂight that were not outside the normal Clinical range were associated with evidence of
oxidative damage and bone resorption. This association is supported by other studies in healthy
ground—based populations [142—144].

41.8 Omega-3 Fatty Acids

The body of evidence demonstrating that dietary long—Chain omega—3 polyunsaturated fatty acids,
such as eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA), have beneﬁcial effects on bone is now substantial [145—149].
The protective effect of EPA has been attributed to its anti—inﬂammatory actions and inhibition of
signaling factors, such as NF-KB, that are associated with inﬂammation and downstream activation of
the ubiquitin—proteasome system and osteoclasts [145, 150—154]. NF-KB deﬁciency in mice sup—
presses bone Changes induced by unloading [155]. In Vitro models show that EPA can inhibit

culture studies, osteoclast activation was lower when omega—3 fatty acids were added [161]. More
detailed studies are required during space ﬂight, using controlled dietary sources of omega—3 fatty
acids from the space food system or supplements, but the published data provide additional evidence
of the potential importance of ﬁsh oils as a countermeasure, not only for bone loss but also for muscle,
cardiovascular, and radiation risks of space ﬂight.
41.9 Animal ProteinzPotassium
The issue of dietary protein and bone health remains controversial despite decades of research
[162—165]. Although the literature contains evidence that seems to conﬂict, we maintain that the ratio
of dietary components (such as sulfur—containing amino acids) that lead to endogenous acid produc—
tion to components (such as potassium—rich fruits and vegetables) that lead to endogenous base pro—
duction affects acid—base balance. When the ratio is in favor of acid production, the body has a
low—level acidic load that is detrimental to bone. This concept originated with the acid—ash hypothesis
of dietary effects on acid—base balance [166] and has yielded an important area of nutrition research,
which happens to have implications for space travelers.

Dietary intake of protein, speciﬁc types of protein, and patterns of acid and base precursors have
recently been associated with the concentrations of urinary markers of bone resorption during bed rest
[19, 167, 168]. In a study of identical twins, a strong positive correlation existed between markers of
bone resorption and the ratio of animal protein to potassium intake during bed rest. The ratio of animal
protein to potassium intake was even more strongly related to bone markers at the end of bed rest,
when calcium excretion was highest. This ﬁnding supports the argument that calcium status could
have an important role in determining the effect of protein on bone. If calcium is being resorbed from
bone, then acid load can have a more detrimental effect on bone, similar to what has been observed in
other studies of the effect of high—protein diets on bone [169, 170].

This effect of protein/acid load was further documented in a study evaluating the use of supple—
mental amino acids and carbohydrate (45 g/day essential amino acids and 90 g/day sucrose) to miti—
gate muscle loss [171]. The supplement contained 1.5 g methionine, which is about 1.13 times the
recommended daily intake (supplementing the amount of methionine provided in the diet). The sulfur
in methionine is converted in the body to sulfuric acid, and thus methionine is an acid precursor in the
diet. It was evident that more methionine was broken down than was used by the body because urine

pH decreased in the amino acid—supplemented group. It was hypothesized that this low—grade meta—
bolic acidosis [172] contributed to the higher urinary concentrations of bone resorption markers and
calcium in the amino acid—supplemented group [171].

41.10 Sodium

Sodium intake of the general population in the Western world, including astronauts, is generally
rather high compared to requirements, and is one of the prominent dietary risk factors for hyperten—
sion [59, 173]. High sodium intake leads to increased urinary calcium excretion and is therefore a
well—recognized contributor to osteoporosis, particularly when calcium intake is low [174—178]. The
mechanisms causing this are not yet fully understood. Recent data documents that high sodium
intake will induce a low—grade metabolic acidosis [179—181].Acidosis is a prerequisite to osteoclast
activation [182—184].

When high sodium intake was combined with bed rest, another stimulus of increased bone resorp—
tion [86, 185], excretion of bone resorption markers had almost doubled (about 35 % increase because
of inactivity plus about 50 % increase because of high salt intake) at the end of the 2 weeks of bed rest,
relative to baseline [186].

The degree to which high sodium intake affects bone turnover during space ﬂight is currently being
examined in controlled diet studies on the ISS. Given the typical high intakes of sodium in astronauts
to date, it is very likely that bone loss can be mitigated by lowering daily sodium intake. Because of
the association of high sodium intake with bone loss and other undesirable effects in space ﬂight,
NASA has undertaken a major effort to decrease the salt content in the US space food products. The
results of this effort should be apparent in coming years.

41.11 Vitamin K

Vitamin K has been implicated in bone health because it is involved in an enzyme—catalyzed reaction
coupled to the gamma—carboxylation of the protein osteocalcin. However, its role is the subject of
continuing debate, and at present a lack of Clarity reigns [187—189]. Reports conﬂict on whether
supplemental Vitamin K has a protective effect on bone. In one study, daily Vitamin K supplementa—
tion prevented Changes in lumbar spine BMD over the course of 3 years in postmenopausal women
[190]. Other studies have shown no effect of Vitamin K supplementation on markers of bone turnover
or BMD Changes over 1— to 3—year periods [191, 192].

Initial ﬁndings from space ﬂight studies indicated that astronauts had an overall Vitamin K deﬁ—
ciency, and it was suggested that Vitamin K might serve as a Viable bone loss countermeasure. In one
study, undercarboxylated osteocalcin was elevated (a sign of Vitamin K insufﬁciency) throughout
3—week and 6—month Mir missions [185]. Data from the EuroMir 95 mission showed that markers of
Vitamin K status were decreased after 12.5 weeks of space ﬂight, and that Vitamin K supplementation
(10 mg/day for 6 weeks) reversed these effects [193]. Vitamin K supplementation elevated
y—carboxyglutamic acid and decreased undercarboxylated osteocalcin, suggesting that Vitamin K sta—
tus was lower during space ﬂight and was improved by supplementation [185 , 193]. Early data from
188 astronauts revealed that on landing day their serum phylloquinone (Vitamin K1) was 42 % lower
than it was before ﬂight, whereas urinary y—carboxyglutamic acid did not Change [122].

"
"12","698 S.M. Smith et al.
More recent data from a larger group of astronauts 0n the ISS and from several bed rest studies
showed no major Changes in phylloquinone, urinary GLA, 0r undercarboxylated osteocalcin [194].
These data indicate that although Vitamin K is an important nutrient and intake needs to meet the
body’s requirements for it, supplementation during space ﬂight is not needed, as excess Vitamin K
likely would not have an effect on bone.
41.12 Conclusion
The deleterious effects of space ﬂight on the human body are signiﬁcant. As a cross—Cutting ﬁeld, nutri—
tion holds promise for helping to mitigate these effects. N0 system has more potential for nutritional
mitigation than bone, and as highlighted brieﬂy in this Chapter, many modes of beneﬁt are possible.
Figure 41.6 shows a summary of effects of space ﬂight (and countermeasures) on bone metabolism.
Integrating these factors into the space food system and encouraging crewmembers to consume health—
ier diets has tremendous potential for future space missions in low Earth orbit and beyond. Likewise, a
better understanding of the relationship between nutrition and bone health in space can only further
enhance the understanding of this relationship on Earth, and may contribute to disease treatments for
many affected individuals and to dietary recommendations for the general population.
