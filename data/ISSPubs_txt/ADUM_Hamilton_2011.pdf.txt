Objectives: A prospective trial of echocardiography was conducted on six crew members onboard the
International Space Station. The main objective was to determine the efficacy of remotely guided te|e-
echocardiography, including just-in-time e-training methods and determine what is ”space normal”
echocardiographic data. Methods: Each crew member operator (n = 6) had 2-hour preflight training.
Baseline echocardiographic data were collected 55—167 days preflight. Similar equipment was used
in each 60-minute in-flight session (mean microgravity exposure — 114 days [34 — 190]). On-orbit
ultrasound (US) operators used an e-|earning system within 24 hours of these sessions. Expert assistance
was provided using US video downlink and two—way voice. Testing was repeated 5—16 days after
landing. Separate ANOVA was used on each echocardiographic variable (n = 33). Within each ANOVA,
three tests were made: (a) effect of mission phase (preflight, in-flight, postflight); (b) effect of echo
technician (two technicians independently analyzed the data); (c) interaction between mission phase
and technician. Results: Eleven rejections 0f the null hypothesis (mission phase or technician or both had
no effect) were found that could be considered for possible follow up. Of these, eight rejections were for
significant technician effects, not space flight. Three rejections 0f the null hypothesis (aortic valve time
velocity integral, mitral E-wave velocity, and heart rate) were attributable to space flight but determine
to not be clinically significant. N0 rejections were due to the interaction between technician and space
flight. Conclusion: Thus, we found no consistent clinically significant effects of Iong-duration space flight
on echocardiographic variables of the given group of subjects. (Echocardiography 2011;28:491-501)
