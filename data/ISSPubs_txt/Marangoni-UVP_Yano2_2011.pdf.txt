Abstract
Marangoni Experiment in Space (MEIS) has been conducted in the International Space Station (188) in order to clarify the transition
processes of thermocapillary convection in liquid bridges. The use of microgravity allows us to generate long liquid bridges, 30mm in
diameter and up to 60mm in length. Several ﬂow Visualization techniques have been applied to those large liquid bridges. 3 -D PTV is used to
reveal highly three-dimensional ﬂow patterns that appear after the transition. Three CCD cameras are used to observe the motions of the tracer
particles from different View angles through the transparent heated disk made of sapphire. Particle images are recorded in the HDD recording
system in 188 and they are downloaded to the ground for data analysis. A conventional 3-D PTV technique and a newly-developed multi-
frame particle tracking method are combined to obtain the results that can help better understanding of oscillatory 3 -D ﬂow ﬁelds in the liquid
bridges. It is shown that the ﬂow pattern changes from a 2-D axisymmetric steady ﬂow to an oscillatory 3-D non-aXisymmetric ﬂow under the
supercritical conditions.

been conducted in 2008 and 2009, respectively. In MEIS-l, the
