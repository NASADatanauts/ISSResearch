Although polyethylene glycol (PEG) is the most widely used precipitant in
protein crystallization, the concentration of c0-eXisting salt in the solution has
not been well discussed. To determine the optimum salt concentration range,
several kinds of protein were crystallized in a 30% PEG 4000 solution at various
NaCl concentrations with various pH levels. It was found that, if crystallization
occurred, the lowest effective salt concentration depended on the pH of the
protein solution and the pI of the protein molecule; that is, higher salt
concentrations were required for crystal growth if the difference between pH
and p1 was increasing. The linear relationship between the charge density of the
protein and the ionic strength of the crystallization solution was further veriﬁed.
These results suggested that the lowest effective concentration of salt in a
crystallization solution can be predicted before performing a crystallization
experiment. Our results can be a tip for tuning crystallization conditions by the
vapor-diffusion method.
