Abstract—Morphological and biochemical investigations of red blood in cosmonauts on board the International
Space Station (183) (from the 6th to the 12th expeditions) in the space experiment program “Hematology” were
carried out 30 days before the space mission (SM), at the initial (days 6—10) and fmal (days 160— 190) stages of SM,
and after the SM (immediately after SM (day 0) and on the 7th and 15th days of the adaptation period to earth con—
ditions). A reduction of the concentration ofhemoglobin after a prolonged inﬂuence of SM factors has been found,
which is probably related not only to the intensity of erythropoiesis but also with the possible early removal of a part
Oflow—quality (probably, 01d) erythrocytes from the bloodstream, which is conﬁrmed by the results on the metab—
olism of red blood cells and the state of the cell membrane. Stimulation of erythropoiesis (increase in erythropoi—
etin, decreased level of iron in blood, removal Oflow—quality and 01d erythrocytes) in the period of readaptation to
conditions on earth is aimed at maintenance of the optimal level of red blood cells required for increased oxygen
demand in tissues under the conditions of earth gravitation and enhancement of muscular load.
