ABSTRACT
The explosion 0fthc Dccpwatcr Horizon oil rig on April 20, 20|0 resulted in what is now considered
to be the largest Oil spill in US histOIy. Oil from the spill has reached the Louisiana marshes and will
continue to impact the environment. Addressing the extent and impact 0fthc Oil spill will be a focus of
study for several years. Investigations into spectral characteristics 0fthc 0i] provided by satellite-
based sensors are presented. Imagery from the MODcratc Resolution Imaging Spcctroradiomctcr
(MODIS) and Hyperspcctral lmagcr for Coastal Ocean (HICO) have been collected and processed. :
MODlS provides daily remotely sensed multispcctral data 0fthc Gulfof Mexico. HlCO is a
hyperspcctral sensor built by the Naval Research Laboratory (NRL) and currently Operating 0n the ‘
International Space Station (188). NRL is also responsible for the mission planning, targeting. and
data processing for HlCO data. Spectra from oil contaminated water and from uncontaminated water
is inspected and the ability to identify fcaturcs based on these spectra is investigated.
INTRODUCTION
‘ As Ofcarly August, 2010 it is estimated that roughly 200 million gallons ofoil has spilled into the (hllf |
ochxico from the ruptured pipes 0fthc Dccpwatcr Horizon oil rig. (NOLA Website) Remote
sensing data sets may provide a means to monitor the status 0fthc oil in thc Gulfof Mexico. Remote
sensors on satellite platforms used in this investigation provided data products for evaluation ()l‘thc
ocean. They include the MODcratc resolution Imaging Spcctroradiomctcr (MODIS) and thc
l—lypcrspcctral lmagcr for the Coastal Oceans (HICO).
REMOTE SENSING SOURCES
Moderate Ram/mimz Imaging Spectraradiometer (""z'llODlSD
The Moderate Rcsoultion Imaging Spcctmradiomctcr (MODIS) sensor has been providing remotely
sensed data over land terrain and occam for several years. A MODlS sensor exists on both the Terra
(EOS AM) and Aqua (HOS PM) NASA satellites. Terra was launched in late I999 and Aqua \\ as
launched in 2002. They are both in a sun-synchmnous orbit. However, Terra crosses the equator
traveling from north to south in the morning, while Aqua crosses the equator traveling from south to
north in the afternoon. The primary ocean color wavelengths are 412, 443, 488, 53 l , 547. 667, 678.

"5","Hyperspeetral Imagerfbr the C oastal Ocean (NICO)

The Hyperspeetra1 lmager for the Coastal Oeean (HICO) was installed on the International Space
Station (188) in September of 2009. It is designed to provide hyperspeetral imagery for the study of
the coastal ocean and adjacent land. Although the HICO sensor e011ects 128 contiguous spectral
channels of solar reﬂectance in the 350 to 1070 nmeter range, its most sensitive spectral waxl’elength I
range is from 400 to 900 nmeters. Each HICO scene is roughly 50 kmeters in width by 200 kmeters in
length. The HICO data ﬂow from the [SS provides a maximum of 15 seenes per day. Standardized
data processing is required to create timely HICO data products. HICO is managed by the Naval
Research Laboratory (NRL).

After HICO data is downlinked to ground stations, NRL processes the data through a series of
transformations. One data processing path performs atmospheric correction (SiegeL et a1.) and data
product generation on the full hyperspectral data set. Another data processing path convolves the data
over the MODIS band wavelengths to provide data products at 100 meter ground sample distance that
can be compared directly with MODIS data products. After atmospheric correction is perfonned, both
processing paths ereate standard products sueh as normalized water leaving radianees and remote
sensing reﬂectanees from the data set.

DATA COLLECTION

Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS)

MODIS data can be downloaded from the Level 1 and Atmosphere Archive and Distribution System
(LAADS) website (ladswebnaseom.nasagov/data/seareh.html). The LAADS website allows the user
to specify the sensor type. data type, date.’time, and geographic location ofdesired MODIS Level 1
data products. MODIS Level 113 data products for several dates were downloaded and inspected. The
area around the Deepwatei' Horizon location for many scenes was covered either partially or
completely by clouds. However, there were some seenes that were relatively eloud-free across the
area.

' The relatively eloud—free MODIS scenes with noticeable 0i] features are also the scenes that experience

I sun glint through the region 0fthe oil spill. Since the sun glint reﬂects differently from

I uncontaminated water and water mixed with oil, it was possible to visually identify the location ofthe

! oil in these images. Unfortunately, the sun glint also confounds the ability to extract data products
such as water leaving radianees and remote sensing reﬂectance from the data set.

1 The area 0fthe oil spill in the 05/28/10 MODIS seene was near but just outside the sun glint region.

‘ This allowed for it to both visually reveal the extent Ofthe oil spill while at the same time provide data
that could be processed to produee remote sensing reﬂectance. In addition, a HICO seene for this
same day was acquired. The MODIS scene for 05/28/10 was processed to remotely sensed reﬂectance
in preparation for comparison with data acquired from the HlCO sensor.

Before HICO was launched. NRL assembled a “target deck"" Ofdesired oeean targets scenes which has

- been updated over time. After the explosion of Deepwater Horizon a variety 0ftargets were created

explosion Site and nearby coastal environments are not always in the HICO ﬁeld Ofview. Although
there are times that the ISS orbit takes the HICO sensor out ofview 0fthc region for several days. in
general the explosion site or nearby coastal regions can be imaged by HICO about every 2 days. On
the days that the region can be imaged, usually there is only one orbit that brings the sensor close
enough for data collection. In addition, on the days that the area can be imaged, often cloud coverage
prevents a clear view 0fthe coastal region.
Although there are several factors that might prevent a HICO scene from being acquired on an ISS
I orbit, in general one 0fthc target scenes is selected for each ISS orbit. T0 perfomi this selection for
each ISS orbit, a list of potential target scenes is created by using the ISS ephemeris data and solar
positions to determine what target scenes will be visible during the ISS orbit. The scene selected for
acquisition on any given orbit is often but not always the scene from the potential scene list with the
smallest sensor zenith angle. Ifa target scene with a larger sensor zenith angle is more desirable. for
example, due to the need to create an extended time series database ofa given area or to collect data
coincident with in situ data collection mission, then the target scene with higher sensor zenith angle
will be selected as the target scene to be acquired for that particular ISS orbit. Commands are sent
through NASA to the 188 and the HICO sensor to schedule the selected target scenes for acquisition.
The initial collection ofHICO target scenes for investigating the oil spill included areas around the
Deepwatcr Horizon explosion site. Additional tiles were added to cover marshlands and barrier islands
in southern Louisiana and Mississippi. Targets were selected for acquisition based not only on the
sensor ?cnith angle for each target scene, but also on the collection frequency ofpreviously acquired
targets. Figure I shows the ascending and descending HICO Oil Spill tiles targets. In some cases the
locations were adjusted slightly and the label updated to provide a more descriptive name than simply
a sequential number.

with phytoplankton and other minerals in the water within the cell size ofone MODIS pixel. The
spatial resolution of HICO is 100 meters, which lends itselfto more detailed spatial discrimination of
the data. Although each HICO data set shown in Table i was processed. some scenes were obscured
by Cloud cover and not all the scenes contained Clearly diseemabie 0i] phenomenon.
Figure 521 shows a subset ot‘the 05/28/10 scene containing the oil phenomenon. A mask was created to
cut out the clouds that were adjacent to the areas of water and mixture of oil and water. The area
covered in Figure 5 is located between the Deepwater Horizon explosion site and the mouth ot'the
Mississippi River. Fingers Ofemulsiﬁed oil can be see extending horizontally across the image.
Smaller localized concentrations of emulsified oil can also be seen in the center of the image. Figure
Sb shows the same image with the regions of interest created over the uncontaminated water depicted
in green, the regions of interest created over oil and water mixture locations depicted in orange. and the .

The Hl(‘(i) data was processed to remote sensing reﬂectance. The mean ()fthe remote sensing
reﬂectance spectra drawn from the water. oil.-'water and emulsified oil regions of interest were
computed and are shown in Figure 6. The spectra for the water feature is higher than the spectra from
the oil features through the visible bands with the greatest difference being in the 443 nmeter hand.
Then it intersects the spectra for the emulsiﬁed oil feature near the 500 nmeter wavelength and also
intersects the spectra for the oilfwater mixture feature near the 525 nmeter wavelength.
