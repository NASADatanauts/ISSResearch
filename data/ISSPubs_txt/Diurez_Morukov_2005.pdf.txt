Abstract—Parameters of calcium homeostasis and its hormonal regulation, including biochemical markers of
bone metabolism, were measured in the blood serum of Russian cosmonauts after prolonged ﬂights on the Inter—
national Space Station during the period from 2000 to 2003. The duration of the spaceﬂights was 129—196 days.
Flight factors had an impact on calcium and bone tissue metabolism after a ﬂight. Increased levels of osteogen—
esis and resorption markers were detected in the blood of the cosmonauts in the early rehabilitation period after
a spaceﬂight. The prevalence of resorption over the formation of new bone tissue was Observed in the early reha—
bilitation period, when the hormonal system maintaining calcium homeostasis was activated.

1'5 (b) observed after a ﬂight [14, 15]. A common manifesta-
tion of a negative calcium balance is increased calcium
[ excretion by the kidneys as a result of decreased cal-
cium reabsorption in the renal tubules [14]. A negative
calcium balance between the body and its environment
is also related to its decreased absorption in the gas-
trointestinal tract because of the effect of microgravity.
1.0 This effect was observed in tests performed on the
orbital station Mir and during the ﬂight of Skylab
[4, 16]. The level of intestinal calcium absorption was
lower and calcium excretion Via the intestine was
higher even after the end of prolonged spaceﬂights.
After landing, two or three months were not enough for
renal and intestinal calcium excretion to reach normal
0 5 values [4].

An analysis of the calcium loss by the body in asso-
ciation with a study of hormonal regulation in Russian
cosmonauts after ﬂights of 150—237 days on the orbital
station M ir revealed a relationship between the activity
of mineralotropic hormones and the extent of the cal-
cium loss [17]. An increase in the PTH level (some-
times by a factor of 2) seemed to facilitate mobilization
