Abstract This paper describes the prediction of mass evaporation of Fe50C050 at%
alloys during thermophysical property measurements using the electrostatic levitator
at NASA Marshall Space Flight Center in Huntsville, AL. The ﬁnal mass, ﬁnal compo—
sition, and activity of individual component are considered in the calculation of mass
evaporation. The predicted reduction in mass and variation in composition are vali—
dated With six ESL samples Which underwent different thermal cycles. The predicted
mass evaporation and composition shift show good agreement With experiments With
the maximum relative errors of 4.8 % and 1.7 %, respectively.

1 Introduction

In recent decades, containerless processing has played an important role in the mea—
surement of thermophysical properties of molten metals. One prominent advantage
of containerless processing is that it allows accessing a much Wider range of process
parameters by removing containers. Density [1—5], Viscosity [6—8], surface tension
[6,8—11], and thermal expansion [12,13] have been the properties of interest for a

number of research groups. In general, these properties are measured using either
electromagnetic levitation (EML) 0r electrostatic levitation (ESL) techniques.

In EML, a spherical sample of 5 mm to 7 mm in diameter is levitated and heated
simultaneously by an electromagnetic force and eddy currents generated by a set of
upper and lower copper coils [14,15]. The temperature of the sample is controlled by
adjusting the input power to the coils and by ﬂowing Ar 0r He gas over the sample. A
high—speed camera captures the proj ected shape of the sample, Which is to be analyzed
by an appropriate image processing technique to obtain the density and Viscosity. One
drawback of the ground—based EML is that the combination of the electromagnetic
ﬁeld and gravity deforms the EML sample, and it often gives rise to difﬁculties in
the process of image analysis. Since the EML sample is processed at atmospheric
pressure, mass evaporation is typically negligible.

ESL deals with smaller samples of 1 mm to 2 mm in diameter. It uses an electrostatic
ﬁeld formed between a pair of vertical electrodes to levitate the sample Which has been
Charged With electrons on its surface. The stability of the sample in the transverse
direction is secured by two orthogonal pairs of electrodes aligned on a horizontal
plane [10,14,16]. After levitation and stabilization, a laser heats the sample. As in the
case of EML, a high—speed camera is used to capture the images of the sample. Since
there is a large difference in the electric Charge between vertical electrodes, the test
must be performed in a vacuum Chamber (~10‘7 torr) in order to prevent arcs between
electrodes [10]. Processing in vacuum increases the rate of mass evaporation. In this
case, a reasonable prediction of the variation in mass is of major importance, as the
error in the mass prediction should propagate into the density and Viscosity With the
same orders of magnitude. This research describes the methodology of the estimation
of mass evaporation during thermophysical property measurements of siX Fe50C050
samples. A set of experiments is also conducted to verify the analytical estimation of
mass evaporation.

2 Mass Evaporation of ESL Sample

2.1 Thermal Cycle

Figurel shows a typical melting cycle and the calculated mass loss of a sample
processed in ESL. A solid sample is heated to its melting point Where the temper—
ature is constant until the sample melts completely. And then the molten sample is
heated above its melting temperature. After reaching the desired superheating tem—
perature, the heating laser is turned off and the sample cools down freely even down
to its melting point. The undercooled sample suddenly releases heat and begins to
solidify and then it becomes a solid. The Change in mass is almost negligible at low
temperatures and suddenly becomes noticeable at temperatures higher than ~90 % of
its melting point in K, Where most measurements occur.

2.2 Mass Evaporation of a Pure Substance

The rate of mass evaporation of a pure substance can be calculated using Langmuir’s
equation [17],

is the correction factor Which indicates the degree of deviation in the rate of mass
evaporation compared to an ideal evaporation in vacuum; thus, one can expect the
correction factor to be near unity in ESL tests Where the process is done in a vacuum
Chamber. In general, the correction factor is determined by an iterative manner such
that the difference between the predicted and actual ﬁnal mass is to be minimized.
2.3 Mass Evaporation of Alloys
Three more factors should be considered when dealing With mass evaporation of
alloys, Which are the activity of individual components, surface segregation, and the
ﬁnal composition. First, the activities of individual species must be introduced in Eq. 1.
The activity is deﬁned as the ratio of the fugacity 0f the substance at temperature T to its
fugacity in its standard state [18]. Given that the vapor pressure and molecular weight
of the components are comparable to one another, a component With higher activity
is more vulnerable to mass evaporation. The activities of iron and cobalt in Fe50C050
at different temperatures are calculated using a commercial thermodynamic software
Thermo—CalcTM, and the data are ﬁtted With second—order polynomials (R2 = 0.989
for cobalt, 0.999 for iron) to obtain the activities as a function of temperature as shown
in Fig. 2. The plot reveals that the activity is not the same as the concentration and
varies With temperature, Which implies it is the activity and not the concentration that

Fig. 2 Activities of Fe and C0 in Fe50C050 alloy

expressed as

«271 Ml- RT
Where Al- is the molar surface area of component i . The total mass loss at a speciﬁc
time in a thermal cycle can be estimated by integrating Eq. 3 With respect to time for
individual components and summing them up.

Second, the surface segregation resulting from the difference in surface tension of
the different alloy components at a given temperature should affect the mass evapo—
ration. If the difference in surface tension of components is large, a component With
the smaller surface tension segregates 0n the surface of the molten sample and evapo—
rates more. In such a case, a diffusion effect of the component(s) With higher surface
tension through that With lower surface tension must be also considered, Which makes
the analysis much more complicated. The combination of a large difference in surface
tension and low diffusion would result in the evaporation of only the components With
higher surface tension. In the case of iron—cobalt alloys, iron and cobalt have very
similar physical properties as shown in Tab1e1 [19]. Differences in surface tension
and their temperature dependence are almost negligible, Which implies that it is very
likely that the surface concentration of iron—cobalt alloys is the same as the bulk con—

For iron—cobalt alloys, it can be reasonably assumed that iron and cobalt share the

surface area according to their compositions and the diffusion effect does not have to

be considered in the course of analysis.

Third, differences in the activity, surface tension, and vapor pressure can give rise
to the variation in the composition of alloys during the process of mass evaporation. In
our experiments, it is observed that the mole fraction of iron increases up to 0.57 at%
to 2.21 at% depending on the thermal history of the samples. The ﬁnal composition is
to be used as a constraint in the prediction of mass evaporation.

2.4 Estimation of Mass Evaporation
The vapor pressure of iron and cobalt as a function of temperature is plotted in Fig. 3
based on the data taken from [21]. At high temperatures, the vapor pressure of iron is
larger by a factor of 2 t0 5, Which means iron evaporates more than cobalt for Fe50C050.
Now all terms in Eq. 3 are known except for the correction factor. The correction factor
is set as unity for the reason mentioned in the previous section. The total loss of mass
due to mass evaporation at a speciﬁc time 7 during a melting cycle can be estimated

3 Experiments
3.1 Sample Preparation
Mass evaporation during Viscosity measurements is predicted in this research. SiX
Fe50C050 samples were fabricated. 4 N iron and 3.5 N cobalt wires were cut and ﬁled
to match the desired composition and then were arC—melted to form alloys. The amount
of mass evaporation during arC—melting was about ~0.09 % 0f the mass before are—
melting; therefore, the variation in composition by the arC—melting was assumed to be
negligible. After arc—melting, the mass of the samples was measured.
3.2 Thermal Cycle during Viscosity Measurement
The ESL facility at the NASA Marshall Space Flight Center was used for this research.
After the sample was loaded in the vacuum Chamber (~10‘7 t0rr), it was levitated and
stabilized by three pairs of orthogonal electrodes. Heating was achieved by a 200W
Nd:YAG laser which can melt tungsten. Each sample was subjected to a different
thermal cycle based on the requirements of Viscosity tests. For isothermal Viscosity
measurements, the power of the laser was controlled such that the temperature of
the sample was sustained at the desired thermal hold temperature. An example of
the thermal history is shown in Fig. 4. The thermal h01dtemperature of this sample is
1830.15 K which corresponds to ~80 K above the melting temperature. The maximum

amount of superheating for the tested samples was set under 100K above which the
sample could be destabilized by losing the electrons charged on its surface. It was
noticed that the rate of mass evaporation increased abruptly upon melting and showed
almost a constant value during isothermal hold. The details of thermal cycles of the
samples are listed in Table 2. After the measurement was done, the tested samples
were weighed and sent to Lubak Inc., Boylston, MA for their elemental analysis.
4 Results and Discussion
The mass loss of the samples is predicted as a function of time for the corresponding
thermal cycles using Eq. 4, and the predicted mass loss and composition shift are
tabulated with the measured values in Table 2. The measured mass loss varies from
3.8 % (Sample 1,70 s at Tm —|— 20 K) to 9.2 % (Sample 5, 85 s at Tm —|— 80 K) depending
on the thermal cycles. As can be predicted, a combination of higher temperature
and longer duration tends to result in more mass evaporation. The relative errors in
the prediction of the evaporated mass and composition are within 4.8 % and 1.8 %,
respectively. Considering the uncertainties in the vapor pressure and activity data, it can
be stated that there is excellent agreement between the predicted and measured mass
loss and composition shift. The correlation between the amount of mass evaporation
and the errors in the predicted ﬁnal mass/composition is not statistically signiﬁcant
(R2 ~ 0.11 and 0.52, respectively). The implications of this work are that for small
sample sizes such as utilized during ESL, Changes in sample dimension and mass must
be tracked in order to ensure accurate thermophysical property evaluations such as for
density, thermal expansion, Viscosity, or surface tension.
5 Conclusions and Future Work
Through this research the following conclusions can be made:

1. The variation in mass and composition of Fe50C050 samples during ESL Viscosity
measurement is estimated using Langmuir’s equation of evaporation with consid—
eration of the activity and surface segregation.

2. The predicted mass evaporation and composition shift with a correction factor of
1.0 show good agreement with the measured values with maximum relative errors
of 4.8 % and 1.7 %, respectively.

3. The correlation between the amount of mass evaporation and errors in the predic—
tion of evaporated mass and composition shift is statistically insigniﬁcant with R2
values of 0.11 and 0.52, respectively.

As future work, this method will be applied to different compositions and systems.

In order to have deeper insight on the relationship between the temperature and the

correction factor, more experiments at various thermal conditions will be conducted.

Additional efforts would be needed to predict the evaporation of alloy systems with a

large surface tension difference such as Ti—Al.
