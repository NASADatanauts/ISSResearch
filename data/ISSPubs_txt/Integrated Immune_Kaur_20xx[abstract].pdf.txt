Neutrophil and monocyte functions (phagocytosis, oxidative burst, degranulation) and
expression of surface markers involved in these functions were studied in 25 astronauts before
and after 4 space shuttle missions lasting from 5 to 11 days. Blood specimens were obtained 10
days before launch, 3 hours after landing, and again at 3 days after landing. Blood samples were
also collected from 9 healthy low-stressed subjects at 3 time points simulating a 10-day shuttle
mission. The number of neutrophils increased at landing by 85% when compared to the preﬂight
numbers whereas there were varied changes in the number of monocytes. Phagocytosis of E.
coli and oxidative burst capacity of the neutrophils and monocytes following the 9 to 11 day
missions were lower at all three sampling points compared to control subj ects. Mission duration
appears to be a factor in phagocytie and oxidative functions. Monocytes 0f the astronauts 0f the
5-day mission were unable degranulate as well as the controls whereas no alterations in
degranulation were observed for the neutrophils. The expression of CD16, CD32, CD1 1a,
CD1 1b, CD110, L-seleetin and CD36 was measured and found to be variable. We can conclude
from this study that the stresses associated with space ﬂight can alter the important functions of
neutrophils and monocytes.
