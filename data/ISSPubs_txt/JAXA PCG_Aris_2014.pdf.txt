Three-dimensional structure of thermostable lipase is much sought after nowadays as it is important for industrial application
mainly found in the food, detergent, and pharmaceutical sectors. Crystallization utilizing the counter diffusion method in space
was performed with the aim to obtain high resolution diffracting crystals with better internal order to improve the accuracy of the
structure. Thermostable T11ipase enzyme has been crystallized in laboratory on earth and also under microgravity condition aboard
Progress spacecraft to the 188 in collaboration with IAXA (Japanese Aerospace Exploration Agency). This study is conducted with
the aims of improving crystal packing and structure resolution. The diffraction data set for ground grown crystal was collected to
1.3 A resolution and belonged to monoclinic C2 space group with unit cell parameters a = 117.40 A, b = 80.95 A, and c = 99.81 A,
whereas the diffraction data set for space grown crystal was collected to 1.1A resolution and belonged to monoclinic C2 space group
with unit cell parameters a = 117.31 A, b = 80.85 A, and c = 99.81 A. The maj or difference between the two crystal growth systems
is the lack of convection and sedimentation in microgravity environment resulted in the growth of much higher quality crystals of
T11ipase.
