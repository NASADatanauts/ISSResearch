1. Abstract
How cells manage without gravity and how they change in the absence of gravity
are basic questions that only prolonged life on a Space station will enable us to answer.
We know from investigations carried out on various kinds of Space vehicles and
stations that profound physiological effects can and often do occur. We need to know
more of the basic biochemistry and biophysics both of cells and of whole organisms
in conditions of reduced gravity. The unique environment of Space affords plant
scientists an unusual opportunity to carry out experiments in microgravity, but some
major challenges must be faced before this can be done with confidence. Various
laboratory activities that are routine on Earth take on special significance and offer
problems that need imaginative resolution before even a relatively simple experiment
can be reliably executed on a Space station. For example, scientists might wish to
investigate whether adaptive or other changes that have occurred in the environment
of Space are retained after return to Earth-normal conditions. Investigators seeking to
carry out experiments in the low-gravity environment of Space using cultured cells will
need to solve the problem of keeping cultures quiescent for protracted periods before
an experiment is initiated, after periodic sampling is carried out, and after the experi-
ment is completed. This review gives an evaluation of a range of strategies that can
enable one to manipulate cell physiology and curtail growth dramatically toward this
end. These strategies include cryopreservation, chilling, reduced oxygen, gel entrap-
ment strategies, osmotic adjustment, nutrient starvation, pH manipulation, and the use
of mitotic inhibitors and growth-retarding chemicals. Cells not only need to be ren-
dered quiescent for protracted periods but they also must be recoverable and further
grown if it is so desired. Elaboration of satisfactory procedures for management of
cells and tissues at “near zero or minimal growth” will have great value and practical
consequences for experimentation on Earth as well as in Space. All of the parameters
and conditions and procedural details needed to meet all the specific objectives will be
the basis of the design and fabrication of cell culture units for use in the Space
environment. It is expected that this will be an evolutionary process.

11. Introduction to the Problem
Publication of a review typically reﬂects that a topic has matured enough to merit an
evaluation of its status and has a sufﬁcient base to allow analysis and integration of
published findings. Ideally, models for future research are developed. The topic under-
taken here, however, is far from mature. Moreover, it might appear at ﬁrst glance so
specialized as to attract the interest of perhaps only a few. After all, any kind of Space
biology investigation could seem as if it represents an unusual, even esoteric, activity, far
removed from mainstream research concerns. But although the number of investigations
carried out on plants in the Space environment is not large, it is not negligible (Halstead
& Dutcher, 1987; Halstead & Scott, 1990; Halstead et a1., 1991; Merkys & Laurinaviéius,

1991; Nechitailo & Mashinsky, 1993; Schaeffer et al., 1993; Dutcher et al., 1994, and
references cited therein). And there is considerable optimism that this area, perhaps better
viewed under the umbrella designation of “gravitational and Space biology,” will in the
future attract an increasing number of investigators who will take advantage of the unique
environmental conditions for experimentation that Space offers.

A. SPECIAL FEATURES OF THE SPACE ENVIRONMENT

First and foremost, the Space environment [even the environment of low Earth orbit
(LEO) at 120 to 450 nautical miles—223.3 to 833.4 km—above Earth’s surface] is free
of gravitational inﬂuences, free of tidal forces and the cyclical events of celestial
mechanics, and free of the Earth’s magnetic fields. Life on Earth has evolved, of course,
under the influence of each of these and perhaps other fields of force which are as yet
unknown or unappreciated (see Nechitailo & Mashinsky, 1993; Markert & Krikorian,
1993, and references cited therein). While there has been some work on the effects of the
absence or presence of magnetic fields and the quality and quantity of electromagnetic
radiation on plants, Earth-based biological studies have generally been limited to in-
creases in the field above Earth-normal gravity (1-G), i.e., hypergravity (Gray & Edwards,
1971; Kelly & Smith, 1974; Nakazawa, 1989; Brown, 1992, 1996).

In orbit, centrifugal force balances the gravitational force so that the mass of a satellite
or Space vehicle is often thought of as existing in a state of “apparent zero gravity.” The
term “microgravity” (u-G) has been used to reflect more precisely the small levels of G
that generally exist even in free-fall orbit. Even light exerts pressure. For example, the
amount of pressure imposed by sunlight on a spacecraft is on the order of 1 x 10'9 G (e.g.,
see Krikorian & Levine, 1991: 494; Nechitailo & Mashinsky, 1993: 96). Simulation of
the near—weightlessness of Space cannot be accurately simulated on Earth. Until recently,
attempts to compensate for or to neutralize asymmetry or the G vector, by appropriate
rotation of organisms on horizontal or even 3-D clinostats, so as to “null” or “time-aver-
age” the G force were seen as experimental approximations of “zero G” (Larsen, 1962;
Hoshizaki, 1973; Smith, 1974, 1975; Gruener, 1985; Smith et al., 1992). But this view is
increasingly being discredited, since on clinostats there may be vibrational stress and thus
an increase in stirring and convection at the cellular level rather than a lowering or
elimination, as would, in theory, occur in weightlessness (Silver, 1976; Albrecht-Buehler,
1991, 1992; Kessler, 1992).

Indeed, in the near-weightless environment of Space (here weightlessness is defined
as 10'6 to 10'4 G), there are no convective currents due to G, there is no buoyancy, and
surface tension dominates. Moreover, with respect to experiments in Space involving a
fluid phase—namely, water in all biological systems—although the laws of classical
physics such as momentum and mass conservation, energy conservation, and Maxwell’s
equations still apply, the relative importance of the G force to other forces changes
(Ostrach, 1982; Netter & Weiss, 1992; Polezhaev & Ermakov, 1992). Also, the fact that
Space experiments are conducted in a non-inertial frame becomes more important, and
certainly the effects of variation of G become important (see Bjorkman, 1988; Krikorian
& Levine, 1991; Halstead etal., 1992; Ding & Pickard, 1993; Ingber, 1993, and references
therein).

N ASA has made some effort at developing a system for mass cultUre of cells on Earth
that simulates some characteristics of u-G, with the intent of being able ultimately to
establish systematically the capability of the system to mimic some of the above-mentioned
consequences of the Space environment. A very low shear environment culture vessel, a

so-called slow turning lateral bioreactor vessel (STLV)—with a volume of about 250 m1,
“zero headspace,” a lateral or horizontal cylindrical conﬁguration, an air pump for gentle
continuous gas flow, and an internal silicone gas-exchange membrane—has been de-
signed primarily to allow growth of anchorage-dependent human or other animal cells on
micrometer-diameter microbeads (see Lewis et al., 1987, 1993, for photographs and
schematic diagrams of the system). But the STLV system seems to have some potential
for growing plant cells and even seedlings as well. Reactor vessels such as the STLV
nominally provide to cells some biomechanical aspects of microgravity. These include
minimal-impact cell collisons, low mechanical shear stress, enhanced culture homogene-
ity, and altered substrate distribution. The vessel design allows operation over a wide
range of shear forces and hence allows any thresholds to be determined. Nevertheless,
only after protracted use in Space and comparison of results with those obtained on Earth
will it be possible to gauge the extent to which the effects of Space conditions on cells
are partially or wholly simulated by such bioreactors.

B. SOME OBJECTIVES OF SPACE EXPERIMENTATION

A maj or goal of spaceﬂight experimentation with plants is to seek answers to questions
such as these: How do plants detect and respond to gravity? What are the short- and
long-term effects of near—weightlessness on plants? Can plants adapt successfully to
long-term weightlessness? Can countermeasures such as centrifugation be utilized to
eliminate any untoward effects of the Space environment? Before direct and far-reaching
questions like these can be effectively addressed, a number of technologies need to be
developed and perfected. One is the deceptively simple technology of growing plants
reliably in Space. Procedures that are routine on Earth often need to be handled in
imaginative ways and will need to be made consistent under novel and still poorly defined
conditions. Some progress has been made in this area, but there is a long way to go before
many outstanding questions are answered and problems are resolved. Most of the scien-
tiﬁc community is unaware of the ongoing practical difficulties encountered in attempting
to satisfactorily grow plants in Space (see Krikorian & Levine, 1991; Salisbury, 1991a,
1991b, and references there cited). Only now are some of the questions and hypotheses
being sufficiently reﬁned to be tested effectively. In addition to seeking answers to
questions such as the fundamental ones just posed, there is also an increasing awareness
of the need to address these issues in as much detail as possible. This includes not only
describing responses at the organismal, organ, tissue, and cell level (Keefe & Krikorian,
1983; Halstead & Scott, 1984, 1990; Halstead & Dutcher, 1987; Halstead et al., 1991;
Schaeffer et al., 1993; Dutcher et al., 1994; Nechitailo & Mashinsky, 1993, and references
cited therein) but also understanding the biochemical basis and molecular mechanisms
underlying the cellular, tissue, and organismal responses (Markert & Krikorian, 1993).

While there are a number of long-appreciated examples of gravitropism involving
intact higher plants (Larsen, 1962; Firn & Myers, 1987; Salisbury, 1993) and higher fungi
(Moore, 1991), and even explanted organs such as the pulvini of grasses (Kaufman et al.,
1995), that may be identified as candidate test systems for studying differences after
exposure to changes in gravity, there is relatively little known about cells outside the plant
body (Moroz, 1984; Todd, 1989, 1991). For example, one would like to know whether
u-G has an effect on developmental, physiological, and biochemical processes and
whether “gravity unloading” affects cells that are specialized for G-sensing (Sievers &
Volkmann, 1979; Bjorkman, 1988; Sack, 1991 , 1993) in ways that are different from those
that are not specialized for G-sensing (Dennison, 1961; Varju et al., 1961; Sulzman et al.,

1984; De Groot et al., 1990; Kawasaki et al., 1991; Todd, 1993). It is anticipated that
carefully selected cell and tissue systems growing in “-6 can be used to probe some of
the questions that relate to either of these cell types (Table 1). Additionally, there is
considerable interest in growing and utilizing cultured cells for biotechnology purposes
(Cogoli & Tschopp, 1982; Keefe & Krikorian, 1983; Krikorian, 1985; Morrison, 1987;
Zimmermann et al., 1988).

For example, because of gravity, on Earth the contents of bioreactors must be mixed
in order to obtain a proper distribution of nutrients, oxygen, temperature, and pH
environment (e.g., see Jensen, 1979: fig. 2; and the bioreactor designs in Prenosil &
Pedersen, 1983; Scheld et al., 1985; Scragg et al., 1987; Kargi & Rosenberg, 1987;
Moo-Young & Chisti, 1988; Scragg, 1990; Constabel & Tyler, 1994). This mixing creates
a harsh hydrodynamic shear environment detrimental to sensitive cells (Prokop & Rosen-
berg, 1989; Papoutsakis & Michaels, 1993). If not mixed properly, cells tend to congregate
and, by zone sedimentation, fall to the bottom of the culture vessel or bioreactor.
Furthermore, the requirements for oxygenation frequently creates a foaming in the
bioreactor which also tends to perturb and otherwise damage cells. These factors often
limit the uniformity of the concentration and density of the bioreactor nutrient culture
medium. On Earth, it is known that concentration and density of the solution are directly
linked to the optimal performance of bioreactors: the higher the density, the more
cost-effective the bioreactor “run” (Staba, 1985; Scragg et al., 1987; Fowler et al., 1990;
Doran, 1993; Wilson & Hilton, 1995).

In “-6, zone sedimentation essentially disappears, which should reduce the aggrega-
tion of cultured cells. Moreover, only gentle mixing is required to distribute nutrients and
oxygen. For instance, 12-6 is predicted to alter the mass transfer coefficients for transfer
of oxygen into the medium and from the medium to a cell or enzyme. These factors should
permit higher concentrations and densities to be achieved in a low-G environment.
Additionally, since the cells do not need to maintain the same surface forces that they
require in Earth-normal gravity, they should be able to divert more energy sources for
growth (Cogoli & Gmﬁnder, 1991; Tairbekov, 1991) and differentiation and, in theory at
least, the biosynthesis of more product, or even novel products the production of which
would be unpredictable. Because, again in theory, one can impose different levels of G
force on these cell systems by centrifugation (e.g., see Waterman et al., 1978; Stolzenburg
et al., 1984) and other means, one can test in Space the consequences of increasing or
decreasing G (i.e., hyper-G to hypo-G, respectively) on metabolic pathways such as
secondary product biosynthesis (see DiCosmo & Towers, 1983; Neumann et al., 1985;
Robins & Rhodes, 1988; Verpoorte et al., 1991; Endres, 1994).

Some work has already been carried out on a variety of plant cells in Space that
indicates that metabolism, productivity, and differentiation characteristics are altered (see
Mesland, 1987; Cogoli & Gmﬁnder, 1991; Krikorian et al., 1992; Dutcher et al., 1994).
Whether this might be due to decreased cell interactions (contacts) when cells are freely
suspended is not known. C1ear1y,the many opportunities to study these responses should
eventually lead to a better understanding of the mechanisms by which plant cells control
production of secondary metabolites and other cell products. With this knowledge, control
of enhanced, sustained production of product by cells might be possible.

Somewhat parenthetically, earlier suggestions that unicellular algae (Krauss, 1962) or
aseptically grown plant cell cultures might be amenable to use as a food source directly
(Byrne & Koch, 1962; Hi1debrandtetal., 1963) have long since been abandoned, although
there may be some specialized situations where this might be done (see Sidorenko eta1.,

production of tomato fruits from aseptically cultured thin layers (Compton & Veilleux,
1991, 1992). Even so, it may turn out that unexpected biosynthetic potential may be
expressed in the Space environment (DiCosmo & Towers, 1983; Collin, 1987; Morrison,
1987; Chasan, 1991; Petersen & Alfermann, 1993). The beauty of Space investigation is
that virtually everything is unexplored and there is much to learn. Sometimes one forgets
that growing plants on Earth is one of humankind’s most ancient “biotechnologies”; yet
plant biologists are in the unprecedented predicament of having to learn to grow plants
as efﬁciently as possible in a novel environment thus far rudimentarily tested from the
biological point of view (Halstead & Scott, 1984; Krikorian & Levine, 1991; Merkys &
Laurinaviéius, 1991; Salisbury 1991a, 1991b; Krikorian et al., 1992; Nechitailo &
Mashinsky, 1993; Schaeffer et al., 1993, and references cited therein).

In order to evaluate any of these potentials in each of these instances, whether real or
hypothesized, one obviously needs to have well-defined conditions for maintaining and
growing not only intact plants in Space but also their cells, tissues, and organs in vitro in
Space. -

carried out in the u-G environment will be confronted with a number of constraints at
both the planning level and the implementation level. It may be anticipated, moreover,
that these constraints will need to be taken into consideration for the foreseeable future
no matter the specific growing environment for a given system or the exact nature of the
Space vehicle or orbiting Space platform (Krikorian & Levine, 1991; Cogoli & Gmiinder,
1991). There will be relatively limited access to power on all spacecraft since energy is
not yet available in generous amounts even in relatively large facilities, such as the Space
Shuttle or the Space Station, due to solar array technology and a hesitancy to rely on
nuclear energy. Certainly, power will more than likely always be limiting in smaller
orbiting satellites (Krikorian, 1990). Only a few astronauts or payload specialists will be
available to carry out manipulations or experimental procedures on behalf of a great many
investigators whose interests span a range of scientific and engineering disciplines. It is
certain that they will be on strict schedules and that access to their services will be highly
competitive. Equally important, for the foreseeable future there will be only a few
scheduled visits a year from various space vehicles such as the Space Shuttle to the Space
Station, and there will be substantial intervals between these visits. This means that
materials from experiments terminated in Space—i.e., those that must be collected and
returned to Earth for subsequent study, analysis, and interpretation—need to be retained
on orbit after completion. There is certain to be considerable competition for storage room
in Space, and one has to ensure that materials will withstand the rigors and possible
hazards of storage and their ultimate return to Earth. Live samples must be kept alive,
frozen samples must be kept frozen, fixed materials must be maintained in satisfactory
condition. Similar problems will also have to be dealt with in the course of initiating an
experiment destined for the Space environment as well. In some cases, the biological
materials for an experiment will need to be established and set up on Earth, transferred
to a launch vehicle, and ultimately put in place at its final destination (e.g., the Space
Station). Experiments will need to be prepared on Earth and launched into Space. In the
United States, experiments are generally prepared at the Kennedy Space Center, Florida,
in the Life Sciences Biological Research Support Facility. Experiment preparations are
initiated at a specified time prior to what is referred to as “turn-over,” i.e., when the
experimental material set up or installed in appropriately designed “hardware” leaves the
hands of the investigator and is taken to the launch pad to be put on board the Space
Shuttle. For technical reasons related to safety and engineering concerns, the very latest
that this “turn-over” can occur is 16 hours before launch (so-called L minus 16). This
means that cells and tissues must be maintained in an appropriate state from the time they
leave the investigator to the time of actual lift-off. While there have been many lift-offs
that have met scheduled timetables, there are many cases of launch delays (termed “slips”)
when all the “launch commit criteria” are not met. There is an official procedure that is
followed in the event that slips are required for reasons of weather, engineering problems,
and so forth, and it is a real possibility that an experiment may need to be prepared de
novo a number of times to ensure the quality of material being launched. Obviously, the
more tolerant a given system is to insults and delays, the less worrisome these “scrub
turn-arounds” become.

This is all to say that the simpler and more self-contained or automated an experiment
can be, the better. This applies not only to experiments using cultured cells and tissues
but to all experiments. But the level of automation required for cell culture and its
complexity, and hence the associated cost (especially for the kind of automation that will
provide redundancy so as to permit trouble-free operation over extended periods), pres-

ently argues against full automation. Moreover, it is expected that building up to complete
automation will be a gradual process, since scientists and engineers will inevitably have
to learn through experimentation, both in the laboratory on Earth and under “real”
conditions of spaceﬂight, the best way to accomplish desired objectives (Fig. 1). Justifi-
ably, there is considerable concern about “dedicated” versus “generic” hardware, the latter
being equipment that is not experiment-speciﬁc but widely applicable and hence usable
by many investigators. There is also concern that there be a prudent balance between
simplicity and flexibility. In any case, there is little justification in carrying out potentially
costly designs and redesigns unless there is considerable evidence that what is being
developed has a reasonable chance of working well for a significant number of re-
searchers. In the very least, plant cell culture experiments (and animal cell culture ones,
for that matter) should be designed so they can be activated and terminated in Space at
will (by the nature of the experimental design, by automatic means, or by human
intervention).

The more usual means of taking samples during the course of an experiment or
terminating it will, of course, involve fixation for histological examination and such or
the rapid freezing of samples for subsequent (bio)chemical analysis upon return to Earth.
But there will be instances when investigators may wish to carry out an experiment,
perform fixations and freezings, and retain live samples as well. But while initiating and
terminating an experiment on Earth under aseptic conditions may seem easy enough, there
are many situations where even achieving, much less maintaining, asepsis is not that
simple, and it becomes even more difficult when one needs sterility for extended periods
(Tiner, 1963; Wallhausser, 1982). Similarly, performing fixations and freezing of samples
is routine enough on Earth, but accomplishing these tasks safely in 11-6 is no trivial feat,
given the need to isolate redundantly or “triply contain” toxic materials such as glutaral-
dehyde from the open environment and the challenge of keeping things frozen (Schulze
et al., 1992).

The task of keeping cultures healthy and vigorous is especially demanding if an
experiment is to last longer than a relatively brief period—longer than, say, a matter of
several days or a couple of weeks. But a major advantage afforded by an orbiting vehicle
like Space Station Alpha is that biological scientists (and others) will have access to
extended duration u-G environments for investigating the role of gravity in various
systems. This may, for example, take the form of a given experiment being carried out to
term over a long period with samplings made at appropriate intervals; it could also be an
experiment of relatively short duration that is initiated, sampled periodically, terminated,
and re-initiated using fresh materials that have been “withdrawn” along the line. Such
“repetitive” or “end-to-end” experiments provide not only multiple samples for statistical
purposes but also an opportunity to study adaptation of biological systems to u-G and
other Space conditions over a long period without the logistical challenge of providing
an appropriate growing environment for an extended period. Some would argue, in fact,
that more reliable experimentation could be carried out if it were initiated, sampled over
time, terminated, and re-initiated. Of course, the experimental objective(s) would deter-
mine the exact protocol. Seen from a perspective of the need to manage cell cultures, one
would perforce be controlling cells in preflight activities, in-flight activities, and post-
flight activities.

But the subject is arguably more important and much broader than any of the foregoing
implies. Indeed, the area to be covered in this review should have wider appeal than only
to workers interested in gravitational and Space biology. The challenge presented by

dealing with plant cell cultures during extended spaceﬂight has considerable practical
applications on Earth. For example, most plant tissue culture laboratories, both research
and commercial, are faced with the chore of maintaining cumbersome inventories and are
continually frustrated by the ongoing and labor-intensive activity of initiating cultures de
novo on a routine basis, carrying out transfers and subcultures (see George & Sherrington,
1984; George, 1993). While most commercial micropropagation or aseptically based plant
multiplication utilizes relatively large explants such as stem tips or lateral buds as the
starting material for clonal expansion, there is increasing interest in evaluating the
potential for utilizing embryogenic cells and bioreactors to achieve truly massive numbers
(Krikorian, 1982; Ammirato & Styer, 1985; Krikorian et al., 1986; Preil et al., 1988; Gray
& Purohit, 1991; Preil, 1991). Both research and commercial workers would welcome
insights into devices or strategies that permit the task of conserving various cell and tissue
lines for long periods but without risk of diminished potential for regrowth and regenera-
tion of cultures or even of plants at a much later date. The problem of managing cultures
for a practical end must, however, rely on a judicious combination of basic scientific
principles and technology, for it ultimately comes down to the task of utilizing facts of
cell and tissue physiology for the management of growth. It is for this reason that some
classic references are included despite the fact they were written, in some cases, some
time ago.

Against the above background and despite the fact that the topic both is quite novel
and has a relatively small literature, it is appropriate now to attempt a synthesis and
analysis of potentially useful strategies. It is hoped that (1) attention will be drawn to
problems that still need solution and hence the analysis will serve a heuristic purpose,
and (2) researchers will be made aware of some of the major scientiﬁc and logistical

challenges that they will face in performing experiments with plant cells and tissues in
Space.

It will not be easy but it is obviously better to approach the challenge armed, as it
were, with as much information as possible.
III. Concepts and Semantics of “Minimal or Zero Growth”

Understandably, work with cell cultures of higher plants (or of lower plant forms, for
that matter) is seldom framed in the context of maintaining cells with “minimal or no
growth” at the beginning of, during, or at the end of an experiment. One can, of course,
facetiously interpret “zero growth” as the state of being dead; indeed, Preyer, ca. 1891,
referred to “zero growth” as being in an anabiotic state, i.e., lifeless and viable or lifeless
and not viable, or “dead” (Leblos und lebensfc‘ihig = anabiotisch; Leblos und lebensun-
fdhig = tot) (cited in Keilin, 1959). What is meant by “zero growth” in this review is that
cells can grow but their potential to do so has been interrupted or severely curtailed. It
follows that zero growth could be due to a shutdown of the system, for instance, for lack
of an essential nutrient, a critical respiratory gas (e.g., oxygen or carbon dioxide), or a
physiologically appropriate temperature.

The term “anabiosis,” or “return to life,” from the German Wiederbelegung, was
applied years ago to the condition of “resuscitation, or resurrection of completely lifeless
but viable organisms” (Keilin, 1959: 24). The term was extended to mean the “state of
viable lifelessness.” Similarly, “abiosis” was used for a while, but the term was viewed
as “too close to the terms abiotic and abiogenesis which are used in a very different sense
. . . dealing with the problem of the origin of life” (Keilin, 1959). In a now classic paper,
Keilin (1959) summarized the historical relationships (see Fig. 2) of these terms and
coined a new word, “cryptobiosis,” meaning “latent life, for the state of an organism when
it shows no visible signs of life when its metabolic activity becomes hardly measurable,
or comes reversibly to a standstill.”

In the context of recognizing the range of conditions that “can bring about different
states of biosis, including latent life or cryptobiosis,” Keilin (1959: 26) went on to list
“loss of water, lowering of temperature, absence of oxygen and high salt concentration,
or any combination of these factors” and summarized the relationships in the scheme in
Figure 3. Halvorson (1961) early adopted Keilin’s terminology but emphasized that
“among various forms that exhibit reduced metabolism to a remarkable degree, there is
no sharp dividing line between a state of hypometabolism and ametabolism. Halvorson
(1961) emphasized that “in dealing with the state of cryptobiosis . . . one must necessarily
refer to some of the borderline cases. A state of cryptobiosis is certainly not limited to
any single area of biology. One can find good examples among plants and animals and
micro-organisms . . . the seeds of plants; plant buds; the dehydrated forms of all kinds of
micro-organisms, such as protozoa; bacteria; fungi and algae; viable forms rendered
inactive by freezing; the cysts of protozoa; and the spores of bacteria.” Certainly, plant
cells grown in vitro qualify for inclusion in the list. Understandably, as a bacteriologist,
Halvorson (1961) seems to have preferred the term “dormancy”; indeed, this term seems
quite appropriate for microbial spores. But to most plant biologists, especially those
dealing with the problems of dormancy, the word normally suggests problems associated
with seed germination and bud break (Crocker, 1948; Vegis, 1964; Clutter, 1978).

Despite the above range of terminology, a literature search by computer using the
words in Figures 2 and 3 as key words turns out to be unsuccessful in disclosing relevant

literature that might shed light on the problem at hand. It may be that the various databases
simply do not use these somewhat archaic terms. Similarly, there is very little, if anything,
published in the Space biology literature that can directly guide a prospective investigator
in experimentation with cultured cells in an environment such as a Space station. The
field is simply too new and the average length of most Space biology experiments
performed to date much too short to be of real value. It is clear, then, that the solution to
our technical problems will have to be derived or adapted from areas peripheral to the
one that might have, on the surface at least, been viewed as most closely related.

It is of no little interest that the literature of germplasm conservation, cryopreservation,
secondary product biosynthesis, immobilization, and bioreactors provides the best leads.
But before attention is directed to the specific strategies that might be utilized for our
stated objectives, it will be worthwhile to analyze what one is perforce dealing with in
terms of the biology of the cell cultures. Although this may seem obvious, certain points
are critical to the emergence of any effective solutions.

IV. Plant “Cell” Cultures: Again a Case of Semantics

plant research (see Krikorian, 1982; Mantell & Smith, 1983; George & Sherrington, 1984;

as a common laboratory tool, plant tissue and cell culture per se has become somewhat
less of a methodological preoccupation than it once was. But the fact remains that, despite
a plethora of handbooks and laboratory guides, there is a considerable amount of what
might best be termed elusive cell biology or art that is inevitably involved with the
growing of plant cells in vitro. This in itself constitutes a limitation to plant cell and tissue
culture being reduced to a “simple” technique, achievable with “routine” procedures. A
serious consequence of the view that plant tissue culture is merely a tool is that many
so—called systems are being accepted as highly reliable. Indeed, some cultures are widely
and confidently accepted as “systems” (see De Vries et a1., 1988; De Jong et a1., 1992;
Komamine et a1., 1992; Kiyosue et a1., 1993; Sato et a1., 1995).

Inevitably, plant cell cultures vary in their physiological, growth, and developmental
parameters and capacities. Indeed, cultures can and often do show tremendous heteroge-
neities because it is not easy to initiate and sustain cultures, and selection processes
inevitably take place during cultivation and subculture (Steward et a1., 1975; Yeoman,
1976; Dix, 1986, 1990; Krikorian & Smith, 1992; George, 1993). While attention is
frequently drawn to the nominal advantages of uniformity, the frequently clonal nature
of cell cultures, and so on, it is only much less often that the potential lack of uniformity
and drawbacks of cell cultures, are mentioned, much less emphasized (Steward et a1.,
1958; Laetch, 1971; Torrey, 1971; Krikorian, 1982, 1988, 1989).

A. “CELL” CULTURES V

When plant tissues are cultured in suitably agitated liquid media, single cells and small
clusters of cells may frequently be found suspended in the liquid. This fact, established
in the 19503, enabled the question to be raised whether these suspensions, when ﬁltered
free from the large clusters of cells, could be manipulated by methods used routinely with
microorganisms. Certain types of investigations previously conducted with microorgan-
isms were viewed as being approachable with higher plant cells, and problems peculiar

to higher plants were viewed as being approachable in new ways using simple microbio-
logical techniques (Muir et a1., 1954, 1958; Steward et a1., 1958; Bergmann, 1959, 1960;
Nickel], 1962; Ball& Joshi, 1965; Gibbs & Dougall, 1963, 1965; Blakely, 1964; Konar,
1966).

Although analogies were early drawn between plant cell suspensions and microorgan-
isms, and these have since been repeated in the plant biological literature so often as to
have become dogma to the unwary, it is well to underscore several very important
differences. Many thousands of “average-size” bacteria could occupy the same volume
as one average-size aseptically cultured carrot (Daucus carota) or Haplopappus gracilis
cell. For example, most bacterial cells of the cocci type have a volume of about 1 um3;
rods might be some three times that (e.g., see Salle, 1967: 66). Although there is
tremendous variation in cell size among a population of “free” cells of plants, an average
size would be, say, on the order of 100,000 ,um3, in a sphericalce1160 pm in diameter or
in a very elongated ce1120 um in diameter and 300 um long. Generation times in bacteria
may be as short as 20 minutes (Salle, 1967), whereas in cultured plant cells, average
generation times are more commonly measured in several hours or even days (Yeoman,
1976; Rost & Gifford, 1977; Gould, 1984; Francis, 1992, and references therein).
Microorganisms are generally more uniform in size and shape than free plant cells. It may
even be hard to find two cells exactly alike in a suspension of plant cells. It is often not
difficult to find two cells of a suspension, in a small sample of cells, that differ in length
by a factor of 10 or more (see Torrey, 1957, 1966; Steward et a1., 1958; Ball & Joshi,
1965). For example, many “free” cells of certain carrot strains tend to be cigar-shaped,
but oval to nearly isodiametric cells are also present. Even among elongate cells, it is a
simple matter to distinguish cells from one another by one or more morphological
features. It is a truism that cells in clusters tend to be smaller and more isodiametric than
free single cells. Table 11 provides a summary of some of the more important differences
between bacteria and plant cells in vitro.

A comprehensive account of the variation in the morphology of cultured cells would
serve no useful purpose here. Suffice it to say that it would be ideal, for some purposes,
if daughter cells separated immediately upon completion of cell division, and suspensions
consisted entirely of single cells. However, as a plant cell divides, the daughter cells do
not separate completely but tend normally to remain more or less firmly attached to the
middle lamella. Methods are not yet available that completely circumvent this condition
(Steward et a1., 1958, 1975; Torrey & Reinert, 1961 ; Torrey et a1., 1962; Street & Henshaw,
1963; Yeoman, 1986; Constabel & Shyluk, 1994). Indeed, it may be argued that it is more
than likely doing violence to the inherent biology of a multicellular plant to expect that
its constituent tissues and cells should be reducible in vitro so as to grow and persist in
the form of single cells (see Barlow & Carr, 1984; Steeves & Sussex, 1989; Lyndon, 1990;
Sachs, 1991; Fosket, 1994). But there are some plant cell cultures that are said to grow
and multiply predominantly but not exclusively from single cells (see Street et a1., 1971
for a description of a so-called nonadhesive “mutant line” of sycamore maple, Acer
pseudoplatanus). Interestingly, addition of a polygalacturonase such as Macerozyme to
a level of 0.05% w/v and a cellulase like Onozuka P1500 (0.01% w/v) did not prevent the
subculturability of such cultures and allowed a “persistent high level of cell separation”
(Street et a1., 1971: 22). (It may be noted, however, that after some 37 years of personal
experience with plant cell suspensions from many different species and visits to many
tissue culture laboratories scattered throughout the world, I have never encountered one
cell culture that could be sustained from absolutely single cells.)

Another inaccurate analogy that has been sometimes drawn between plant cells in
suspension and bacteria and other microorganisms and unicellular algae is that cultured
plant cells are genetically homogeneous (clonal) and that they generally express genetic
information in ways comparable to those occurring in intact plants (see D’Amato, 1977;
Krikorian et al., 1982; Snowcroft, 1985; Yamada & Mino, 1986; Karp, 1989, 1991, 1994,

instances where successes have been achieved, it was only because haploidy or a single

dominant gene was involved, there was straightforward expression of the trait in question,
and there was adequate plating efficiency and plantlet recovery from the “cells” (Negrutiu
et a1., 1984). It is true, on the other hand, that unless speciﬁc tailor-made precautions are
taken to ensure that a culture is otherwise (e.g., Krikorian, 1982; Krikorian et al., 1983b;
Fitter & Krikorian, 1988), higher plant cells have a tendency to be genetically diverse
(see Larkin & Snchroft, 1981; Krikorian et a1., 1982; Snowcroft, 1985 ; Yamada & Mino,
1986; Larkin, 1987; Larkin et a1., 1989; Peschke & Phillips, 1992; Kaeppler & Phillips,
1993; Karp, 1989, 1991, 1994, and references cited therein).

B. “UNITS”

There are strong indications that the adhesions between daughter cells weaken upon
cell enlargement (Torrey et a1., 1962; Street & Henshaw, 1963; Wallner & Nevins, 1974;
Hayashi & Yoshida, 1988; Knox, 1992; Liners et a1., 1994). Thus, it is to be expected that
some cell lines are more friable and can release smaller units than others. In the late 1950s
and early 1960s, when pioneer “cell suspension” and nominally “free cell” culture work
was being carried out at Cornell University in the laboratory of F. C. Steward, terminology
was adopted to handle the reality that “cells” of multicellular plants did not grow in
suspension in ways that precluded the presence of cell clusters or aggregates (Blakely,
1964). More precisely, cultures very rarely, if ever, grow as single cells. “Unit,” an
umbrella term designating that each discrete member of a suspension, be it a single cell
or a small group of cells, seemed to fit the need (Blakely & Steward, 1964). Adrian Srb,
a Cornell geneticist and close friend of Steward, had used the term “unit” for discrete
members of haploid yeast suspensions; it emphasized that microorganisms in suspension
often occurred in small groups as well as single cells (Srb, 1956). For example, in haploid
yeast (Saccharomyces cerevisiae), only some 31% comprised single cells, 45% were
clusters of 2—8 cells, while some 24% of the “units” consisted of 9 or more cells.

Whereas it has long been recognized that it is virtually impossible to obtain cultures
of higher plant cells that consist exclusively of, and are propagated or grown as, single
cells, investigators appear to have been more reluctant to admit that this presents a
hindrance to certain kinds of experimentation. At the very least, if suspensions were to
consist only of single cells, certain experimental results could be interpreted in more
precise terms. For instance, even counting cells in a given volume of suspension becomes
more than a casual activity (Brown & Rickless, 1949; Brown & Broadbent, 1950; Letham,
1962).

Single graviresponsive cells would, of course, offer a unique and valuable system with
which to study the cellular mechanisms involved, for instance, in gravitropism. In the
roots of higher plants, many cell types participate in gravitropism, and the sites of
graviperception and gravicurvature are generally substantially separated (e.g., in the
rootcap and in the stelar zone of elongation, respectively). Both the size and the complex-
ity of such systems make it difﬁcult to analyze precisely the temporal, spatial, and
biochemical factors that may or may not affect gravitropism. However, in single-cell
systems, the gravitropic response is contained entirely within one isolated cell, and thus
the range of possible inﬂuencing factors is substantially limited. Graviresponsive single-
cell systems also possess a number of other characteristics that make them preferred
subjects for the analysis of gravitropism. Single cells are excellent subjects for both light
and electron microscopy. For example, it is much easier to obtain an undisturbed and
sharper view of the protoplast of single cells using Nomarski optics than with multicel-
lular units or tissues, because single cells are thinner and because of the proximity of their

cytoplasm to the cell surface. For the same reasons, the native organization of a cell should
be preserved by freezing techniques, such as freeze substitution, better than it is in
multicellular units, tissues, or organs (Lancelle et al., 1986). Similarly, graviresponsive
single cells are more amenable to experimental treatment such as microinjection and
bathing with (bio)chemicals. Finally, because graviperception and curvature occur in
close proximity in single-cell systems, it is possible to integrate the analysis of those
processes. As already mentioned, however, there are a number of reasons other than the
study of gravitropism at the cell level to warrant the study of higher plant cells in the
space environment. Even here, however, the smaller the unit size being exposed to a
discrete environment, the better. From the perspective of experimentation in “-6, it is
readily arguable that a single cell ﬂoating in a nutritive environment is perhaps best
viewed as receiving external stimuli equally from all directions. In a unit consisting of
two or more cells, a cell receives two different types of stimuli: those from the external
medium and those from the adjacent or neighboring cell(s) (Fig. 4). All of this means that
experiments must be carefully framed and interpretation of results rigorously limited to
the facts of the status of cells being tested.

Similarly, although genetic heterogeneity may be expected to exist in any long-
established cell suspension culture (D’Amato, 1977; Krikorian et al., 1982; Karp, 1991,
1994), it is a fact that the cells in any single, free group or unit could have derived from
a single cell in the recent history of the unit. Small groups of cells in a suspension may
arise as a result of division in free single cells, but this is recognized as a very rare
occurrence, and it occurs only under special culture conditions (e.g., see Komamine et
al., 1992). Much more commonly, small groups of cells fragment off as units from larger
ones, sometimes through a process resembling abscission. In larger groups, any genetic
heterogeneity would tend to be distributed among sectors, as a consequence of the manner
in which plant cells divide. The cells resulting from a series of related divisions tend to
remain attached and localized. When small groups split off from a larger, genetically
sectored group, they would more frequently derive from within sectors than they would
from the more restricted areas overlapping two genetically different sectors, purely on
the basis of chance. This would be analogous to the behavior in intact plants where, as
Neilson-Jones (1937: 546) has stated, the sectorial chimera “may be comparatively stable,
so far as the branch is concerned, but is not so in respect to lateral branches, the character
of any branch depending on the position in which the bud producing it arose on the main
stem. Only those buds arising at the junction between the components will have a
chimaeral structure; the rest, forming the majority, will be composed entirely of one or
the other component” (see also D’Amato, 1977: 82 et seq.; Poethig, 1989).

C. PROTOPLASTS

Enzymatic isolations, en masse, of viable wall-less cells (protoplasts) from cells,
tissues, and organs have been familiar since 1960 (see Krikorian, 1982; Fitter & Kri-
korian, 1983; Fowke & Constabel, 1985; Whitney & Beuschel, 1988; Power et al., 1989;
Bajaj, 1994, and references cited therein). Cellulases and pectinases, generally derived
from certain wood-degrading fungi, capable of dissolving the intercellular components
and cell wall, are routinely used to release protoplasts from the tissues and organs of
different plants and especially their aseptically derived and cultured tissues and cells
(Fitter & Krikorian, 1983; Evans & Bravo, 1983). Having reconstituted walls around
them, they are able to divide, proliferate, and, in some instances, eventually yield plants
(Packer & Douce, 1987; Puite, 1988; Roest & Gilissen, 1989, and references cited

therein). In still other cases, having obtained naked protoplasts, and having overcome the
barrier to cell fusion inherent in the cell wall, fusion of protoplasts may lead to
non-heterokaryotic nuclei and production of reconstituted cells from which new
plants can grow. If the protoplasts were from haploid cells (as from anther or ovule
culture), new diploid cells could be produced in a sort of artificial syngamy (parasexual
or somatic hybridization). In select cases one envisions the exploitation of the methods
in the production of novel plants, even between evolutionarily disparate organisms, by
fusion breeding techniques (see Hammerschlag & Litz, 1992). Successful production and
growth of protoplasts into plantlets is frequently the key feature in the implementation of
genetic transformation/engineering studies (Gelvin et al., 1988; Filatti, 1990; Grierson,
1991; Negrutiu & Gharti-Chhetri, 1991; Kung & Wu, 1992). The environmental require-
ments for regeneration, chemical composition, and biochemical activity of walls are not
well understood (Showalter, 1993), and regeneration media are often complex and must
have a high osmoticum base in the form of additives like mannitol, sorbitol, inositol,
sucrose, and such to prevent bursting of the wall-less cells (Fitter & Krikorian, 1983;
Puite, 1988). Once walls are formed, the resultant cells are grown in the way specific for
“cells” of the plant species in question. Bornman and Zachrisson (1982) were able to show
that anchoring to microcarriers, such as those used with animal cells, works reasonably
well with plants.

Again, it is possible to envision investigators wishing to maintain and grow cell
cultures and attempt to regenerate and grow plant protoplasts or to study their products
such as extracellular matrix. Iversen and co-workers (Iversen, 1985; Rasmussen, 1987;
Iversen et al., 1990) and Zimmermann et a1. (1988) have given considerable attention to
protoplasts in the context of their vision of plant cell biology in Space, termed by them
“Space biotechnology” but just as readily termed “plant cell biology” (see Mesland, 1987,
1992; Cogoli et al., 1989). Zimmermann thus far has been concerned primarily with
electrofusion of higher-plant protoplasts (Vorhoek-Kohler etal., 1983). A major perceived
advantage of carrying out fusions in “-6 includes the idea that it should be possible to
use lower field strengths of the alternating electric field during the alignment or pre-fusion
phase because thermal convection and mixing problems encountered at l-G are mini-

mized. Also, u-G should allow improved performance of the electrofusion process once
the breakdown pulse is applied. All this means that u-G can theoretically be exploited to
position and fuse plant protoplasts under minimal stress conditions.

Attempts have been made to grow protoplasts in Space to gain “basic knowledge of
mechanisms of growth and development under microgravity” (Rasmussen et a1., 1989).
Results of an experiment ﬂown in September 1989 on Kosmos 2044 (Biokosmos 9), by a
collaborative group of Scandinavian and Soviet workers using fresh protoplasts prepared
from suspensions of embryogenic carrot cells and from hypocotyls of rape (Brassica
napus), are of particular interest to us in the context of this review, since they used the
technique of protoplast immobilization in 1% agarose (alginate solution) along with a low
temperature of 4°C to slow down wall regeneration. Speciﬁcally, at 4°C only 6% of the
cells had regenerated walls, as opposed to 60% at 25°C (Rasmussen et a1., 1990). In that
experiment, a signiﬁcant number of “flight” protoplasts did not regenerate walls (in carrot
56% and in rape 82%, compared to ground controls, regenerated walls and grew).
Moreover, cellulose analyses showed a decreased amount. Similarly, peroxidase and total
protein levels were much reduced as well in the ﬂight samples. A signiﬁcant decrease in
plantlet regeneration was observed (Rasmussen et a1., 1989, 1990). Unfortunately, l-G
centrifuge controls (however imperfect they might be) were not performed, and hence it
is not possible to unequivocally attribute the results to “-6. It could well be that indirect
factors or spaceﬂight conditions not readily simulated on Earth (Mesland, 1992) were
responsible (Table 111).

Special but relatively unsophisticated apparatus was designed by the Scandinavian
group to accommodate the protoplasts (for photographic and diagrammatic details of this
apparatus see Rasmussen, 1987: 109, fig. 3; Rasmussen et a1., 1989: fig. 6; Iversen et a1.,
1990: ﬁg. 1; Rasmussen et a1., 1990: fig. 1). The “Zimmerrnann apparatus” is more
specialized (Zimmermann, 1982) and was at one time commercially available.

V. Low Temperature Strategies

A. CRYOPRESERVATION

It has been known for many years that plant cells can tolerate chilling and even
freezing (see Molisch, 1897 [in translation, 1982]; Levitt, 1972, 1980; Withers & Street,
1977; Withers, 1980; Kartha, 1982, 1985; James, 1983; Li, 1984; Grout& Morris, 1987).
The enormous potential of applying zero-growth or minimal-growth strategies (routinely
used for gene banks; see Ellis et a1., 1985) for maintaining nonseed germplasm has been
recognized for many years (Withers, 1980, 1983, 1985, 1986; Kartha, 1982, 1985; Seitz
et a1., 1985; Adams & Adams, 1991; Kartha & Engelmann, 1994).

At the outset of the research work on cryopreservation, efforts in this area were
focused equally on callus, suspension cells, somatic embryos, and shoot tips or apical
meristems. Attention was paid to solving such problems as (1) which cryoprotectants
to use, e.g., dimethylsulfoxide (DMSO) or glycerol or polyethylene glycol (PEG) or
sugars such as glucose or sucrose and various combinations thereof, sometimes includ-
ing proline etc.; (2) cooling rates, ranging from very slow at, say, 1° or 2°C per min
for cell suspensions, callus, and organized small propagules, to 50° to >1000°C per
min for certain stern tips; (3) details of the final quenching of initially slowly frozen
samples; (4) maintaining very low temperature in liquid nitrogen (order of —150° or
—196°C in the liquid or vapor phases, respectiveIY); and (5) rapid thawing (usually with
a warm water bath at 35-40°C). Efforts to cryopreserve in vitro cultured and multiplied

shoot tips were typically constrained by low levels of success; certain species, espe-
cially those of tropical and subtropical genera, were frequently designated as more or
less completely recalcitrant (see Engelmann, 1991). Also in that period, the number of
recoverable apices after thawing even in those cases where freezing was nominally
successful was very unpredictable (Sakai, 1984).

N ow there is a vast literature that deals with cryopreservation of apical meristems of
higher plants, and there has been considerable attention given to a fairly broad range of
cell types, including various stage somatic embryos and even protoplasts (Kartha, 1985;
Kartha & Engelmann, 1994; Benson, 1995; Day & McLellan, 1995 and references cited
therein). While progress at the applied level has been relatively slow until recently,
investigator persistence shows signs of paying off. For example, a conventional freezing
protocol is described by Gnanapragasam and Vasil (1990) for embryogenic suspension
cultures of sugarcane, a tropical species very sensitive to low temperatures (Moore, 1987).
Centrifuged suspensions were chilled on ice, and pre-chilled cryoprotectants were added
to the cells over a period of one hour with agitation. Aliquots of this suspension were
dispensed in small cryogenic ampules and frozen in a commercially available apparatus
at a rate of 0.5°C per min to —40°C. After 45 min at —40°C they were stored in liquid
nitrogen. Cells were reestablished and somatic embryos regenerated. The success with
sugarcane emphasizes that nominally recalcitrant tropical species can yield even to
“traditional” cryogenic methods.

It would appear reasonable that cryopreservation could provide a major solution to
some of the problems outlined here in section II. For the time being, however, conven-
tional cryopreservation—i.e., preservation in the frozen state at very low temperatures,
namely, above solid carbon dioxide or dry ice (—79°C), in low-temperature deep freezers
(80°C or below), in vapor phase (ca. -140°C), or in liquid nitrogen (—196°C)—has been
all but excluded for the time being from consideration in the context of managing plant
cell and tissue cultures for experimentation in Space. Reasons for this are that power
requirements are presently prohibitive and the logistics of carrying out necessary proce-
dures impractical (Reinhoud et al., 1995). Moreover, while the number of species ame-
nable to cryopreservation is increasing, it is still relatively small (see Kartha &
Engelmann, 1994: tab. 1). Perhaps of greatest importance is that there is the very real
biological problem of what reestablishment of cultures from cryopreserved cells means
in the context of what is currently technically feasible. For our purposes, cryopreserved

cells should ideally, upon regrowth in aseptic culture, show minimal change physiologi-
cally and biochemically from the cells as they were initially “stopped.” This is no modest
objective, and to expect it to be achievable more or less readily might be doing basic
violence to the known facts of plant cell growth in vitro. In virtually all cases of
regeneration from cryopreserved cultures, little if any attention has been paid to how much
new growth needs to occur in order for regeneration to be achieved. For example,
cryopreserved stem tips can sometimes regenerate new plants, but apical growth is
curtailed in many instances and is replaced by callus proliferation, which, in turn, can
sometimes be manipulated to regenerate plants. Thus, materials so generated are not
directly descended from the apical material initially frozen. In the context of achieving
zero-growth maintenance for Space plant cell biology experimentation using cultured
cells, it is obviously undesirable to regenerate plants indirectly from cells and tissues that
may only poorly reﬂect what they had experienced in Space. The more direct the
regeneration the better.

B. “VITRIFICATION” AN D “HYPERHYDRICITY” IN

THE TISSUE CULTURE LITERATURE

More recent successes in cryopreservation derive from an approach termed “vitri-
fication.” Before “true” vitrification is discussed, however, it should be pointed out
that the term has been used extensively in the plant tissue culture literature to refer to
a condition or physiological state of cells typified by a “glassy” look. Tissues or organs
such as leaves, especially in micropropagated plants, become translucent or almost
transparent and in many cases abnormal organ histology is observable: decrease or lack
of palisade layer (especially in young leaves), presence of a poorly formed or even
totally absent cuticle, and poor vasculature development (Debergh et al., 1981; Kevers
et al., 1984; Paques & Boxus, 1987; Ziv, 1991). Necrosis is not an uncommon
consequence of this condition; consequently, there is considerable concern in the
commercial micropropagation sector, for it is virtually impossible to establish vitreous
plants ex vitro.

The causes of vitrification at the cellular level are poorly understood, but there is
considerable evidence that laboratory manipulations and technique are involved in
fostering its manifestation (Debergh et al., 1981; Kevers et al., 1984; Phan & Hegedus,
1986; Leonhardt & Kandeler, 1987; Leshem et al., 1988). Some laboratories encounter
the problem more than others (Ziv, 1991, and references cited therein). Whatever the
cause(s), there are some empirical measures that can be put in place to avoid the
condition (Paques & Boxus, 1987). All of the measures are more or less based on efforts
to bring about an increase of the water potential of the medium in which materials are
grown. These include, for example, improved aeration (Jackson et al., 1991) and
reduction of water absorption by increasing the concentration of agar in a medium
(Bornman & Vogelmann, 1984; Feito et al., 1994). Sigma Chemical Co. (St. Louis,
Missouri) even offers a so-called Antivitrifying Agent (catalog EMZ, A-0807). Little
information, other than a rough elemental analysis, is provided about this proprietary
preparation used to protect against the vitreous condition. Presumably its activity is
due to its ability to adjust the osmotic environment.

More recently, there has been an attempt to replace the noun “vitrification” with
“hyperhydricity” (Debergh et al., 1992). The latter term, along with its adjectival form
“hyperhydric,” was used many years ago in connection with plant tissue culture (e.g.,

"23","62 THE BOTANICAL REVIEW
Paupardin & Gautheret, 1954). Resurrection and widespread adoption of the term
should allow vitrification to be restricted to its proper place in the context of cryobi-
ology.

C. “VITRIFICATION” IN A CRYOBIOLOGICAL CONTEXT

Fahy et a1. (1984) define vitrification as “the solidification of a liquid brought about
not by crystallization but by an extreme elevation in viscosity during cooling. During
vitrification the solution is said to become a glass; translational molecular motions are
significantly arrested, making the effective end of biological time but without any of the
changes brought about by freezing. An organ capable of being vitriﬁed need no longer
satisfy classical constraints of optimal cooling and warming rates, but instead can neatly
escape both ‘solution effects’ injury and the dangers of intercellular cooling. Vitrification
of relevant aqueous solutions using cooling rates that are realistic for whole organs
requires the presence of high concentrations of a cryoprotective agent. The primary
challenge that must be met in order to successfully vitrify organs, therefore, is to make
the required concentrations of cryoprotectant non-toxic to the organism"" (for an in-depth
analysis of the principles and methodology of vitriﬁcation, see also Hirsch, 1987;
Steponkus et a1., 1992; Kartha & Engelmann, 1994).

Vitrification procedures thus eliminate the need for slow freezing and enhance the
possibility of materials being cryopreserved by direct transfer to liquid nitrogen. This in
turn obviates the need for controlled freezing apparatus and expensive equipment.
Nishizawa et a1. (1993) have shown that cryopreservation of embryogenic cells of
asparagus and subsequent plant regeneration are achievable using vitriﬁcation proce-
dures. These workers used a mixture of glycerol and sucrose in water as a cryoprotectant;
cells were dehydrated, frozen in liquid nitrogen, thawed at 40°C, and recovered at a level
higher than 80%. Although the regenerated plants “looked” similar to control plants,
additional studies are acknowledged as being needed to confirm this. Matsumoto et a1.
(1994) have reported high regeneration of Japanese horseradish (Wasabia japonica)
apical meristems cryopreserved by vitrification. Apices of many potato varieties can now
also be cryopreserved and new growth re-initiated from the same frozen apex without
intervening callus. A cryopreservation project with the objective of placing the entire
germplasm collection of the International Potato Center (CIP) in Lima, Peru, has been
undertaken (P. Steponkus, pers. comm).

Carefully selected, even novel, cryoprotectants and strategies for preconditioning of
materials will play increasingly significant roles in the achieving of success in the
foreseeable future (Benson, 1995). Clearly, the treatment(s) preceding freezing are very
important, and such techniques as culturing under “hardening” conditions or prefreezing
to an intermediate temperature prior to liquid nitrogen often are essential. The cell type
and time of sampling is also very important. For instance, there is a higher survival of
small, densely cytoplasmic cells in contrast to those that are highly vacuolated. In terms
of their stage in the cell cycle, cells in late lag and early exponential phase seem to survive
better. Cells in G1 reportedly have a better survival potential (Francis, 1992). Cell density,
freezing rate, thawing rate, and the nature and concentration of the cryoprotectants used
are also major considerations (Chmiel et a1., 1988; Grout, 1995). For purposes of
experimentation in Space, it would be preferable (as has already been emphasized) to
have as direct a regeneration as possible.

The logical conclusion from all the above is that, despite promising developments,
the requirements for cryopreservation via vitrification are still demanding and it is not

apparent whether procedures can be readily automated or whether there is a potential to
simplify the process for use during or at the end of a Space experiment. Cryopreservation
by vitrification needs to be carefully followed so that significant new developments are
quickly recognized and appreciated for what they are worth vis-a-vis their potential for
incorporation into management schemes for Space biology cell culture experiments. It
may well turn out that an adaptation of the process or “intermediate” procedure in which
the principle of vitrification is capitalized upon but liquid nitrogen is avoided may provide
a valuable avenue for investigation.

D. CHILLING OR LOW TEMPERATURE FOR MINIMAL— OR
ZERO-GROWTH MAINTENANCE

Attention will now be focused on chilling vs. freezing (see Graham & Patterson, 1982;
Grout & Morris, 1987). Brauner and Hager (1958) showed that the gravitropic stimulus
to roots could be “stored” in 3-4-day-old sunﬂower seedlings for some 12 hours at 4°C
and that the stimulus is expressed as soon as the material is exposed to room temperature
(ca. 20°C). Respiratory intensity is diminished considerably by lowering of temperature.
A rule of thumb seems to be lowering of temperature by 10°C lowers respiratory intensity
by about 2.5 times(see, e.g., Burzo, 1980). In 1974, Krikorian initiated studies aimed at
managing embryogenic cells of wild carrot, or Queen Anne’s lace (Daucus carota subsp.
carota), for an experiment destined to be carried out in November 1975 on the Soviet
biosatellite Cosmos 782 (see Krikorian & Steward, 1978, 1979; Krikorian, 1991). Em-
bryogenic cells, When distributed in a nutrient medium made semi-solid with 1% agar and
distributed in small (50 mm diam.) plastic petri dishes, were able to withstand 4°C :t 2°C
for well over a month with virtually no progression in development. Representative plated
carrot cells that were pretreated at 4°C for 0, 7, 14, 21, and 28 days in darkness in a
refrigerated incubator and subsequently removed to 22°C for evaluation of subsequent
growth and development for the same duration (i.e., 7, 14, 21, and 28 days) are shown in
Figure 5. The low temperature did not interfere with the ability of the cells to continue
development when they were transferred to the permissive temperature (Steward &
Krikorian, 1978). Carrot is, of course, a biennial species and its cells, even in the in vitro
state, might well be expected to tolerate cold temperatures better than cells of some other
plants (see Dix & Street, 1976; Dix, 1977, 1979). Also, resumption of development from
embryogenic initial cells curtailed in their progression of growth was at the beginning of
the experiment cycle. There is less certainty whether somatic embryos maintained in the
cold during the experiment or at the end would have necessarily behaved in a similar
fashion. Genetic propensity to adapt to cold (Graham & Patterson, 1982; Thomashow et
al., 1990; Thomashow, 1994) and the level of prior development will inﬂuence the ability
to tolerate exposure to cold, and would be expected to be related to the dimensions of the
units or structures in question. Younger, less developed, and hence more vulnerable
materials are the most sensitive; those more advanced would be more tolerant (Krikorian
& Weidenfeld, unpubl.).

The idea of using low temperature for minimal-growth storage of organs has been
exploited with various but generally morphologically fully developed in vitro systems
such as stem tips for some time (Westcott, 1981; Withers, 1983; Englemann, 1991; Kartha
& Englemann, 1994, and references cited therein). Even here, in each of the instances
studied, the level of efficiency has been highly variable and survival has in some cases
been very poor. Even in good cases, recovery has never been anywhere near complete,

is subsequently reversed at higher temperature (22°C). The crop of somatic embryos shown on each
dish was the outcome of the number of days in the cold, as indicated by the vertiéal scales at the left,
followed by the number of days at warmer temperanue, shown on the horizontal scale. Note that a

and in many cases the growth in vitro has been only retarded. However, in those cases
where recovery has been followed and evaluation made after growth in the ﬁeld, the
indication is that this kind of conservation effort has promise despite its lack of universal
applicability.

In the case of minimal-growth storage with undifferentiated callus tissues, Hiraoka
and Kodama (1982) showed that the ability to produce secondary metabolites was not
altered in most of their tissue culture strains tested for growth and biosynthetic potential
after storage for up to 6 months in an ordinary refrigerator at 4°C :1: 3°C. While recovery
and biochemical fidelity was often excellent in many cases, Hiraoka and Kodama (1982)
concluded that “the ability of callus to tolerate low temperature depends highly on a callus

strain.” Also of interest is that these workers were able to achieve rooting in a culture of
Bupleurum, an umbellifer that ordinarily would have lost capacity to regenerate roots after
a few passages.

For the German Spacelab mission (so-called D-l mission on Space Transport
System-61A, October 1985), Theimer et a1. (1986) were able, like Krikorian and
Steward (1978), to utilize low temperature to maintain their embryogenic cell cultures
of anise (Pimpinella anisum), a biennial member of the Umbelliferae, in a quiescent
state. Cells from sieved and washed suspensions were distributed onto sterile filter
paper soaked with nutrient medium, and the whole was placed on a medium made
semi-solid with 0.7% w/v agar. Cultures were chilled to 6°C in a “cooling box” and
stored in a mid-deck locker in the Space Shuttle, and removed for exposure to u-G at
26°C to activate the experiment.

Chilling was also used in the D-1 mission to retard the growth of the protozoan
Paramecium tetraaurelia (Richoilley et a1., 1986, 1988). Cultures were kept at 9°C and
then exposed to 22°C 1 05°C in the European Space Agency (ESA) “Biorack incuba-
tor.” Their experimental protocol involved using a plastic-bag culture apparatus to
grow paramecia in 0.65 ml liquid medium samples. Although their experimental
procedures called for fixation of the material, no specific mention was made of the
ability to recover live material from the ﬂight. Even so, it may be understood that the
low temperature had no adverse effects on the paramecium cultures, compared to
growth data for ground controls (Richoilley et a1., 1986: fig. 2). For their so-called
Cytos 1 experiment which was set up in Moscow, chilled and ﬂown to the Baikonour
launch site, launched and transferred to Soyuz 27, and maintained until Soyuz—Salyut
6 docking in Space, these same workers (Planel et a1., 1990) used a low temperature
of 8°C to halt growth prior to exposure to a permissive growth environment in Space
of 25°C i O.1°C. While the precise duration of chilling was not reported, I estimate
that it was on the order of about a week.

Chilling the slime mold Physarum polycephalum was also studied from the perspective
of experiment management for the D-1 mission. Development of plasmodia was stopped
by slow cooling to 6°C; 14 hours before ﬂight, the cultures were stored in a so-called
pas sive thermal control unit (PTCU). The experiment was activated in ﬂight on the fourth
day by placing cultures in the Biorack incubator at 22°C. Earlier investigations on Earth
had shown that the effects of rapidly changing temperature (14° to 30°C at intervals of 2°
per minute or so) on plasmodial contraction were completely reversible when contraction
frequency was at least between 10° and 28°C (Wohlfarth-Bottermann, 1977). Anomogram
provided by Block et a1. (1988: fig. 10) emphasizes how important it is in the case of
Physarum to have precise control over the temperature if one is to achieve minimal
adverse effect on level of survival. Also, Block et a1. (1988: 65) point out that “the samples
had been stored in the Biorack cooler, some parts of which also had temperatures slightly
below 4°C. . . . This was close to the time-temperature limit for survival for Physarum,
[and] only a few plasmodia survived this treatment. . . . For the planned . . . Biorack II,
a rea15°C PTCU will be provided to overcome the difficulties with the storage tempera-
ture.” One can anticipate that cultured higher plant cells will show the same kinds of
sensitivity to temperature excursions. The more closely controlled the temperature, the
better.

Finally, it may be recalled that protoplasts were chilled as part of a management
strategy for Space experimentation by Iversen and co-workers (see Rasmussen et a1.,
1990). Clearly, chilling offers considerable opportunity to manage plant cell and tissue

cultures and other organisms. In some instances it is simple and straightforward and can
be performed at a single reduced temperature level; in other cases a ﬂuctuating regime of
various low temperatures seems to be useful or even required. In still others, lowered
temperature is more of a problem. This emphasizes that while chilling affords consider-
able opportunity to stop or dramatically slow down growth, this must be closely tied to
the biology of the system. It follows that any engineering of hardware associated with
chilling must be precise enough to maintain temperature tolerances within specified
limits.

VI. Sub-Optimal Oxygen Strategies
A. REDUCED OXYGEN

Unlike the extensive literature that applies to microorganisms (Onken & Liefke,
1989; Levett, 1991 ), there is much less detailed documentation that aeration rates affect
growth of plant cells in suspension (e.g., see Steward & Bidwell, 1958; Ammirato,
1983; De-Eknamkul & Ellis, 1984; Hegarty et a1., 1986; Chen et a1., 1987; Snape et
a1., 1989; Tate & Payne, 1991; Gao & Lee, 1992; Jay et a1., 1992; Schlatmann et a1.,
1994; Schripsema & Verpoorte, 1995). Cultured cells generally seem to profit by
elevated oxygen tensions and hence respond adversely to oxygen limitation by not
growing; this tendency could perhaps be developed in special cases as a means of
conserving cells (Mitz, 1979; Bridgen & Staby, 1981; Furuya et a1., 1984; Forster &
Estabrook, 1993). Altered aeration has considerable impact on secondary metabolism
(DiCosmo & Towers, 1983). But as has been emphasized, the single most important
objective of conserving plant cells in culture in Space and their subsequent return to
Earth is to be able to examine them in as unperturbed a metabolic and morphological
state as possible. Significant metabolic changes are sure to occur in cells when the
gaseous environment is changed (see Bullough, 1952; Stiles, 1960; Hook & Crawford,
1978; Snape et a1., 1989; Jackson et a1., 1991; Pell & Steffen, 1991; Gao & Lee, 1992;
Crawford, 1992; Lambers & van der Plas, 1992), although in some cases, such as
breaking bud dormancy and germination of certain species, there are beneficial effects
of anoxia or severe hypoxia, i.e., less than 1—2% oxygen (see come et a1., 1991). Thus,
any strategy that uses gaseous oxygen deprivation alone as a way to manage cells for
zero- or minimal-growth maintenance, especially at the endvof an experiment, needs to
be carefully considered for its ability to effect unwanted change (van’t Hof, 1970;
Prince, 1989).

Even modification of the ambient gaseous environment with regard to low tempera-
ture storage of fruits such as apples is linked with delaying senescence and the onset
of the climacteric and hence does not seem relevant here. This is especially so since
even in the case of intact organs and plant parts with well-formed epidermis and cuticle
there are many potentially undesirable effects and physiological “disorders” and
consequences due to modification but incomplete suppression of the respiratory rate
via change in the ambient gaseous environment. (For a historical treatment of the use
of gases in the storage of fruit, especially apples, see Smock, 1970; also Kader, for a
physiological treatment of postharvest biology, see Kader, 1986, 1992; for a discussion
of modified atmosphere packaging of horticultural commodities, see Prince, 1989.) In
the case of aseptically cultured cells and tissues with minimally developed or totally
absent epidermis, the gaseous relationships become even more difficult to control and
assess.

"28","CELL CULTURE IN MICROGRAVITY 67
It will be seen below (“Mineral Oil Preservation or Inactivation of Cultured Plant
Cells”), however, that the principle of reduced oxygen plays a role but is generally most
effective when coupled with decreased temperature. Also, there is some indication that
low oxygen partial pressures have potential value for stem tip conservation (Bridgen &
Staby, 1981), but very little is known about the mechanism of action or its effects on
metabolism of cells (Jamieson, 1980a, 1980b; Andre & Richard, 1986; Calderon &
Barkai-Golan, 1990). *

For our purposes, then, it may be argued that no special efforts should be made to
investigate the direct use of reduced gaseous oxygen as a means to conserve plant cell
cultures. Attention will, of necessity, be paid to gaseous environment when specifications
for oxygenation or aeration are stipulated (Hulst et al., 1985; Prince, 1989; Prince et al.,
1991).

B. MINERAL OIL PRESERVATION OR INACTIVATION OF CULTURED PLANT CELLS

The use of mineral oil (parafﬁn oil) as an overlay on agar slants of fungi as a means
of slowing down growth and preventing desiccation has, over the years, been reported to
be successful in a number of species. With the availability of lyophilization and cryopre-
servation, mineral oil overlay has faded out of the picture fully in terms of microorgan-
isms. The technique of mineral oil overlay is said to have originated in 1918 with
Ungermann, who initiated conservation of pathogenic bacterial cultures in dilute sera by
covering them with a layer of mineral oil. The method was extended to semi-solid media
by Michael in 1921 (see Morton & Pulaski, 1938, for references and a list of 45 diverse
bacterial cultures so conserved for long periods). Sherf (1943) used the technique on
filamentous fungi and was able to keep Fusarium and Alternaria without losing their
pathogenicity for 6 months and even longer. Buell & Weston (1947) provided a compre—
hensive summary of mineral oil conservation work carried out on an extensive and diverse
(some 1800 species) “Tropical Fungus Culture Collection” at the Harvard Biological
Laboratories, isolated in connection with the study of “trOpical deterioration” of Quarter-
master Corps materiel during World War II.

The mineral oil technique offers a significant advantage in that it is simple and
“low-tech,” and hence should be relatively straightforward to implement. Fungal material
to be conserved, especially non-sporulating mycelia, is ﬁrst grown on an appropriate
nutrient medium agar slant, and then heavy mineral oil is applied. Buell and Weston
( 1947) state “Parke-Davis’ heavy mineral oil of exceptional purity, high Saybolt viscosity
of not less than 330 at 100°F [38°C] and speciﬁc gravity around 0.8—0.9, autoclaved for
45 min in half-filled 250 ml cotton plugged Erlenmeyer ﬂasks is applied.” (They also
point out that hot air is acceptable for sterilization: 150°C for 1.5 hours.) These authors
note that the oil was “often cloudy as a result of moisture vapor accumulated during
autoclaving but was easily cleared either by letting the ﬂasks stand for 1-2 days, or by
heating them for a few minutes over an electric stove.” The work of Buell and Weston
(1947) emphasized that “if the organism is submerged under too deep a layer of oil, it
may be smothered. Therefore, it is most important that the oil be poured in to a depth of
about 1 cm above the tip of the slant.” Successful storage for a couple of years was not

uncommon under these conditions. The mineral oil method was also tested at Harvard by
J. T. Bonner on the slime mold Dictyostelium discoideum, an organism said to proﬁt by
frequent transfers; cultures were able to last some 12 months and yielded vigorous
cultures. Similarly, Blakeslea trispora, another Phycomycete and reputedly a very fastidi-

ous organism, remained viable and could be conserved under oil for 10 months; material
that had been kept 12-16 months did not survive, however (Buell & Weston, 1947).

It is signiﬁcant that each of these workers emphasized that no undesirable modiﬁca-
tions were encountered on subculture and that all cultures gave typical, vigorous devel-
opment and sporulation. It is also significant that they kept the oil-overlaid culture
“upright at room temperature or preferably at about 10°C.” Unfortunately, no data were
provided as to the advantage of using cold in combination with the mineral oil overlay,
but one can see that this could offer an effective strategy for dealing with our problem of
conserving cell and tissue cultures in Space.

Recovery of the culture to a subculturable mode is merely stated as having been
achieved by pouring off the oil. Sherf (1943) made a special point of mentioning that
“before streaking, the loop was held against the inside wall of the test tube above the agar
to remove much of the oil adhering to the cells.”

Edwards et a1. (1947) showed that the oxygen consumption of a fungus culture
submerged under 1 cm oil mineral oil “was about 10% of normal within a few hours, and
thereafter declines very gradually over a period of many months.” These authors empha-
sized that the mineral oil not only prevented the evaporation of water from the agar
medium but also served to reduce the supply of available oxygen to the culture, thus
reducing the respiratory rate and bringing about a retardation of growth. Also, staling
products, “ordinarily increasingly harmful as a culture ages, will accumulate less rapidly
and it seems probable that when formed, they will not oxidize so quickly or to the degree
that they would in the usual type of culture.”

Table IV provides solubility data for carbon dioxide, oxygen, and nitrogen in extra-
heavy (specific gravity 0890—0895 at 15°C), white medicinal mineral oil (United States
Pharmacopoeia, U.S.P. grade) (Kubie, 1927). Even though the values are low, they are
considerably higher than might have been guessed. Kubie (1927) pointed out that the slow
rate of diffusion of carbon dioxide through mineral oil when it is saturated with 1
atmosphere of carbon dioxide, and presumably the rate of diffusion of the other gases, is
the main cause of the “protective virtue” of the oil when it is used to separate a
physiological fluid from air.

Rodnight (1954) gives the solubility of oxygen at S.T.P. in heavy mineral oil (sp. gr.
0.835) at 38°C as 0.098 i 0.0017. Since higher plant cells are normally grown at lower
temperatures (say 20—28°C), the solubilities that concern us are closer to the values given
by Kubie (1927).

Caplin (1959) reported being able to conserve cultures derived from secondary
phloem carrot root grown on semi-solid White’s nutrient medium at 26°C i- 1°C using
heavy U.S.P. grade mineral oil in amounts ranging from about 4 mm depth to 45 mm
depth. Subsequent ability to grow after prolonged submersion under oil of some 3-5
months was not adversely affected. In fact, growth under mineral oil was better than
growth under ordinary liquid nutrient medium superimposed on callus tissues grown on
an agar medium. Caplin (1959) was also able to show that growth of tissue under mineral
oil could reach levels equivalent to controls in air, provided the oxygen supply over the
mineral oil was enhanced by flushing with 100% oxygen. Because the volume of dry
oxygen that can dissolve in water under standard pressure and a temperature of 26°C is
0.028 (about 4 times the solubility of oxygen in water), Caplin (1959) concluded that the
reason for better growth of cultures under mineral oil than under stationary liquid nutrient
medium was the oxygenation. Caplin (1959) states that some 30 “strains” of plant tissue
culture had been “maintained in the laboratory under mineral oil, subcultured at intervals

Caplin (1959) also reported that light mineral oil was as good as heavy mineral oil.
Liquid petrolatum, known as heavy liquid petrolatum, liquid paraffin, white mineral oil
(U.S.P. grade) has a specific gravity of not less than 0.860 and not more than 0.905. Its
kinematic viscosity is not less than 38.1 centistokes at 37.8°C. Light mineral oil or light
liquid paraffin, on the other hand, is supposed to have a kinematic viscosity of not more
than 37 centistokes at 37.8°C and a speciﬁc gravity between 0.828 and 0.880. Otherwise,
both materials are nominally identical and either may contain 10 mg/l (10 ppm) of
a—tocopherol as a stabilizing agent. Both are listed in the Sigma catalog: Heavy white oil,
Cat. Number 400-5, is listed as having a viscosity of 340—360 Saybolt Universal seconds
and density of 0.88 gm/ml; the light white oil, “suitable for nujol mulls for infrared
spectroscopy,” Cat. Number M 3516, has a density of 0.84 gm/ml. These values are
emphasized since if in a given situation it turns out that the light mineral oil is equivalent
to the heavy in effectiveness for plant cells and tissues, then its more fluid qualities could
be advantageous, e.g., for addition or removal of oil or for pumping oil through narrow-
diameter tubing, etc.

It is significant that more recently, some investigators interested in in vitro conserva-
tion have noted the great potential of mineral oil overlay in low-tech situations (Engle-
mann, 1991; Constabel & Shyluk, 1994). Augereau et a1. (1986) have also carried out
more recent studies with mineral oil overlay using a range of germplasm. While they are
strong advocates of the mineral oil method, they noted that tissues under oil could show
higher chlorophyll content than controls showed. They offer the hypothesis that “the
carbon dioxide released during fermentation accumulates on the callus surface transfer
of C02 through oil is very slow. Some small bubbles can be observed on the callus surface,
it is probably C02 accumulation and it could induce and/or increase photosynthetic
activity. The absence of 02 forbids direct use of the sucrose present in the media.
Therefore, photosynthetic activity induced by C02 accumulation produced by a sugar
fermentation allows the growth.”

VII. Constraining Gels '

Interest in producing commercially valuable secondary plant products or metabolites
in bioreactors has fostered research on entrapment or immobilization of cultured cells in
constraining gels of various sorts. The fact is that the whole field of evoking tissue or
organ-speciﬁc biosyntheses in vitro is fraught with many difficulties (cf., e.g., Weber et

al., 1992; Schripsema & Verpoorte, 1995) and few systems have proven themselves
economically viable. [It should be pointed out at the outset that few details are available
on the effects of immobilization on plant cell cycle kinetics and metabolism (see Cabral
et al., 1983; Brodelius, 1983a, 1983b, 1985, 1988; Hulst etal., 1985; Rhodes, 1985; Webb
et al., 1986; Rosevear & Lambe, 1985, 1986; Constabel & Vasil, 1987; Mavituna et al.,
1987; Robins & Rhodes, 1988; Chmiel et al., 1988; Charlwood & Rhodes, 1990; Karel
et al., 1990; Tabata, 1991; Christen & Gibson, 1987; Furusaki & Seki, 1992; Kutney, 1993;
Constabel & Tyler, 1994).]

It has been suggested that entrapment in and of itself imposes physical stress on plant
cells and this in turn fosters secondary product synthesis and excretion (Fukui et al., 1983;
Rhodes, 1985; Ketel et al., 1987 ; Bn'ngi & Schuler, 1990; Hahn-Hagerdahl, 1990; Hamer,
1990). It is in this context of stimulating production that would otherwise not occur or
would occur to a lesser extent than desired that investigators have sought to use immobi-
lized cells (Fowler, 1987; Doran, 1993)! Various cell immobilization technologies hold
some promise for our objectives (Brodelius, 1983a, 1983b, 1985, 1988; Schuler et al.,
1983; Fink et al., 1983; Mattiasson, 1983; Prenosil & Pedersen, 1983; Rosevear & Lambe,
1985, 1986; Lindsey & Yeoman, 1985, 1986; Yeoman, 1987; Christen & Gibson, 1987;
Bramble et al., 1990; Lambie, 1990; Scragg, 1990; Yeoman et al., 1990; Furusaki & Seki,
1992).

Lambie (1990: 270—271) provides a succinct summary of this area of research and
draws attention to the advantages and disadvantages of immobilization or entrapment,
especially from the perspective of handling cells that produce secondary products in
bioreactors: “Three methods of entrapment have been described: (1) the cells may be
entrapped on films or webs of material; (2) the cells may be entrapped in gels.”

I will interrupt here with a quote from Brodelius (1985: 32) on the three basic
categories of gel-forming entrapment procedures: “Gel formation by ionic cross-linking
of a charged polymer. Gel formation by cooling of a heated polymer. Gel formation by
chemical reactions. Alginate is an example of the first, agarose and agar of the second,
and gelatin (cross linked with glutaraldehyde) and polyacrylamide of the third group.
Carrageenan is a combination of the first and second groups. Up to at least 50% wet weight
of plant cells can be readily immobilized in these various gels.”

Continuing from Lambie (1990):

(3) the cells may be entrapped in porous or three-dimensional reticulates, e.g. like

the material used for pan scrubbers. The entrapment of cells on webs or films results

in low cell density in the reactor. Moreover, the cells may be easily detached. The

second method has been used most widely, namely entrapping the plant cells in gel

beads. The gels used include agar, agarose, gelatin, carrageenan, alginate, and
polyacrylamide: alginate is the most widely used. However, these beads lack physi-

cal strength, they may be weakened by substances in the nutrient medium, e.g.

phosphate will cause calcium alginate gels to break down. Methods of achieving the
desirable strength with synthetic polymers usually adversely affect the viability of
the plant cells therein. Moreover, owing to the encapsulation of the cells by the gel,
transport problems frequently arise. Finally continued growth results in cells grow-
ing out and becoming detached whereupon they may lodge in other parts of the
system, grow and cause blockages. The most effective method is the entrapment of
the cells in a three-dimensional reticulate e.g. plastic foam, pan scrubbers, and steel
knit mesh are examples of such reticulates. The application of this technique is

reviewed by Yeoman (1987). Once cells are lodged in the voids of the reticulates
they may multiply until the aggregate is entrapped.

A key point for us is that, while there are the above-mentioned and unmentioned
problems, the “problems” of those seeking to use immobilized cells as systems to promote
biosynthesis might be the means for us to solve our objectives. For instance, cell growth
is generally diminished after entrapment or immobilization. It has been stated that “when
immobilized, the cells can only exhibit properties which are inherent within them;
immobilization merely provides a convenient method of exploiting these [biosynthetic]
properties. Furthermore, although the immobilization process may seriously stress the
cell, subsequent productivity and longevity are more likely to be features of the cell itself
rather than the immobilization method used. The latter simply affects the number of viable
cells and the ease with which they can be manipulated and is of little consequence if the
chosen cell line selected is unstable or genetically unsuitable for high productivity”
(Rosevear & Lambe, 1985: 44).

This suggests that immobilization per se has high potential to slow down plant cell
growth and that there is minimal perturbation on its biochemical potential. Coupled with
reduced temperature, this could offer substantial opportunities for long-term storage.
Indeed, there is much literature that indicates that relatively extended storage of even very
delicate cells such as protoplasts can be achieved without adverse effects on morphology
or physiology. For example, using stomatal guard cell protoplasts of fava bean (Vzcia
faba), Schnabl et a1. (1980) were able to show that calcium alginate—entrapped “cells”
retained their spherical shape over a period of 14 days and kept their ability to show
appropriate osmotic properties typical of guard cells. These authors further point out that
“immobilized guard cell protoplasts can be sent over long distances by train without any
apparent changes in morphology, membrane integrity, or cellular functions. . . . Thus, it
is obvious that stomata protoplasts which are otherwise very fragile and cannot be
transported in suspension can be subjected to transportation using this technique”
(Schnabl et al., 1980: 282; see also Schnabl et al., 1983).

It was mentioned early in the context of immobilization that one can utilize a number
of kinds of entrapment gels (for a discussion of various structural and mechanical
properties of various polymer gels, see Clark & Ross-Murphy, 1987; Skjak-Brwk &
Martinsen, 1991); each of these has advantages and disadvantages (Cabral et al., 1983;
Rhodes, 1985). Even protein gels such as gelatin may have a place (Ziegler & Foegeding,
1990). Much work suggests that calcium alginate offers a number of advantages (Draget
et al., 1988). The alginate can be dissolved in calcium chelating agents such as ethyle-
nediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA), polyphosphate, or citrate. It is a relatively mild
process. Also, agarase(s) can be used to collapse gels noninvasively (Yaphe, 1957;
Craigie, 1991); the same is true of alginase (Williams & Eagon, 1962). Sodium alginate
can be sterilized by autoclaving, and, depending on the grade and composition of alginate
used and how concentrated it is (say 4% w/v), it is quite viscous but still should be
pourable and hence can be “dispensed” into a sterile solution of, say, ca. 0.2 M calcium
chloride. The advantage here would be that the material intended as the immobilizing gel
could be presterilized by autoclaving or preferably by filter sterilization and “stored”
ready for use once cells were placed in it.

One potentially significant physiological/cell biological/biochemical problem is that
the procedure of entrapment or immobilization in alginate gel involves the use of calcium
chloride. Rosevear and Lambe (1985: 45) write: “Cells are suspended in a solution of

sodium alginate which is then extruded through a defined orifice using either a pump or
dropping pipette. The resulting droplets are gelled on contact with a solution of calcium
chloride (50—100 mM) which can be made up in a nutrient medium to minimize shock to
the cells. The viscosity of the alginate limits the practical range of polymer to concentra-
tions to 2 to 3%, although it should be noted that autoclave sterilization permanently
reduces the viscosity of alginate solutions. The alginate gels can be formed with many
di-valent and polyvalent cations and a number of microbial cells have been immobilized
in aluminum, and barium alginate. The toxicity of some metal ions causes some problems
with plant cells. Since calcium is a constituent of nutrient media it will inevitably replace
any other ion in time and so is routinely chosen for most purposes.” (Ammonium alginate
is not readily available through chemical supply houses, but it has its usefulness as well.)

Rosevear & Lambe (1985) point out that “an outer skin of gel forms around the droplet
immediately upon entering the salt solution giving a clean, well defined bead. However,
complete gelation takes several minutes, particularly with the dilute solutions being used
to minimize osmotic shock. The cells are evenly distributed in the gel.”

In connection with discussing problems with the alginate gel methods, Rosevear and
Lambe (1985: 45 et seq.) go on to state that a “major problem with this technique is
associated with the metal ion used for cross-linking. Calcium ions can be important
triggers of many biological mechanisms, and are known to affect celllcell adhesion in
plant systems” (see, e.g., Jansen et a1., 1990; Marchant et a1., 1993). They conclude,
however, that “despite these limitations, the calcium alginate gel remains the simplest and
most popular method of immobilization, particularly for short term studies.”

Tamponnet (1986) pays considerable attention to the use of entrapment gels for
Euglena gracilis. Entrapment in alginate coupled with refrigerator cold temperatures is
now routinely used in many laboratories for storing Euglena lines (Leland Edmunds, pers.
comm). One consideration for us in the context of growing plant cells in a cell culture
unit of one sort or another (and that may not be very serious) is that sterilization is needed
for all these carrier gels. Provision will need to be made to keep materials sterile and in
solution until needed, i.e., during or at the end of the experiment.

Table V lists advantages and disadvantages of various immobilization matrices for
plant cells in the context of a “cell culture apparatus” or whatever one chooses to call it,
of hypothetical design.

The emphasis is on agar/agarose, but even ammonium alginate (which is likely to be
less toxic) is mentioned, as is gelatin.

Of special significance in the context of Table V is that “no agent added,” i.e., liquid
culture, puts investigators at a tremendous disadvantage, especially over the longer term,
since cells in liquid are likely to be relatively unprotected and vulnerable to significant
damage. It is, of course, for this reason that appropriate strategies such as immobilization
need to be identified and developed for use. While the use of “constraining gels” or
“matrices” is emphasized here, other strategies such as use of liquid “anti-freezes,” even
though it is probably premature to mention them here, should not be overlooked.

In its brevity, Table V seeks to cut through the details of procedures used and methods
adopted in various laboratory studies by the author and in the literature.

Two points must be made. First of all, no single matrix will accommodate all, or even
a wide range of, plant cells. Each individual system that an investigator seeks to use will
probably have to be worked out in detail. Nevertheless, it is hoped that future work and
reduction of findings will allow common ground for a wider range of cells and species
than currently seems possible.

"37","76 THE BOTANICAL REVIEW

Second, one will need to have a relatively wide and precisely maintained temperature
range from at least as low as 4°C and perhaps a bit lower. A higher temperature limit for
“cooling” might end up being 15-17°, even up to 20°C. Upper limits of temperature for
growing will probably be represented by 28°C, but 22°C will probably be the preferred
growing temperature for many cell types.

Clearly there is high potential for the use of immobilization using entrapment gels.
Before one gets too optimistic about the use of this method for unorganized cell cultures,
however, it will be important to perform studies to determine the ease with which the
procedures are amenable to use in the context of a cell culture unit destined for use in
Space. There seems to be more optimism for use of the system with embryogenic cell
cultures but even here similar problems obtain. In any case, entrapment per se does not
stop growth but may retard it significantly. Also, depending on a number of factors such
as the temperature at which the entrapment gels are used, further curtailment of growth
is possible. Combined use of this entrapment technology in combination with low
temperature may well afford opportunities for cell culture management that either one by
itself cannot achieve fully.

B. SYNTHETIC “SEEDS”

The concept of synthetic “seeds,” comprising encapsulated somatic embryos or
minute shoot buds, has attracted considerable interest in the plant biotechnology
industry (Gray & Purohit, 1991; Redenbaugh, 1993). Desiccated coated and uncoated
somatic embryos, or somatic embryos in ﬂuid gels, are the basis of this developing
technology (see Redenbaugh, 1993, and references cited therein). While the emphasis
has been on encapsulation of mature somatic embryos, clearly the principles have
significance for our objectives using cells. Indeed, if the objective of a given plant cell
culture experiment is the study of u-G or other space-flight factors on the development
of somatic embryos, this technology could have direct application. Nevertheless, as in
the case of entrapment or immobilization, this specialized approach will require
development.

VIII. Critical Osmotic Adjustment
A. USE OF “NON-METABOLIZED” OSMOTICA

There is a large literature on the use of osmotic agents in the preparation and recovery
of protoplasts (see Fitter & Krikorian, 1983; Dalton & MacKenzie, 1987; Nishimura et
al., 1987; Roest & Gilissen, 1989; Power et al., 1989; Bajaj, 1994, and references cited
therein), and, there has been substantial experience in osmotic adjustment in connection
with vitrification procedures. Osmotic agents like sucrose (Torrey & Galun, 1970; Michel,
1972), mannitol (Trip et al., 1964; Jackson, 1965; Brown et al., 1979; Litz, 1986;
Roberts-Oehlschlager & Dunwell, 1990), sorbitol (Chong & Taper, 1972, 1974; Ahmad
et al., 1979; Pua & Chong, 1985; Kavikishor & Reddy, 1986; Reuveni et al., 1991; Leva
& Muleo, 1993), melibiose (Dracup et al., 1986), inositol (Lin & Staba, 1961; Loewus,
1990; Durzan, 1987), polyethylene glycol (Jackson, 1962; Michel, 1970, 1972; Michel &
Kaufmann, 1973; Basra et al., 1988), and glycine-betaine (Wyn Jones, 1984) have been
used as osmotica and to retard plant cell growth (e.g., see Michel, 1970, 1972; Brown et
al., 1979) or to inhibit metabolism (Jones, 1969; Cress, 1982). Osmotic increase to retard

growth is only one aspect of the strategy that leads to preservation (Stiles, 1960; Crafts,
1968; Crowe & Clegg, 1973).

The other aspect is that osmotic level may be maintained by adding nominally inert
osmotica (for example, partially or fully replacing sucrose with sorbitol or melibiose)
to lower availability of carbon substrate for metabolism and growth. Partial or full
replacement of sucrose with sorbitol has been used with a number of cell cultures and
been part of management schemes for embryogenic carrot cells in this laboratory for
some time (Ammirato & Steward, 1971; Steward et al., 1975). It is significant,
however, that these nominally poorly metabolized sugar alcohols may be less inert than
supposed (e.g., see Dracup et al., 1986; Thompson & Douglas, 1986; Einspahr &
Thompson, 1990; Loewus, 1990; Stoop et al., 1995). In any case, manipulating osmotic
relations will inevitably play a role in cell culture technology either alone or in
connection with vitrification procedures.

B. NUTRIENT STARVATION

This category could well have been set up as a distinct method or even included in
section X (“Growth-Retarding Compounds”), but since it is not being advocated as a
strategy of choice, it is being subsumed under the general discussion of nutrient with-
drawal or the strategy of replacing important nutrients such as sugars with largely
metabolically inert sugar alcohols, etc. Withdrawal of sucrose from a growing system can
reduce cell proliferation dramatically (van’t Hof, 1966). The entire field of plant nutrition
has been geared to the effects of deficiencies on plant growth, development, and metabo-
lism (Amino et al., 1983; Thomas & Grierson, 1987; Sauerbeck & Helal, 1990; Dunlop
& Curtis, 1991; Kabata-Pendias & Pendias, 1992; Marchner, 1994). Use of such things
as nitrogen and phosphate limitation has been studied from the perspective of effects on
secondary metabolism (Gershenzon, 1983; Mizrahi, 1988; Dunlop & Curtis, 1991; Schlat-
mann et al., 1994, and references cited therein). There may be special circumstances in
which critical lowering or depletion of a particular nutrient might be useful for cell culture
management. There is a considerable variety of organic acids that interfere with growth
of cultures (Hildebrandt & Riker, 1949). Several amino acids that inhibit growth are
known as well (Riker & Gutsche, 1948; Steward et al., 1958).

The best-studied of the amino acid type-inhibiting agents is perhaps hydroxyproline
(Steward et al., 1958; Varner, 1987 ; Showalter & Rumeau, 1990; Robinson et al., 1990;
Basile, 1990; Basile & Basile, 1990). An example of its dramatic ability to retard growth
may be drawn from its action on excised maize embryos. Barrales (1959) showed that
hydroxyproline at 200 mg/l was sufficient to cause severe curtailment of growth but 100
mg/l of proline could reverse the inhibition. Any slight growth that occurred in the
presence of hydroxyproline was attributed to endogenous levels of proline; when the pools
were used up, the inhibition by hydroxyproline was complete. The inhibition of growth
by hydroxyproline and its reversal by proline are common features that apply to carrot
explants (Steward & Pollard, 1958; Steward et al., 1958) and Zea embryos (Barrales,
1959). The fungus Trichophyton also shows this inhibition (Robbins & McVeigh, 1946).
Ethionine and mercaptoethanol interfere with growth as well (Longevialle, 1970); meth—
ionine is a good antagonist to ethionine.

For the same objections raised above in the discussion of oxygen starvation, it seems
that this is not the preferred option for storage of cells at the end of an experiment. It
might, however, have value prior to the initiation of an experiment where growth has been
kept to a minimum and “activation” occurs when replacement of limiting or inhibiting

nutrients is carried out (e.g., see Kanabus et a1., 1985; Amino & Tazawa, 1988; Hagen et
a1., 1991; Schnapp et al., 1991a, 1991b; Zhang & MacKown, 1992).
IX. Low pH
A. LOW pH AND MAINTENANCE OF EMBRYOGENIC CELLS

When embryogenic “cell” cultures are to be utilized, low pH offers significant
potential for management in a very specific yet signiﬁcant context. Work done in this
laboratory using cultivated carrot has shown that embryogenic cells can be kept in a state
of limited embryogenic development. The significance of this is that investigators might
wish to activate an experiment by elevating the pH to a level at which somatic embryo-
genesis can proceed. One could easily envision a scenario, for example, where embryo-
genic initials were kept in the nonadvancing mode, growing minimally at low pH to the
extent that more nonadvanced preglobular stage somatic embryos are being produced.
The medium would then be changed by elevating the pH a few units, which would lead
to a “permissive” mode. Since the developmentally nonadvanced somatic embryos (those
prevented from progressing in their development by the low pH) are clonal, one can be
assured the material represents a reasonable sample.

In this context, one could readily conceive of an experiment wherein the pH is kept
low from the outset of the setup; and, either alone or coupled with chilling, the
experiment could be carried out by elevating the temperature and changing the pH.
Some facts will be presented that should help a prospective investigator better to
understand the low pH system and to ascertain whether the strategy might serve that
investigator’s needs (Fig. 6).

Some facts of importance to us here:

(1) Somatic embryo development in carrot is prevented at an external medium pH of 4,
is severely reduced at pH 4.5, and occurs at a high level at pH 5.7.

(2) The first-formed somatic embryos always develop at least to the globular stage even
if the external medium pH is falling due to the presence of NH4+ as the sole nitrogen
source.

(3) The first-formed somatic embryos will continue development into later embryo
stages, without continued secondary embryo formation, if the medium pH is main-
tained above 4.5.

(4) The establishment of cultures consisting entirely of preglobular stage proembryos
(PGSPs) is a slow process. The first-formed somatic embryos multiply in the
beginning, as globular stage embryos, only when the pH of the medium is allowed
to fall during the culture period. During each successive culture period (each
2—3-week period), the volume per tissue mass made up of globular stage embryos
decreases while the volume of PGSPs increases. A total culture period of 2-3
months—i.e., 4—6 transfers of the entire tissue mass after the initiation of somatic
embryos—is required to establish a culture consisting entirely of PGSPs.

(5) Establishment of PGSPs can be hastened by repeated mashing or wounding of the
first-formed globular stage embryos at the time transfers are made.

(6) The growth rate of PGSPs maintained at pH 4 can be nearly doubled by the addition
of a synthetic auxin (i.e., 4.5 12M 2, 4-D).

(7) Transfer of cultures consisting of “undifferentiated” callus and PGSPs—initiated and
maintained in medium at pH 5.7 with the synthetic auxin 2,4-D—to hormone-free

somatic embryos (PGSPs)of cultivated carrot. PGSPs maintained and multiplied at pH 4 [1] continue
development into later embryo stages when grown on the same medium that has been buffered to pH 5

to the globular stage [3]. These in turn develop to the heart [4], torpedo [5], early [6] and late [7]
cotyledonary stage and thence to a plantlet. Subculture onto buffered low pH medium (pH 4.5) leads to
the establishment of a culture consisting exclusively of PGSPs [1]. Elevation of pH permits their
continued embryogenesis. After work of Smith and Krikorian (unpubl. scheme).

medium at pH 4 results in continued multiplication of PGSPs but not “undifferenti-
ated” callus.

(8) PGSPs cannot be maintained as such if the medium pH is maintained at or above 4.5.

(9) Once PGSPs have been allowed to develop to the globular stage by culture on
medium buffered above pH 4.5, 2—3 months’ time is again required to reestablish
PGSP cultures transferring the globular stage embryos back to a medium of lower
pH.

(10) Continued development of PGSPs requires a source of reduced nitrogen in the
medium. Ammonium at 1-5 mM is an excellent nitrogen source, whereas nitrate as
the sole nitrogen source will not support continued embryo development (Smith &
Krikorian, 1990a, 1990b, 1990c, 1991).

It remains to be tested whether lowering pH at the end of an experiment is sufficient
to maintain it at zero growth with minimal change in qualities and characteristics.

It is not understood why low external pH allows embryogenic carrot cells (PGSPs) to
multiply without development into later embryo stages on hormone-free medium. There
is no evidence from other plant systems to draw on that could directly suggest a
mechanism behind this low-pH phenomenon. There is, however, much information that
can be drawn on for indirect comparison. There is a growing number of reports that show
that challenge with low external pH, especially below 4.5, can lower the intracellular pH
of cultured plant cells. Also, several nonplant systems were observed to be influenced in
their morphology by changes in external pH; external pH changes probably exert control
indirectly via changes in internal pH (Minocha, 1987). Changes in intracellular pH occur
and are thought to influence the cell cycle, division, and growth (Busa & N uccitelli, 1984).
Particular attention has been placed on the pH changes occurring in the egg after
fertilization in many systems such as sea urchin (Lytechinus pictus) and frog (Xenopus
laevis) (Felle, 1989, and references cited therein).

Amoebae of Dictyostelium discoideum in the presence of cyclic AMP (CAMP) can
be directed to stalk formation in a medium at low pH, whereas spore formation is
favored on medium of higher pH (Town et al., 1987). Lowering of external medium
pH was shown to lower the intracellular pH, and the drop in intracellular pH was first
thought to direct the morphological changes (Van Lookeren Campagne et al., 1989).
However, it was found that an increased intracellular pH in the absence of CAMP did
not induce prespore gene expression. Furthermore, the presence of CAMP and blockage
of rise in intracellular pH does not inhibit expression of prespore genes. Van Lookeren
Campagne et a1. (1989) therefore postulated that the main function of cytoplasmic pH
change could be to provide or reduce substrate for H+-requiring enzymes. This
suggestion is supported by the fact that the major response to cytoplasmic acidification
is the activation of H+ ATPase (Felle, 1989). Therefore, acidification could provide the
substrate (H+) or biochemical conditions needed for conformational changes necessary
to activate/deactivate as-yet-undiscovered mechanisms. In fact, it has been shown that
in oat roots there is a plasma membrane—associated ATPase that is activated by phospho-
rylation via a calcium-stimulated pH-sensitive protein kinase (Schaller & Sussman, 1988).

Other systems in higher plants reﬂect morphological changes due to external pH
changes. An optimum pH of 5.4 was shown for somatic embryogenesis in carrot
(Wetherell & Dougall, 1976). That study, however, focused on the numbers of embryos
formed. At pH values below 4.5, PGSPs did not organize into later-stage embryos, and
this was interpreted as a poor response. Last, in cultures of the moss Bartramidula
bartramiodes it was shown that formation of gametangia, or organs in which the sex cells

are produced, did not occur in medium below pH 5 but did occur with increasing frequency
at pH levels up to 7 (Rahbar & Chopra, 1982).

Exogenously added auxins have been shown to affect intracellular pH most often
by lowering it (Felle, 1989), but in some cases the addition of auxins has resulted in
no detectable drop in intracellular pH (Kutschera & Schopfer, 1985). In these cases it
has been argued that localized pH changes may occur at the inner surface of the
plasmalemma especially if the result of added auxin is directed cell elongation
(Kurkjian & Guern, 1989). That reported differences are probably due to the develop-
mental and physiological states of the cells being examined has been stressed by
Kurkjian & Guern (1989). This idea is reinforced by observations that an external pH
of 4 blocks the initial formation of somatic embryos from wounded zygotic embryos,
whereas a pH of 4 then becomes critical for maintaining the PGSPs that were derived
from the first-formed somatic embryos. -

That external pH below 4.5 lowers the internal pH of PGSPs to a critical level, thus
yielding the response of continued multiplication without further development, seems
plausible. Therefore, several points on what a lowered internal pH does may be instruc-
tive. An external pH change of 1 pH unit has generally been shown to drop the internal
pH 0.1 unit (Kurkdjian & Guern, 1989).

The conclusion is that lowered pH may offer an avenue for cell culture management
in a context broader than has been hitherto anticipated. It seems reasonable to believe
that, provided the biology of the system is amenable to it, low pH can provide a tool
for cell culture management at the outset of an experiment in a cell culture unit. It is
not as likely that it will have major value by itself in the course of, or at the end of, an
experiment.

There seems to be a fair amount of evidence that major metabolic changes are
effected when pH is changed. This probably means little at the outset of an experiment.
Nevertheless, one should test whether lowering pH at the end of an embryogenesis
experiment is able to maintain cells at zero growth with minimal change in qualities
and characteristics, i.e., with no significant change insofar as capacity for later devel-
opment into plantlets is concerned. In short, it may be a valuable technique for
morphological experiments but have less value for certain kinds of metabolic or
biochemical investigations.

X. Growth-Retarding Compounds
A. GENERAL GROWTH RETARDANTS

The growth of cultured plant cells and tissues in vitro is often dependent upon
exogenously added growth substances (see Steward & Krikorian, 1971; Fry & Street,
1980; Gray & Conger, 1985; Yopp et a1., 1986; Fellman & Read, 1987; Jackson et a1.,
1987; Krikorian et a1., 1987; Takahashi et a1., 1990; Tiburcio et a1., 1990; Horgan &
Scott, 1991; Kaminek et a1., 1992; Mok & Mok, 1994; Mok, 1994; Krikorian, 1995,
and references cited therein). Indeed, Kisouye et a1. (1990, 1993) have drawn attention
to the fact that normally toxic heavy metal ions and hypochlorite, when used in “low”
doses can initiate or foster somatic embryogenesis and thus, in this context, can be
regarded as “growth substances.” There is, moreover, a massive, more conventional
literature on growth regulators used in practical settings to retard growth (Frenkel &
Haard, 1973; Nickell, 1982; Scheel & Casida, 1985; Flores et a1., 1990; Halmann, 1990;
Davis & Curry, 1991; Rademacher, 1991; Abeles et a1., 1992; Davies, 1995), but use

of these would more than likely have to be experiment-specific (Grossmann & Jung,
1984). Arguably, the plant growth regulator ethylene is much too general a growth
retardant (Meijer, 1989; Auboiron et a1., 1990; Rademacher, 1991; Abeles et a1., 1992)
and the same may be said of abscisic acid (see Ammirato, 1983; Davies & Jones, 1991).
Even though both are naturally occurring hormones, they normally have many adverse
side effects (Smith et a1., 1989), so it seems that their use should be avoided. They
(especially abscisic acid) could conceivably be used in managing cultured cells at the
outset of an experiment. That is, presence of abscisic acid in the nutrient medium at
the beginning, followed by flushing it out to activate cell culture growth, might be a
workable strategy, but it would again be so experiment-specific as to not merit our
concern. It should be pointed out, however, that abscisic acid has been used in
combination with osmotic agents such as mannitol or sorbitol for the tissue culture
storage of potato germplasm grown as shoot tips (Westcott, 1981). In vitro shoots and
plantlets become very stunted, but normal growth ensues upon return to retardant-free
medium and withdrawal of osmotic agents.

Plant biology investigators will be aware of the potential for use of abscisic acid as a
retardant in a given system. If it is appropriate and meets their needs, they will be able to
draw upon it.

B. CELL CYCLE INHIBITORS

The cyclical events of cell multiplication involve both morphological events and
biochemical syntheses—the replication of visible structures and organelles and of
macromolecules (Ito & Komamine, 1993; Hemerly et a1., 1993). Classical cytology of
the nucleus and the wealth of modern knowledge that deals withcells in division and
in interphase comprises a literature too vast to be more than superficially referred to
here (Sharma & Sharma, 1980; Phillips, 1981; Francis, 1992; Murray, 1992; Ormrod,
1993; Singh, 1993). Obviously, such considerations are fundamental to any under-
standing of the different ways by which chemical substances may intervene to affect
cell growth and cell division and to know how and when they act in relation to the cell
cycle (see Wilson, 1965; Rost & Gifford, 1977; Gould, 1984; Davidson, 1991; Francis,
1992).

Figure 7 provides a simple scheme of areas points at which there might be potential
for having an impact at speciﬁc control points for cell multiplication. Mitoclastic agents,
or antimitotics (i.e., chemicals that interrupt the normal course of mitosis), have been
known for a very long time (Wilson, 1965). The first of these studied was chloral hydrate,
Cl3CH0H (OH)2, used in aqueous solution at about 0.75%. An excellent summary of this
early literature may be found in Mangenot (1941). Various plant alkaloids such as
cinchonamine, quinine, strychnine, brucine, papaverine, narcotine, nicotine, and purines
such as caffeine and theophylline were early shown to have varying degrees of mitoclastic
effect. The best known of these is colchicine, which over the years has been the agent of
choice for use in plant cytology. (Methyl colchicine, colcemid, which differs from
colchicine by having an N -methyl group instead of a N-acetyl group, is widely used by
animal cell workers but less so by plant cytologists, and the same is true of the alkaloid
vinblastine.) Extremely low concentrations of all arsenicals (e.g., dimethyl sodium
arsenate, sodium cacodylate) can act like colchicine. Mercuric ethyl phosphate is another
mitotic inhibitor. While all such compounds stop mitosis, their effects are toxic enough
to render them inappropriate for our needs.

There is an extensive literature that deals with substances like colchicine, stega-
nacin, maytansine, podophyllotoxin, vinblastine, taxol, etc. (see Vaughn & Vaughan,
1988; Devine et a1., 1993). The main emphasis on these substances has been their use
in treating human cancer cells, but in plants their interest stems primarily from use as
cytostatics in chromosome procedures such as metaphase analysis (see Sharma &
Sharma, 1980; Phillips, 1981; Krikorian et a1., 1982; Singh, 1993). These alkaloids are
problematical for the stated objectives since they disorganize the spindle components
and poison the microtubules and bring about metaphase arrest, from which recovery
may be incomplete (Vaughn & Vaughn, 1988; Devine et a1., 1993). Short-term exposure
can cause a number of metabolic responses (e.g.~, Hart & Sabnis, 1976; Sloan & Camper,
1981, and references cited therein). Protracted exposure may result in multiplication
of the number of chromosomes and for that reason they are used to induce polyploidy
in plants. It is interesting to note that animal cells are much more sensitive to colchicine
than are plant cells, and the concentrations needed to disrupt microtubules in plants is
typically 100 to 1000 times that needed in animal cells (usually ca. 1.25 x 10'5 to 7.2
x 10'3 M). The molecular mechanism for this resistance is not clear, but plant micro-
tubules appear to be more cross-bridged than those of animal cells (Devine et a1., 1993,
and references cited therein).

There is an extensive literature on the use of various synthetic chemicals as herbicides
(Fedtke, 1982). Some of these are acetohydroxyacid synthase inhibitors and hence affect
amino acid synthesis (Scheel & Casida, 1985); others act as microtubule disruptors
(Devine et a1., 1993). It seems unlikely that use of such compounds even at low levels
would serve our purposes.

Various antibiotics such as the fungistatic griseofulvin can also have cytostatic
effects on plants, but these, too, are coupled with varying levels of toxicity (Schaffner,
1979; Bérdy, 1980; Lo Schiavo et a1., 1980; Pollock et a1., 1983; Kavi Kishor & Mehta,

1988; Vyas, 1988; Robert et al., 1989; Tsang etal., 1989). (Other antibiotics may even
stimulate plant growth.) Use of the antibiotic aphidicolin (from Nigrospora sphaerica)
an a—like DNA polymerase inhibitor at ca. 5—30 ug/ml of solution, acting at the G1/S
border, would seem to have some potential (J oyce & Steitz, 1994), but further consid-
eration indicates that it, too, has its limitations, since its effects seem to be relatively
short-term and are best used in concert with colchicine to get cells synchronized (Guri
et al., 1984). The same may be said for hydroxyurea, also said to act primarily but not
exclusively as an inhibitor of DNA polymerase (Davidson, 1991, and references cited
therein).

Aphidicolin has been only superﬁcially studied in plant cells, and it would be worth
an effort to see whether plant cells treated with it could be kept quiescent for prolonged
periods without adverse consequences (Guri et al., 1984). Nevertheless, it seems that the
general conclusion is justified that there seem to be few chemical compounds available
that are selective enough to fulfill our requirement of being able to stop reversibly a
critical stage in the plant cell cycle for a protracted period of time without the usual
concomitant adverse effects. The use of mitoclastic agents, even DNA polymerase
inhibitors, shOuld not be pursued to any great extent but one should be alert to learn of
new developments.

XI. Conclusions

The work discussed in this review demonstrates that if an appropriate technique is
used, the potential for limiting metabolic activity and developmental progression is
substantial, and that there is no a priori reason to lose culture characteristics. The maj or
limitation is that the time elapsed between cessation and reestablishment of cell culture
growth may entail a number of cell divisions and, hence, questions relating to how the
“memory” of a plant cell that has been exposed to hypo-G works and how a plant cell
transduces a G-stimulus into useful biochemical information may be lost or seriously
obfuscated (Brown, 1992, 1996). There appears to be no single strategy that will be
applicable to all systems; accordingly, any proposed strategy will have to be carefully
matched with a given system and the desired objectives of an experiment. A variety of
research opportunities exist to resolve issues of minimal- or zero-growth maintenance
for cultured cells and tissues destined to be used as test systems in the u-G environment
of Space. Keeping cells inactive or quiescent at the beginning of an experiment seems
to be an easier objective to realize than keeping cultures quiescent after periodic
sampling and at the end of the experiment prior to return to Earth and the execution of
postrecovery analysis. Clearly, many investigators will wish to terminate a Space
experiment by chemical fixation and rapid freezing. But there will be a desire or need
on the part of some to get back material “alive.” The following comments indicate that
a combination of options might end up providing the most realistic solution(s) to the
problem at hand. Research should go far toward resolving the requirements.

No special attempt should be made to investigate the direct use of reduced gaseous
oxygen as a means to conserve cell cultures. Attention will, of necessity, be paid to gaseous
environment when specifications for oxygenation or aeration are stipulated for a given
test system.

There may be special circumstances in which critical lowering or depletion of a
particular nutrient might be useful for cell culture management. This strategy is not the

preferred option for storage of cells at the end of an experiment; it may, however, have
value at the initiation.

Aphidicolin has been inadequately studied in plant cells, though it would be worth the
effort to establish whether plant cells treated with it could be kept quiescent for prolonged
periods without adverse consequences. Nevertheless, the general conclusion is that there
are few substances available that are selective enough to fulfill our requirement of
reversibly stopping a critical stage in the plant cell cycle for a protracted period of time
without the usual concomitant adverse effects. Use of mitoclastic agents, even DNA
polymerase inhibitors, should probably not be pursued to any great extent, but one should
keep abreast of new developments.

Plant biologists will be aware of the potential for use of abscisic acid as a retardant in
a given system. If its value is demonstrated, they will be able to draw upon it. However,
use of retardants like abscisic acid would seem to be experiment-specific.

The recommendation for the moment is that the process of cryopreservation by
vitrification be placed on a “technology watch” so that significant new developments may
be quickly recognized and appreciated for what they are worth vis-a-vis their potential
for incorporation into Space plant cell and tissue culture experiment management and
implementation schemes. It is important to note that cryopreservation of cells via vitrifi-
cation could have substantial signiﬁcance for the initiation of an experiment in Space.
Substantial problems would be encountered at the end of an experiment or “in between”
samplings only because the procedures are not trivial. It may well turn out that an
adaptation of the process or “intermediate” procedure, in which the principle of vitriﬁca-
tion is capitalized upon but liquid is avoided, may provide a valuable avenue for
investigation at the end of an experiment.

Osmotic adjustment can play a valuable role in plant cell culture management and
will inevitably play a role in handling cells since osmotic relations are an integral part of
the ability of plant cells to grow (see Stiles, 1960; Calcott, 1981, and references cited
therein). Investigations should be carried out to develop and define this technology.
Additionally, the method should be viewed as being a very important component of
vitrification for cryopreservation (see below).

Chilling offers considerable opportunity to manage cell and tissue cultures of
higher plants and other organisms. In some instances chilling is simple and can be
performed at a single reduced temperature level; in other cases a fluctuating regime of
various low temperatures seems to be useful or is supposedly required. In still others,
lowered temperature is more of a problem. This emphasizes that (1) while chilling
provides considerable opportunity to slow down growth dramatically, this must be
closely tied to the biology of the system and (2) any engineering associated with
chilling must be precise enough to maintain temperature tolerances within close or
specified limits.

Mineral oil overlay offers considerable potential for investigating the preservation of
plant cells, especially during the period when samplings are being carried out and
especially at the end of an experiment. Use of it should be pursued both in isolation and
in combination with chilling and low-temperature storage procedures.

There is high potential for the use of immobilization using entrapment gels. However,
before one gets too optimistic about the use of this method, even for unorganized cell
cultures, the ease with which the procedures can be used in a cell culture—unit context
needs to be determined. There seems to be more optimism for use of the system with
somatic embryo—producing systems, but even here similar problems obtain. In any case,

entrapment in and of itself does not stop growth but may retard it. Combined use of this
technology with low temperature should be pursued.

Low pH can provide a tool for cell culture management in specific cases at the outset
of an experiment in a cell culture unit provided the biology of the system is amenable to
it. It seems less likely that it will have major value by itself in the course of, or at the end
of, an experiment in Space. There seems to be a fair amount of evidence that major
metabolic changes are effected when pH is changed. This probably means little at the
outset of an experiment before it is activated. Nevertheless, we should test whether
lowering pH at the end of an embryogenesis experiment is able to maintain cells at zero
growth with minimal change in qualities and characteristics at least insofar as capacity
for later development into plantlets is concerned. In short, it may be a valuable technique
for morphological experiments but may have less value for certain kinds of biochemical
investigations.
