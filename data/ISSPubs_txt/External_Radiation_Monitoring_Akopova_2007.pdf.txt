Abstract

Space radiation dosimetry presents one of the greatest challenges in the ﬁeld of radiation safety. In the present paper the dosimetric data
collected over the last 20 years of radiation ﬁeld measurement on near—Earth orbits are presented. The measurements were carried out
aboard “Cosmos” spacecrafts (1979—1989), “Mir” station (1988 and 1991), as well as on board the ISS (2002). For determination of impor-
tant Characteristics of cosmic rays (particle ﬂuxes, LET and fast neutron spectra, equivalent doses and heavy ion ﬂuxes) a nuclear emulsion
has been used as a controllable threshold detector. An integral LET spectrum was measured in the range of 0.5—3.5 X 103 keV/uni. The
energy spectra of fast neutrons With E : 1—15 MeV have been also studied and induced equivalent doses calculated.
