Abstract
Here, we report Changes gene expression and morphology of the renal epithelial cell line, A6, which was derived from Xenopus
laevis adult kidney that had been induced by long—term culturing with a three—dimensional clinostat. An oligo microarray analysis on
the A6 cells showed that mRNA levels for 52 out of 8091 genes were signiﬁcantly altered in response to clinorotation. On day 5,
there was no dramatic Change in expression level, but by day 8 and day 10, either upregulation 0r downregulation of gene expression
became evident. By day 15, the expression levels of 18 out of 52 genes had returned to the original levels, while the remaining 34
genes maintained the altered levels of expression. Quantitative analyses of gene expression by real—time PCR conﬁrmed that changes
in the mRNA levels of selected genes were found only under Clinorotation and not under hypergraVity (7g) or ground control. Mor—
phological changes including loss of dome—like structures and disorganization of both E—cadherin adherence junctions and cortical
actin were also observed after 10 days of culturing with Clinorotation. These results revealed that the expression of selected genes was
altered speciﬁcally in A6 cells cultured under Clinorotation.
