In view of Iong-haul space exploration missions, the European Space Agency initiated the Micro-
Ecological Life Support System Alternative (MELiSSA) project targeting the total recycling of
organic waste produced by the astronauts into oxygen, water and food using a loop of bacterial and
higher plant bioreactors. In that purpose, the oc-proteobacterium, Rhodospirillum rubrum S1H, was
sent twice to the International Space Station and was analyzed post-flight using a newly developed
R. rubrum whole genome oligonucleotide microarray and high throughput geI-free proteomics with
Isotope-Coded Protein Label technology. Moreover, in an effort to identify a specific response of
R. rubrum S1H to space flight, simulation of microgravity ancI space-ionizing radiation were
performed on Earth under identical culture set-up and growth conditions as encountered during the
actual space journeys. Transcriptomic and proteomic data were integrated and permitted to put
forward the importance of medium composition and culture set-up on the response of the bacterium
to space flight-related environmental conditions. In addition, we showed for the first time that a low
dose of ionizing radiation (2 mGy) can induce a significant response at the transcriptomic level,
although no change in cell viability and only a few significant differentially expressed proteins were
observed. From the MELISSA perspective, we could argue the effect of microgravity to be
minimized, whereas R. rubrum S1H could be more sensitive to ionizing radiation during Iong-term
space exploration mission.
