doi: 101111/“399-3054_2005_00544_X and cellulose in hypergravity—treated coleoptiles increased progressively as
much as those in the control coleoptiles. As a result, their contents per unit
length of coleoptile largely increased under hypergravity conditions. In the
hemicellulose fraction, the amounts of arabinose and xylose, the major compo—
nents of the fraction, prominently increased in response to hypergravity.
When hemicellulosic polysaccharides were separated into neutral and acidic
polymers by an anion—exchange column, the amounts of the acidic fraction
consisting of (glucurono)arabinoxy|ans were higher in hypergravity—treated
coleoptiles than in control coleoptiles. The amounts of cell waII—bound
ferulic acid and diferulic acid (DFA) increased dramatically in both 1 g
control and hypergravity—treated coleoptiles. Particularly, the amounts
of DFA in hypergravity—treated coleoptiles were significantly higher than
those in control coleoptiles during the incubation period. These results
suggest that continuous hypergravity increases the rigid network structures
via arabinoxylan—hydroxycinnamate cross—Iinks within cell wall architecture
in wheat coleoptiles. These structures may have a load—bearing function and
contribute to construct the stable cell wall against the gravitational force.
