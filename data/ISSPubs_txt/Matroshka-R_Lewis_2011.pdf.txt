A passive neutron-bubble dosemeter (BD), developed by Bubble Technology Industries, has been used for space applications.

Both the bubble detector—personal neutron dosemeter and bubble detector spectrometer have been studied at ground-based

facilities in order to characterise their response due to neutrons, heavy ion particles and protons. This technology was ﬁrst 0

used during the Canadian—Russian collaboration aboard the Russian satellite BION-9, and subsequently on other space mis- g

sions, including later BION satellites, the space transportation system, Russian MIR space station and International Space 3

Station. This paper provides an overview of the experiments that have been performed for both ground-based and space §

studies in an effort to characterise the response of these detectors to various particle types in low earth orbit and presents g

results from the various space investigations. 1;
