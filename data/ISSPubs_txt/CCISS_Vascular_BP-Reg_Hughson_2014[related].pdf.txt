FUNDING

The research described in this manuscript was supported by the Canadian Space Agency. All

research was conducted independently by the Principal Investigator and Co-investigators.

ABSTRACT

A comprehensive goal of the Canadian Space Agency studies (CCISS, Vascular and BP Reg) has

been to investigate the efﬁcacy of current exercise countermeasures to maintain cardiovascular and

cerebrovascular health on return to Earth after up to 6-months in space. Results from the CCISS

experiments revealed no signiﬁcant change of in-ﬂight heart rate during daily activities or sleep,

and small, but variable between astronauts, post-ﬂight elevation. The between astronaut differences

were exaggerated during measurement of spontaneous baroreﬂeX slope, which was reduced post-

ﬂight (P<0.05) during paced breathing with 3 astronauts having significant correlations between

reduced baroreﬂeX and reduced RR-interval (consistent with reduced fitness). Cerebrovascular

autoregulation and C02 response were mildly impaired after ﬂight. Some loss of in-ﬂight ﬁtness of

bpm, 10.4i5.9 bpm and 13.4i5.7 bpm for early-ﬂight, late-ﬂight and RH respectively. On return
to gravity, Changes in resting heart rate for supine (5.9i3.5 bpm), sit (8.1i3.3 bpm) and stand
(10.3i10.0 bpm) were small but variable between individuals (from -5 bpm to +20 bpm in post-
ﬂight standing) and not related to the change in exercise heart rate. In Vascular astronauts, pulse
wave transit time measured to the finger tended to be reduced post-ﬂight and carotid artery
distensibility was significantly reduced (P=0.03, n=6). The heart rate and baroreﬂex data suggest
that some astronauts return With cardiovascular deconditioning in spite of the exercise regimes.
However, greater arterial stiffness is common to all astronauts studied to date. The new CSA
project, BP Reg, will monitor inﬂight blood pressure in an attempt to identify astronauts in greater
need for countermeasures. Future research should focus on Whether vascular Changes in astronauts
might make them an appropriate model to study the mechanisms of arterial aging on Earth.

"4","DECONDITIONING WITH SPACEFLIGHT

One of the earliest observations of astronauts returning from short- or long-duration spaceﬂight was
a consistent cardiovascular deconditioning on return to Earth [24]. To date, most results have been
compiled from short-duration space shuttle missions and Russian observations With longer ﬂights.
Reduced physical ﬁtness [12,21], altered autonomic reﬂex control [4,13], and reduced cardiac
muscle mass [1,17] are frequently documented after spaceﬂight. Aerobic and resistance exercises
are prescribed for astronauts living on the International Space Station (188). Indeed, the schedules
have allocated up to 2.5 h/day for exercise including the time for setup and cleaning up after
exercise [11,20]. However, it is unclear if the actual exercise performed on 188 is sufﬁcient to
maintain cardiovascular health. Recent reports of musculoskeletal ﬁtness after return from 188
suggested that astronauts exercised less than 1 hour/day and that there was loss of muscle mass and
ﬁtness [20].

CANADIAN SPACE AGENCY EXPERIMENTS

To gain insight into the effectiveness of current countermeasures for the maintenance of
cardiovascular health during long-duration spaceﬂight, the Canadian Space Agency (CSA) has
supported three experiments: Cardiovascular and Cerebrovascular control on return from the
International Space Station (CCISS); Cardiovascular Health Consequences of Long-duration
Spaceﬂight (Vascular) and Blood Pressure Regulation and Risk of Fainting on Return from Space
(BP Reg). The CCISS experiment examined cardiovascular health in 7 astronauts (1 woman). Flight
durations averaged 147i49 days, With 3 astronauts landing at Kennedy Space Center, 1 at Dryden
Flight Research Center, and 3 in Kazakhstan With return to Star City outside Moscow. The CSA
experiment Vascular is in progress but has studied 7 astronauts (3 women), all of Whom have landed
in Kazakhstan after 176i13 days on 188 followed by return to Star City (n=1) or direct return to

"
"5","Johnson Space Center and testing on the next day (R+1). The BF Reg experiment has started and 4
astronauts have all returned to J ohnson Space Center for testing on R+1.

HEART RATE DURING ACTIVITIES OF DAILY LIVING

The first reports during long-duration spaceﬂight of simultaneous monitoring of physical activity
from the Actiwatch placed on each of the ankle and wrist, in combination with heart rate from 24-
hour Holter recording were published with the CCISS experiments. Ankle activity counts recorded
in activities of daily living were signiﬁcantly reduced during spaceﬂight, as was the associated
transient increase in HR during these activities [5]. The marked reduction in ankle activity counts
during spaceﬂight is Clear from this example and could be taken as a reﬂection of an extreme
sedentary lifestyle as often described with aging [8]. The only stimulus to the heart for maintenance
of cardiovascular fitness occurred during the planned daily exercise sessions. While astronauts are
allocated 2.5-h per day for exercise, the time spent in actual exercise is considerably less than this.
Indeed, the CCISS astronauts completed aerobic exercises 4-8 times per week with average duration
22-48 minutes per session, and conducted resistance exercises 4-6 times per week [5]. For example,
one astronaut near the end of the mission completed aerobic exercise everyday varying from 10
minutes at 3.0 mph on the treadmill when the session coincided with a resistive exercise session on
the advanced resistive exercise device (ARED), to a maximum of 45 minutes at 5.0 mph on a day
with no resistive exercise.

INDICATORS OF CARDIAC HEALTH

Heart rate variability (HRV) provides an overall indicator of cardiovascular health as reﬂected by
the Changes in autonomic nervous system balance in the regulation of cardiovascular control. Head-
down bed rest, an analog of spaceﬂight, caused reduced HRV [9]. Aging and disease also cause

"
"6","reduced HRV [16] but physical training can maintain HRV in older individuals [7]. The CCISS
experiment revealed that high frequency (>0.15 Hz) HRV was reduced during spontaneous
breathing at rest [10] and during sleep [26]. In contrast with the ground-based studies of head-down
bed rest, resting HR was not significantly Changed. A potential mechanism to explain these
differences lies in the effect of gravity on the respiratory pump on venous return [10]. In space,
smaller variations in stroke volume and pulse pressure occurred at the respiratory (high) frequency
reducing the impact on the arterial baroreﬂeX to modulate parasympathetic nervous activity to the
sinoatrial node within a respiratory cycle. Post-ﬂight there were reductions in HRV at low and high
frequencies while there was a trend to reduction in post-ﬂight RR-interval (P=0.07) suggesting that
an overall reduction in parasympathetic nervous activity contributed to the decrease in HRV.
Considerable between individual differences were observed with large reductions in post—ﬂight
resting RR-interval associated with greater reductions in HRV.

ARTERIAL BAROREFLEX

The CCISS experiments measured the arterial baroreﬂeX before, during and after long-duration
spaceﬂight from the sequence method that related spontaneous Changes in RR-interval with ﬁnger
arterial blood pressure measured in space with the continuous blood pressure device (CBPD). Pre-
and post-ﬂight, astronauts were studied in supine and seated postures. The arterial baroreﬂeX slope
was not different inﬂight compared to pre-ﬂight baseline in either the supine or seated postures
[10]. Post—ﬂight, a signiﬁcant reduction was observed only in paced breathing (10 breaths/min).
Large Changes in baroreﬂeX slope were observed in individuals who did the most aerobic exercise
sessions while on 188. While this observation seems contrary to expectations, it is probable that the
individuals who did the most aerobic exercise while on 188 were also the astronauts who
incorporated large quantities of aerobic exercise into their pre-ﬂight routines. That is, they had the
lowest heart rate prior to spaceﬂight due to high parasympathetic tone, but were unable to maintain

"
"7","their high aerobic ﬁtness on 188 due to the lack of loading of the treadmill device [6,25]. These
astronauts also reported frequent dizziness that might have been related to post-ﬂight 0rth0static
hypotension.

ARTERIAL STIFFNESS

Increased arterial stiffness, normally observed with aging [14], has recently been observed during
and after spaceﬂight including long-duration ISS missions as well as short-duration shuttle ﬂights
[2,22]. Baevsky and colleagues [2] measured the pulse wave transit time from the R-wave 0f the
ECG t0 the arrival of the ﬁnger pressure wave. The observations of faster transit time from pre- to
post-ﬂight in the Vascular experiment (P=0.07) were almost identical to these previous data.
However, preliminary new data from the ﬁrst 6 astronauts in the Vascular study revealed reductions
in carotid artery distensibility after approximately 6 months in space. Given the observations in
older sedentary individuals that 3 months of walking or jogging for 40 min/day reduced carotid and
peripheral artery stiffness, possibly through enhanced bioavailability of nitric oxide [19], we
investigated whether astronauts who maintained physical fitness would have less change in pulse
wave transit time to the ﬁnger. There was no relationship between change in pulse wave transit time
and the change in heart rate at a ﬁxed work rate (mean pre-ﬂight heart rate approximately 145i17
bpm) as seen in Figure 2. It is established that multiple factors could contribute to increased arterial
stiffness with aging including increased vasoconstrictor or reduced vasodilator factors, structural
breakdown of elastin, accumulation of collagen, vascular smooth muscle cell proliferation and
increased cross-linking in the extracellular matrix [14,28]. The possible roles of these factors related
to the increased arterial stiffness with spaceﬂight have not been investigated. The animal model of
hindlimb suspension, used as an analog of spaceﬂight, revealed cellular hypertrophy in the middle
cerebral artery with a potential role for activation of vascular wall renin-angiotensin system [27].
Other experiments with a similar animal model suggested increased cross-linkage in the major

"
"8","elastic arteries [23]. The Vascular experiment is collecting data to test these mechanisms. It is not
Clear from the cosmonaut data of Baevsky and colleagues Whether the increased stiffness is an acute
or long-term effect of spaceﬂight. Lifelong increased arterial stiffness in aging has important health
consequences associated With increased systolic arterial blood pressure that can lead to target organ
damage [15] such as increased cerebrovascular resistance With a reduction in brain blood ﬂow in
otherwise healthy elderly individuals [18]. These data reveal that, like bone loss, cardiovascular
health consequences of spaceﬂight require further research to establish effective countermeasures.
DEVELOPING INDIVIDUAL COUNTERMEASURES

The CCISS and Vascular studies have revealed a range of individual responses to long-duration
spaceﬂight. It is not possible from current data to determine how genetic variations versus exercise
regimes might have resulted in the various outcomes although this is a logical question based on
studies showing heritability of training responses [3]. Research is required to identify astronauts
WhO are in greater need for countermeasures to prevent cardiovascular deconditioning during long-
duration spaceﬂights and in future exploration missions. Changes of structure and/or function in
different physiological systems can have different health consequences. Sensitive biomarkers
should be developed to monitor during spaceﬂight and a “healthy range” should be deﬁned. Beyond
this, speciﬁc “thresholds” should be established for application of more intensive countermeasures.
It has been assumed that inﬂight exercise testing can provide a sensitive biomarker of physical
ﬁtness. Adjustments of exercise routines are based on the outcomes to maintain aerobic ﬁtness and
strength. However, the variability observed in heart rate at a ﬁxed work rate in Vascular requires
greater probing of the links between exercise routines and other daily stressors that might affect the

"
"9","heart rate response. Periodization of training could be used to adjust the stress on the astronaut
while considering time available and important resources such as food and water.

The current experiment BP Reg is attempting to focus on one aspect of cardiovascular health; that
is, regulation of arterial blood pressure (BP) on return to upright posture on Earth. The experiment
monitors BP during a challenge that is similar to standing up on Earth while still in space. The
experiment inﬂates large cuffs (Leg Arm Cuff System, LACS) about the upper legs to a pressure
above systolic BP for 3-min then rapidly deﬂates the cuffs while BP is monitored with the
continuous blood pressure device (CBPD). On Earth, the BP response during transition to standing
and supine leg cuff deﬂation was similar (Figure). It is anticipated that astronauts who have the
greatest change in the BP response to leg cuff deﬂation comparing the inﬂight response with the
pre-ﬂight baseline will be those who have a greater drop in BP on standing after ﬂight. Results from
this biomarker test could be used to apply countermeasures that will mimic the effects of gravity on
the cardiovascular system such as lower body negative pressure or centrifuge if these devices are
available on 188.

In the future, immediate feedback to assist in assignment of speciﬁc countermeasures could be
based on devices for testing biomarkers including portable biochemical analyzers to monitor blood,
saliva or urine in space. These devices could be particularly relevant for assessment of factors
related to increased arterial stiffness [2], oxidative stress and nutrient balance. Safe return of
astronauts to Earth depends on their ability to function independently, maintain optimal health and
ﬁtness, meet anticipated and unexpected Challenges of their mission while in space.
