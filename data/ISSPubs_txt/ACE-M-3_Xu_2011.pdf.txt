Conventional diffusion <AR2(t)) = 2Dt gives way to subdiffusion <AR2(t)) ~ t“, 0 < ,u. < 1 when the
waiting time distribution ¢(7) is n0nintegrab1e. We have studied a model system, colloidal particles
functionalized with DNA “sticky ends” diffusing on a complementary coated surface. We Observe a
crossover from subdiffusive to conventional behavior for <AR2(t)) and ¢(7) as temperature is increased
near the particle-surface melting temperature consistent With a simple Gaussian distribution of sticky
ends. Our results suggest that any system With randomness in its binding energy should eXhibit
subdiffusive behavior as it unbinds. This Will strongly affect the kinetics of self—assembly.
