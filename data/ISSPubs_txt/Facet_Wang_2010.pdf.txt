The new phase field model for strongly anisotropic systems proposed by Torabi et al.“ was employed to
simulate the faceted cellular growth in three dimensions. Simulation reveals the whole formation process of
the faceted cellular Clearly. Simulation results also show that a linear relation of undereooling and growth ve—

holds during the shape selection stage. During the facet cellular formation, the orystaI—melt interface is kept
isothermal although the interface is sawtooth, and areas with negative temperature gradient appear in the
melts, particularly at the ravine bottom of the sawtooth interface.
