Cancer risk from exposure to galactic cosmic rays:
Implications for space exploration by human beings

Space programmes are shifting toward planetary exploration, and in particular towards missions by human beings to LancetOnc012006; 7: 431—35

Predictions of the nature and magnitude of risks posed by exposure to radiation in space are subject to many (FACUciéott; PhD);;nd
uncertainties. In recent years, worldwide efforts have focussed on an increased understanding of the oncogenic Department of Physics and
