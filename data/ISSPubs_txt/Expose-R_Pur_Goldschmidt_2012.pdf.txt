Abstract This paper prescntw the principles and application of DNA based biological UV
dosimeters, as dcvckmcd by Research Group for Biophysics (ROB). These dosimeters are
used for assessing the biological hazard of living systems on the Baﬂh‘s surface and in
different waters (rivers, lakes, seas, em). The UV dosimetry system has also been used in the
space. In dosimeters a bacterial virus, bacteriophage T7 and polycrystalline uracil thin layers ‘
have been used as biological detectors. On the Earth’s surface the UV radiation induces
dimer formation in phage T7 and in the uracil detector, which was evaluated by loss of
viability of the phage particles and by the decnease of the characteristic optical density (OD)
of uracil thin layers. Recently the development of human space activities has also increased
the need to measure the biological effect ofcxtmtcrrcstrial solar radiation. too. The evaluation of
the space samples occurred on ground, thus only the starting and the ﬁnal state were taken into
account A new improved, automated method is presented below which makes data collection
more efﬁcient and also makes the dynamics of thc process observable.

ct al. 3009). To investigate micmorganisms and molecules outside of the International Space
Station (188), i.c. in Earth’s orbit, an international scientiﬁc consortium was set up: the
Response of Organisms to Space anironment (ROSE) consortium (Homeck ct a}. 1090).
The parameters, characteristic for the hostile environment, are the temperature (low and.
high), space vacuum, galactic cosmic radiation and solar radiation. The latter is hazardous
because of the high irradiance and unusual Spectral composition (Weber and Greenberg
I 085; Rettberg and Rotsehild 2002). Ehage and grad! {esponse (PU R) is (me of the experimean
perfonned by the ROSE consortium.

The main goal of the PUR experiment is the investigation and quantiﬁcation of the effects
ot‘speciﬁc space pametcrs on the survivability of nucleic acids using the following models:
bacteriophage T7, isolated phage T7 nucleic acid, polycrystalline uracil. Phage T7 and uracil
were already used as biological UV dosimeters on Earth (R'onté ct 3]. i992; Gréf et a1., ‘
I996)

‘ Our aim is to study how the concepts and technologies of biological UV dosimetry can be
adapted to space conditions with special interest to the spectral composition of the extrater-
restriai solar radiation. The effect of short wavelength UV components of the solar radiation
on these objects was already studied for bacteriophage T7 (Rontt') ct al. 2002).
Biodosimetry Principles
Life on Earth is based on a common principle:

Ribonucleic acids (RNA) and deoxyribonucleic acids (DNA) regulate the biochemical
reactions in cells. There are two good reasons why these molecules are important to be
protected: They are on one hand complex and vulnerable to environmental stmssors, and on
the other hand they are responsible for vital processes and reproduction at the cellular level.

The criteria mentioned above demonstrate why these macromolecules are considered as
good indicators of biological radiation effects. More than 50 years ago it was demonstrated
that the reversion of UV induced (e.g. at A~280 nm) pyrimidine dimers in DNA could be
induced by shnrter wavelength (e.g. A~23O nm) UV radiation (Fisher and Johns 1"") ?6) which
is present in extraterrestrial solar spectrum. Similar information on the photobiologicai effect
of far UV radiation has been obtained using, synchrotron radiation facilities for irradiating the
biological samples.

0 The spectrum of extraterrestrial solar radiation contains far UV components too. so both
dimerization and monomerization processes can be induced in nucleic acid (NA) samples, .
{or in its constituents, like uracil bases) in space. Formation of dimers can cause lethal
effects, while reversion of dimers can repair the injury. For biological systems the latter
process can be beneﬁcial, thus for dosimetry purposes one has to take into account both
processes.

The polycrystalline uracil thin layers were prepared according to the evaporation tech-
nique and the quality of the thin layers was controlled spectroscopically (Grﬁf et al. 1996;
Kerékgyérlé et al. 1997).

The preparation of bacteriophage T7 was carried out according to the memod described in
Gaspar et a1. {1981), the isolation of T7 DNA is published in Fekete et a1. (1998), while the
preparation ot'T7 and T7 DNA thin layer is published in Fekete et al. (2004).

Under the inﬂuence of UV-B (280 mu 320 nm) or UV—C‘. (100 nm - 280 nm) irradiation
at normal temperature and atmospheric conditions photoproducts are formed consisting
mainly of cyclobumnc pyrimidine dimers (CPDs) and pyrimidine (6 4) pyrimidonc photo—
products (6 4PPs) (Fisher and Johns 1070; Rosenstein and Mitchell I987; Fckcte et a1.

1998). This effect can be measured by the extent of the decrease of the characteristic OD (at
280 nm’) of uracil (Gréf et a1. 1996).

UV exposure of the samples causes a decrease of the OD at the characteristic wavelength
(Ax288 nm), indicating the decrease of the intact form of uracil molecules in the thin layer; ,
in other words the extent of the decrease - as indicated in the uracil model - shows the extent
of photoproduet formation in nucleic acids.

Figure I shows the decrease of the 01) of the uracil layers under the inﬂuence of the UV
irradiation from a germicidal (mercury-vapor) lamp, while Fig. 2 does the same under the
irradiation with a deuterium lamp. Both dose—etTeet curves have identical starting 0D value
and both of them show a tendency for saturation, however, the saturation levels differ in the
two cases. With the germicidal lamp the saturation extends to a lower OD value than with the
deuterium lamp (to about 60 % and 80 % of the original values, respectively).

Horncck ct al. (I 984) dcmonstmtcd that in Bacillus subtilis spores exposed to germicidal
lamp or to extraterrestrial solar radiation the spore photoproduet (5-thyminyt-5,6-
dihydrothyminc) and two other products were formed. According to our results short
wavelength UV mdiation (UV-B and UV-C) preferentially induces CPDs in polycrystalline
uracil layers (Fidy and Raksényi 1978; Grofct a1. 1996). In the irradiated uracil sample (Figs. t
anti 2) the lower OI) corresponds to a larger number of photopmducte (in this case (‘PD.~.)
induced by the irradiation with germicidal lamp; thus: the saturation level in Fig. l correeponds
to a higher amount of dimers, than that in Fig. 2‘.

The presence of the saturation level in the exposed uracil layer in both cases (Figs. 1 and 2)
can be interpreted by two simultaneous photoreactions occurring in opposite directions: the
photons can either ind use the addition of two uracil bases (photoaddition or photodimerization)
or can break the dimers into two uracil moleculw (monomerization or photorchrsion). Both
effects were described carhcr (c.g. Fisher and Johns 1976) and, were found also in simple
biological models (Ronté ct a1. 1067).

The difference between the two saturation levels in Figs. 1 and 2"". reﬂects the different
levels ofthc equilibrium between dimer formation and monomerization. In other words: the
shorter wavelength components of the deuterium lamp’s spectrum are more efﬁcient in thc
monomerization reaction of the uracil photoproducts than those ofgcrmicidal lamp, thus the
equilibn’um occurs at a lower number of dimers (Kovécx et a1. 2007).
Original Application
This concept was adapted in the PUR experiment as the part of the Expose-R platform
(Fig. 3), which was placed externally at the 188, where the samples were exposed directly to
thc extraterrestrial solar radiation using neutral density ﬁlters of various attenuation powers
(Rabbow ct a1. 2009). The measurements started on March 10, 2009 and were terminated on
2 IS1 January, 20: I. F igurc 4 shows the abaembly of EXPOSE-R. ‘ ‘

Platform experts. found that in the experiment the distribution of the radiation on the UV '
detectors is not homageneouq (E. Rahbow, personal communication); therefore the biological!
effective dose (BED) measured by diﬁ‘emnt samples cannot be compared. There is also a limit
for mmsurement accuracy and for kinetic studies. the detailed eval uation of the samples is in
pmcese.
The New Concept
In cooperation with the Budapest University of Technology and Fconomics Department of
Broadband Infocommunications and Electromagnetic Theory (BME HVT) Space Research
Group developed a new goal to achieve in-situ measurements during the space mission. This
implies that the changes in the OD 0f the uracil detectors should be measured on board and
sent to the ground base any time on demand, or corresponding to a prc-dcﬁned sequence.
This concept means there is no need to bring the samples back to the Earth, so it is possible
to use this system on satelliteq and space probes, even out of human-reachable orbits and in
outer space. Figure 5 show the main components of the new system and its interfaces to an
arbitrary spacecraft. _

Description of the equipment: the sunlight enters the sampleholder, where we apply ﬁlters
to reduce intensity, the weakened beam passes through the samples. Under the samples there
are two detectors with ﬁlters 280 and 360 nm. It is possible to collect data all time. In the
next it is given the short description of the block diagram presented in F ig. 5.

Building a whole spectrophotometer would be a great challenge, .since moving pieces,
such as motor rotated mirrors, sample manipulating mechanisms and Sun light shielding
actuators are vulnerable and could be damaged during launch and also have a relatively large
error rate without extreme g forces. The solution is to simplify it as much as possible
regarding the requirements. In the followings we will explain the reason and the way why
and how the above described mechanisms can be replaced with simple and robust parts of
the equipment without loosing important data.

1. Aiming to compare different samples possessing different characteristics from traditional
measurements we concluded that the irradiation has no effect on the OD value at longer
(0.9.. 360 nm) wavelengths. OD depends only on the sample itselfgiving a stable ground
for comparison.

Instead of any ideal hole ﬁlter a light source with l0 nm bandwidth can be used for
measurement at 280 nm and at 360 nm, thus the averaging can occur at both wavelength
tangen.

2. For every sample independent light sources and detectors could he used without moving
the samples. Both for the exposure to the solar light and the measurement of the effect
on the sample a closing/opening system can be used.

3. It is possible to use Sun as measurement light source, which means no need for moving
parts, and we can perform non—stop analysis. The device could be less complex, but we
should know the measured matter changes while mcasureci, which can be a source of
problems. If the time constant of the change ofthc 01) is much larger then the measurement
time, we don’t have to deal with it. Our experiments pmved this, which means the method
is applicable. Thus the solar light can be used as the measuring light, too.
Balloon Application
B BXUS program is an ESA sponsored high altitude balloon ekperiment for university
students. Our experiment was chosen for the selection workshnp, which will be held in
2011 December. We will have a chance to test our instrument in quasi-space conditions.
