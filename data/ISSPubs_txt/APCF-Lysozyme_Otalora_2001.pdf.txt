1. Introduction
Correspondence email: jmgmiz@ugr.es Crystal growth under microgravity proceeds by the same
chemical processes as on ground, the only difference between
them being ﬂuid dynamics: mass transport is nominally
diffusive in the weightless environment. Understanding crystal
quality enhancement in microgravity crystal growth is there-
fore a problem mainly related to ﬂuid physics.

Zero—gravity environments do not eXist in the real world; all
facilities for microgravity experimentation suffer from some
degree of residual acceleration and g-jitters, arising mostly
from orbiter manoeuvres. The inﬂuence of these g-jitters 0n
the dynamics of protein crystal growth in microgravity has
been observed recently (Garcia-Ruiz & Otalora, 1997; Snell et
al., 1997; Garcia-Ruiz et al., 2001). These deviations from true
microgravity are known to be the origin of a convective
contribution to mass transport triggered by surface tension at
free ﬂuid interfaces or by density gradients over the ﬂuid
(Walter, 1987). Free ﬂuid interfaces do exist in some protein
crystal growth techniques, namely in all variations of vapour-
transport methods. For these experiments, surface-tension
driven Marangoni convection is known to occur even in
microgravity scenarios (Molenkamp et al., 1994; Savino &
Monti, 1996). Crystal movements consistent With this
instability have been described in microgravity protein crystal
growth experiments (Chayen et al., 1997). The use of crystal-
lization techniques Without liquid—gas surfaces, such as free
interface diffusion, under microgravity is in principle a good
candidate for growing crystals in a convection-free scenario.
Even in this case, however, the effect of buoyancy-driven
convection must be assessed because concentration (density)
gradients eXist in the crystallizing solutions as an intrinsic
consequence of the very crystal-growth process.

As a crystal grows from the solution, it depletes the
concentration of the growth units that are incorporated into
the crystal lattice producing a concentration-depleted zone
