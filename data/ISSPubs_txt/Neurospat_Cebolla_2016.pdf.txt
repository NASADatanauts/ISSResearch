E the electroencephalogram (EEG) dynamics where oscillatory modulations were measured during a
visuo-attentional state preceding a visuo-motor docking task. Astronauts in microgravity conducted
the experiment in free-ﬂoating aboard the International Space Station, before the space ﬂight and
E afterwards. We observed stronger power decrease (~ERD: event related desynchronization) ofthe ~10 Hz
oscillation from the occipital-parietal (alpha ERD) to the central areas (mu ERD). Inverse source modelling
ofthe stronger alpha ERD revealed a shift from the posterior cingulate cortex (BA31, from the default
5 mode network) on Earth to the precentral cortex (BA4, primary motor cortex) in weightlessness. We also
observed signiﬁcant contribution ofthe vestibular network (BA40, BA32, and BA39) and cerebellum
(lobuleV, VI). We suggest that due to the high demands for the continuous readjustment of an appropriate
5 body posture in free-ﬂoating, this visuo-attentional state required more contribution from the motor
cortex. The cerebellum and the vestibular network involvement in weightlessness might support the
correction signals processing necessary for postural stabilization, and the increased demand to integrate
S incongruent vestibular information.
Brain oscillations underlie brain function and characterise brain statesl. In both the cerebral and cerebellar cor-

5 of the alpha rhythm decreases when opening the eyes, which is interpreted as reﬂecting entrance of Visual (and
E sensorimotor) information9. Similarly, the states of increased attention and sensory perception are associated
with a decrease in alpha power, which is thought to reﬂect the release of inhibitory control or “cortical excita-
f tion”10. More precisely anticipatory attention in the absence of stimulation is related to the diminution of alpha

The inﬂuence of weightlessness on the dynamic organization of the brain is a central issue for space neuroscience
g and has important implications for future long-term missions. It also helps clarify a number of issues in neurosci-
E ence“. Microgravity offers an environment where cognitive and sensorimotor functions are continuously chal-
lenged. The absence of graviception affects the vestibular information, which in turn disturbs the dynamic balance
3 with the Visual and the proprioception information that guarantees the coherent internalisation of gravity in the
3 human brain processing”. In the same line, it has been recently shown that gravity-related sensory inputs exert a
top-down modulation on Visual inputs involved in Virtual 3D navigation that is suppressed during microgravity”.

In microgravity the multiple sensory inputs must be dynamically re-weighted in order to maintain the behaV-
ioural goals”. The central nervous system must properly adapt in order to organize the control of functions
such as posture, eye-hand coordination, spatial orientation and navigation”. Astronauts’ performance remains
good after a variable period of adaptation12’15‘17. Thus microgravity offers an environment pushing the regulatory
process exerted on the different inputs to the cortex at the basis of adaptation. Previous EEG studies conducted
in microgravity have mainly focused on sleep characterization“19 and wakefulness alpha frequency band”. In
this line, it has been demonstrated that the power of the alpha rhythm produced by eye-opening/Closure state
transition is potentiated in microgravity compared to the situation on Earth. This effect was not due to noise,
haemodynamic effects or arousal. It was interpreted as an indicator of less connection with the environment”.
In the present study, we focus on an exploratory21 watchfulness observational state22 through a Visual—attention
task performed in microgravity aboard the International Space Station (188) during long-duration spaceﬂights.
We hypothesize that microgravity environment increases the global neural activity devoted to this task and thus
expresses a stronger spectral power diminution of the alpha rhythm.
Results
Alpha power decrease is reinforced during weightlessness. On Earth and in weightlessness, all
astronauts showed a power decrease or event-related desynchronization (ERD) in the alpha frequency range
with respect to the baseline prior to stimulus onset during the Visuo-attentional task. This alpha ERD is indicated
in the ERSP template by a blue band centered at 10 Hz (Fig. 1a). Additionally, a beta ERD band appears in the
subsequent Visuo—motor period. The individual alpha frequency ranges of interest at electrode C3 were: 8—12,
12—16, 8—12, 9—13, 7—11Hz, for participants A1, A2, A3, A4 and A5 respectively. All astronauts showed stronger
alpha ERD in weightlessness (W) (2,01 :I: 1.34 an/Hz :I: s.e.m) with respect to that measured on Earth before
(Eb, 1.17 :I: 0.99 an/Hz, p = 0.005,) and after (Ea, 1.32 :I: 1.11nV2/Hz, p = 0.02) the ﬂight (Fig. 2a, 0n the left)
(single-factor ANOVA test with 3 levels, Bonferroni corrected, F (2, 222) = 5,4047) during the Visuo-attentional
period. The individual ERD estimations (nVZ/Hz :I: s.e.m.) were 0.31 :I: 0.62, 1.21 :I: 0.46, 0.93 :I: 1.08, 0.72 :I: 0.52,
2,67 :I: 1,02 for Eb, 0.64 :I: 0.60, 1.73 :I: 0.99, 2,88 :I: 1.47, 1.21:|: 0.71, 3.59 :I: 1.32 for W and 0.29 :I: 0.75, 1.28 :I: 0.48,
0.92 :I: 0.80, 1.08 :I: 0.72, 3.07 :I: 1,63 for Ea, for A1, A2, A3, A4 and A5, respectively (Fig. 2a, on the right). The
observed reinforcement of the alpha ERD for the W condition was not an effect of a one-side signiﬁcant power
spectrum increase in the baseline period. In fact, the absolute power spectrum during the baseline period of the W
condition (1,82 :I: 2.91 nVZ/Hz) did not increase from Eb (2.85 :I: 1.54 nVZ/Hz), but presented a decreasing (not sig-
niﬁcant) trend (p = 0.11; F (2,222) = 4,9957). Along the same lines, the absolute power spectrum for the Visuo-at—
tentional period was signiﬁcantly smaller for the W (—0.18 :I: 1.80 an/Hz) than the Eb (1.7 :I: 1.26 an/Hz)
condition (p = 0.00000; F(2,222) = 20,489). The effect of the alpha ERD reinforcement in the W condition was
similarly observed in the baseline—normalized spectrogram measurement, or ERSP (dB), calculated with per—
mutation Holms corrected statistic (p < 0.05) at the C3 electrode (note the darker blue alpha band in the ERSP
template of the W condition in Fig. 2b) and on the whole scalp (Fig. 2c). In weightlessness the alpha ERD rein-
forcement extended from the parietal and occipital areas to the central contralateral areas (mu ERD) throughout
the Visuo-attentional period (Fig. 2c).

ﬂight (Eb), the maxima of alpha ERD were localized in a single midline region of the posterior cingulate cortex
(BA31, left cerebrum, —9.9, —21.3, 39.9 and BA31, right cerebrum, 14.1, —27.0 and 39.1). In contrast, in a
condition of weightlessness (W), the maxima were lateralized in the motor cortex on both sides (BA4, left cere-
brum, —25.0, — 19.9, 40.0 and BA4, right cerebrum, 28.4, — 18.0, 37.6). After the ﬂight, the single midline region

with respect to each of the three other conditions observed/measured on the ground (“W” > “Earthbefore”;
“W” > “Earthaﬁer_eaﬂy” and “W” > “Earthaﬁer_1ate”) during the Visuo-attentional period. The maxima of the alpha
ERD in the “W” > “Earthbefore” condition were localized in the anterior cingulate gyrus (BA 32, left cerebrum,
— 17.3, 10.2, 30.9), middle temporal gyrus (BA 39, left cerebrum, —33.6, —68.4, 21.4), inferior parietal lobe (right
cerebrum, BA40, 46.6, —32.4, 25.8) and cerebellum (right lobule V-VI, 5.9, —57.0, — 12.2). The maximum of
the alpha ERD in the “W” > “Earthaﬁer_eaﬂy” condition was found in the cerebellum (right lobule V, 17.3, —46.3,
—20.9), without any other equivalent maximum in the cerebral cortex. The maxima of the alpha ERD in the
“W” > “Earthaﬁer_1ate” condition were found in the cerebellum (left lobule VI, —32.4, —51.8, —22.6), anterior cin-
gulate gyrus (BA32, left cerebrum, —15.3, 9.2, 31.1) and parietal lobe (BA39, left cerebrum, —36.9, —60.4, 21.3).
It is important to note that alpha ERD was localized in the cerebellum during the weightlessness condition when
compared to pre-ﬂight and (early and late) post-ﬂight conditions.
Discussion
In spite of the importance of graViception on Earth for Visuo-motor and other aspects of motor control, the astro-
nauts’ performance remained relatively good in microgravity (refs 11,12,15—17 for a reView). Non-speciﬁc factors,
such as the noisy environment in the ISS, stress, muscle artifacts and basic physiological factors (differences in
blood circulation in both the brain and the body as a whole), seem unlikely to be the source of the alpha ERD

reinforcement here described, as we did not ﬁnd any signiﬁcant variation when exclusively analyzing the power
spectrum changes during the baseline period13’20.

During the Earth condition, at scalp level, the Visuo-attentional period was characterized by a parietal-occipital
alpha ERD. In our paradigm, the Visuo-attentional period corresponds to a low level of attention process, as the
participants were requested merely to observe the displayed scenario. This corresponds to an “exploratory state”21
or “watchfulness state”22. It was only after some seconds that the participants were required to interact by manip-
ulating a joystick in a following Visuo-motor docking. Thus the observed alpha ERD was not related to the sub-
sequent ﬁnger (pre-) movement, as this began at least two seconds later26. Source analysis showed that the alpha
ERD was localized in the posterior cingulate cortex (BA 31) consistently during all the “on Earth” conditions, i.e.
before, early-after and late-after their stay in weightlessness. Interestingly, the posterior cingulate cortex is known
to be the major node27 in the default mode network (DMN)28, whose actiVity corresponds to a state in which an
individual is awake and alert, but not actively involved in a task that requires a high level of or is goal-directedzg.
This was the case during the Visuo-attentional period. In addition, it has been hypothesized that the DMN sup-
ports a broad, low-level focus of attention when an individual monitors the external world in preparation for
up- coming, self—relevant events before they happen”. This default state must be regarded as a complex situation
involving the dynamic interplay between conscious and unconscious processes. It can be considered as a transient
equilibrium, integrating all aspects of past history for use in the future for predictionl. DMN has been related to
very slow (0.02—0.2 Hz) EEG band frequencies but also to the traditional EEG frequency bands (in the 05—45 Hz
range)30’31. Alpha oscillations have been proposed as a correlate of DMN-related processes from a functional
point of View”. States of increased attention (“exploratory state” included) and sensory perception are associated
with a decrease in alpha power, which reﬂects the release of inhibitory control“). Further, alpha rhythms have
been related to the posterior cingulate corteX during DMN actiVity33 and, together with low beta, these rhythms
are reduced in posterior regions during the “resting state with eyes open” condition34.

"6","During weightlessness, the alpha ERD signiﬁcantly increased throughout the Visuo- (low) attentional period,
mostly at the central contralateral areas at scalp level, corresponding to the mu rhythm. Source analysis revealed
that alpha-mu ERD during weightlessness was bilaterally localized in the primary motor areas. Thus in weight-
lessness, the actiVity of the DMN network that characterizes Earth condition, was outranked by the actiVity of the
motor corteX. Interestingly astronauts were asked to not execute any explicit movement at this moment. As this
is the initial period of the experimental trial after haVing accomplished the preceding one, they rather submerged
themselves in the constraint of the experiment. We speculate that the actiVity measured in the bilateral motor
corteX might be explained by the need to readjust or maintain an appropriate body posture when starting each
experimental trial. Indeed, while graVity facilitates the automaticity of postural control on the ground, astro-
nauts in the free-ﬂoating conditions aboard the 188 must continuously control their posture. The motor corteX is
involved in postural control35 and its corticospinal tract neurons respond to postural changes even when muscle
actiVity remains similar36. Postural control depends on the integration of afferent signals from the vestibular
organs with Visual, proprioceptive and tactile inputs37. Taking into account the fact that vestibular information
is reduced because of micrograVity and Visual information is restricted because of the experimental task, ﬁnding
alpha power suppression in the bilateral motor corteX may indicate a high responsiveness to somatic sensation38.
Source analysis of the alpha range that characterizes the “weightlessness” condition revealed signiﬁcant cerebellar
activation with respect to the “Earth” condition. Cerebellar involvement, documented by source reconstruction,
has been reported in other electroencephalogram investigations5’6’39. The fact that this cerebellar activation was
not identiﬁed in the source analysis of the alpha-mu ERD with respect to the baseline (i.e. period preceding the
Visual stimulus onset) suggests that it was present during the whole testing period and it is not speciﬁcally related
to the Visuo-attentional task. Alpha and beta EEG rhythms have been identiﬁed in the cerebellum, the thalamus
and a cortical network including the insula, cingulate and prefrontal corteX and show a correlation with ﬂVIRI
signal ﬂuctuations in the tonic alertness state40. Alpha oscillations in the cerebral corteX and alpha-beta oscillation
in the cerebellar corteX follow similar behaviour in relation to movement preparation“. In both cortical circuits,
the persistence of sensory or cognitive inputs is supported by neuronal membrane properties and by a recurrent
chain of neurons that act as neural integrators42. Local circuits devoted to the ‘bottom-up’ processing of infor-
mation coming from the enVironment are continuously controlled by the ‘top-down’ or ‘attentional’ inﬂuence
exerted by the permanent state of actiVity43. In addition, the long range of bidirectional communications between
the cerebral and cerebellar cortices assumes crucial functions in motor and cognitive behaviours“. The present
ﬁnding of cerebellar activation may be explained by the speciﬁc requirements of the free-ﬂoating posture and
motor program processes that involve postural stabilization and spatial orientation. It has been demonstrated in
rodents, primates and humans that cerebellar oscillations may interact with cerebral oscillations4. Oscillations in
cerebellar circuits could serve to coordinate their internal actiVity, but also to relate cerebellar actiVity to other
distant cerebral areas‘“. In this way, speciﬁc theta/beta range oscillations (4—25 Hz) of the granule cell layer in the
cerebellum have been linked to cerebral corteX actiVity45. These oscillations were ﬁrst recorded in primates while
immobile but attentive to the enVironment46. They lasted throughout the state of active or passive expectancy,
linked to somatosensory and motor corteX rhythms and decreased at the beginning of a movement‘“. As “no
movement” was explicitly required in weightlessness during this period, cerebellum alpha ERD may underlie the
correction and error signals necessary to postural stabilization while free-ﬂoating. The (right) inferior parietal
lobe (BA40), the (left) anterior cingulate gyrus (BA 32) and the (left) middle temporal gyrus (BA 39) were more
active in weightlessness than on Earth. These areas together with both cerebellar hemispheres have been identi-
ﬁed as part of the vestibular system in humans47 which is altered in weightlessness”. The alpha ERD recorded in
this network may reﬂect a challenge of an increased demand to integrate partially reduced or incongruent vestib-
ular information while free-ﬂoatingzo. From another point of View, an increased non spatial attentional demand
in weightlessness corresponding to the task switching between the actual “Visuo-attentional” and the subsequent
“Visuo-motor” periods or to the trial history due to the repetitive character of the task48 cannot be excluded as
these regions also participate to the ventral attention system49.

Conclusion

An alpha ERD potentiation was consistently observed in micrograVity while executing a low-level
Visuo-attentional task. The bilateral motor corteX was involved in this effect, probably responding to the high
demands of continuous readjustment or maintenance of an appropriate body posture while free-ﬂoating. In addi-
tion, the condition of micrograVity was characterized by an alpha ERD in the cerebellum and other areas of the
vestibular system, which might underlie the correction and error signals necessary for postural stabilization while
free-ﬂoating as well as the increased demand to integrate partially reduced or incongruent vestibular information.
Methods

Participants. Five male astronauts (54.2 :I: 2.6 years old) participated in this investigation. They were in excel-
lent health, as regularly determined by a special medical commission throughout the experiment. Each astronaut
was tested on the ground before ﬂight, in weightlessness aboard the International Space Station (188) and on the
ground after his return on Earth. The investigation was performed during the joint European-USA—Canadian
Expeditions 20—21 and 34—35, and the joint European-USA Expeditions 26—27 and 30—31. All the missions
involved a siX-month long stay in orbit. The astronauts reported their use of medication and sleep quality.

The European Space Agency Medical Care Committee and the NASA Johnson Space Centre Institutional
Review Board for Human Testing approved all experimental procedures, which were performed in accordance
with the Helsinki Declaration of 1964. All participants gave written, informed consent prior to starting the
experiment.

The detailed testing schedule was as follows. Prior to any EEG data recording, the astronauts got familiar-
ized with the experimental tasks during two sessions of 60 min., separated by at least siX days. The ﬁrst EEG

"7","data collection took place at 66.8 :I: 9.0 days before launch. This ﬁrst session served as a general rehearsal and as
one session’s worth of data to be used as back-up, if needed. Then, the astronauts were tested twice on Earth at
42.6 :I: 0.9 and 28.0 :I: 0.4 days before lift-of (“Earthbeforf or “Eb”), twice during weightlessness aboard the 188 at
8.8 :I: 1.8 and 54.6 :I: 3.7 days of space ﬂight (“Weightlessness” or “W”) and four times after their return (“Earthaﬁef
or “Eaﬁer”), twice early at 3.0 :I: 0.4 and 7.0 :I: 1.2 days (“Earthaﬁepeaﬂy”) and twice later at 16.8 :I: 0.64 and 20.2 :I: 1.04
days following their landing (“Earthaﬁer_late”). The astronauts’ recordings on Earthbefore and Earthaﬁer were thus used
as their own controls.

Experimental set-Up. Similar to previous space mission investigations13’20, the participants were told to
look straight ahead at a laptop screen through a form-ﬁtting facemask, ﬁtted with a cylindrical Viewing tube that
removed external Visual cues. The screen was centred on the line of sight, at a distance of ~30 cm from the eyes.
The facemask was held ﬁrmly in place by a strap that passed behind the head. A joypad was mounted vertically
on the right side of the cylindrical tube, allowing the participants to hold on to the entire structure (mask/tube/
laptop) with both hands and still manipulate the joystick and press the buttons on the joypad with right thumb
and right indeX ﬁnger.

On Earth, the participants performed the experiment while seated comfortably in front of the computer,
which rested on a support table. The facemask was at eye level. During weightlessness in space ﬂight, they per-
formed the experiment in a free-ﬂoating condition. In order to restrain large shifts of trajectory, a belt was
put around the subject’s waist and then attached to straps ﬁxed by metal rings to the right and left racks of the
Columbus module of the ISS.

Stimuli and task. The participants observed a Virtual environment displayed on the computer screen that
simulated one of two scenarios: that of piloting a space ship towards the 188 or that of controlling a space ship
from the 188. In both randomly presented scenarios, their goal was to match positions between spaceship and 188.
There were 80 trials per session (40 for each scenario) and each trial lasted 15 seconds maximum. The 80 trials
were divided in four blocks, which allowed the astronaut can take a break before starting the next block of 20
trials. At the beginning of each trial, the image of the space ship (or 188) was presented ﬁrst and the image of the
188 (or spaceship) one second after. One second after, the target deviated from the nominal straight-ahead posi-
tion for two seconds. Throughout this ﬁrst period (total duration of 4 seconds), the subject was asked to observe
the space ship (or 188) without performing any movement. In the present study, we report the EEG responses
during this ﬁrst “Visuo-attentional” period. SiX seconds after the presentation of the ﬁrst image, the centre of the
space ship (or 188) subtly, but quite perceptibly, changed from white to grey, which indicated that the subject was
required to take control of the spaceship and perform as quickly as possible (seven seconds maximum), and make
the best possible manual adjustment to the space’s ship trajectory toward the target by pressing on a small joystick
operated with the right indeX ﬁnger. Once the subject considered that he had matched the positions of both craft
as closely as possible, he pressed a button on the joypad with his thumb. The centre of the space ship changed from
white to blue or to yellow, depending whether the positions were matched acceptably (precision 3 mm) or not.
The next trial started two seconds later. The entire second part constituted the “Visuo-motor” period.

EEG recordings. The EEG was recorded at a sampling rate of 1116 Hz (0.01—558 Hz band width) using the
multi-electrode electroencephalogram mapping module (M.E.E.M.M) from the European physiology module
installed in the Columbus module of the 188, at the European Astronaut Centre (Koln, Germany) or in Star City
(Moscow). In addition to the 58 EEG electrodes (from EEG cap with 10—20 electrode system placement), three
electrooculogram (for horizontal and vertical EOG), one electrocardiogram and one electromyogram (from the
ﬁrst interosseous muscle of the right hand) signals were recorded. For some of the post-ﬂight recordings at the
Johnson Space Centre (Houston), the ANT system (The Netherlands) was used with a sampling frequency of
2048 Hz and with a resolution of 22 bits (71.5 nV per bit). An active-shield cap using 64 Ag/AgCl sintered ring
electrodes and shielded co-aXial cables (10—20 electrode system placements) was comfortably adjusted to the
subject’s head.

All the electrodes were referred to the right earlobe. Scalp electrode impedances were measured and
kept below 5 KS). Off—line, data treatment was performed using EEGlab50, ASA software (ANT system, The
Netherlands) and in-house MATLAB-based tools.

The data were ﬁrstly resampled to a 512 Hz and the DC offset was removed. We analysed the single EEG trials
(80 trials/session X 5 participants X 2 sessions per condition). Ocular artefacts were detected and removed by
using the PCA method in ASA software where 95% of the calculated component explained the noise subspace.
Any other remaining artefacts were rejected by careful Visual inspection (no more than 8% of the total trials were
eliminated). Each EEG trial contained samples from — 1s before to 4 s after the ﬁrst stimulus (space ship image)
onset (“Visuo-attentional” period).

Event-related spectral perturbation. We used the EEGlab software for the time-frequency analysis of
EEG oscillations. We calculated the baseline-normalized spectrogram or event-related spectral perturbation51
(ERSP in dB) for each of the 58 EEG signals, for each subject. ERSP measures variations in the power spectrum
at speciﬁc frequency ranges of ongoing rhythms. These variations are related to the speciﬁc aspect of information
processing that is time-locked to stimulus. We used wavelet transform for complex spectro-temporal representa-
tion, with Hanning-windowed sinusoidal wavelets at 3 cycles (lowest) to 25 cycles (highest). ERSP templates
were calculated with 500 time points, using a window size of 571 samples (1115.23 ms) wide and estimating
100 frequencies from 3—50 Hz. For the signiﬁcance level of ERSP bootstrap, resampling (p < 0.05) was used as
a surrogate method. The signiﬁcance between experimental conditions was calculated by permutation analysis
(p > 0.05), with the Holms method for the correction of multiple comparisons52 (Fig. 2b,c).

"8","We also calculated the absolute power spectrum values (FFT length of 512 data points) speciﬁcally for the

frequency band of interest in each individual subject (5 bins in the alpha range) in the C3 EEG representative
channel, separately for the baseline period (— Is to 0 s) and for the period after the ﬁrst stimulus (space ship
image) onset (0 s to 4 s), which we named the Visuo-attentional period. We then calculated the subtraction of the
obtained values in the baseline and Visuo-attentional periods, yielding in the ERD estimations (an/Hz) :I: s.e.m.).
We made a statistical comparison of the measurements performed before the ﬂight (“Earthbefore”), in ﬂight (W)
and after the ﬂight (“Earthaﬁer”) with a single-factor ANOVA test with 3 levels and Bonferroni for correction of
multiple comparisons (Fig. 2).
Time-frequency source analysis. This method has been described in detail before24’25. We focused on the
brain areas that eXhibit ERSP around the frequency band of interest (speciﬁc for each subject). The analytic signal
at the target centre frequency was ﬁrst calculated for each EEG sensor channel for the nth trial of the experiment.
We applied swLORETA53 (Standardized Weighted Low Resolution Electromagnetic Tomography which is based
on sLORETA54) to the analytic signals for each individual trial; swLORETA has enabled the accurate reconstruc-
tion of surface and deep current sources in simulated data even in the presence of noise and when two dipoles are
simultaneously actives, by incorporating a singular value, decomposition-based lead ﬁeld weighting that com-
pensates for the varying sensitivity of the sensors to current sources at different depths. The ERPS in brain space
over the n trials were then calculated, as proposed by Lin et 011.55. The solution was computed using 2030 voxels
(5.00-mm grid spacing) and was restricted to the grey matter of the cerebrum and cerebellum based on the proba-
bilistic brain tissue maps available from the MNI. The solution was computed during the 4 s after the ﬁrst stimulus
onset, referred to as the “active period” or “Visuo-attentional period”, and during the baseline period (— 1s before
the “stimulus onset), referred to as the “reference period”. Finally, voxels and the recording array (electrodes) were
placed in registration with the Collins 27 MRI produced by the Montreal Neurological Institute56. The Boundary
Element Model (BEM) was used for solving the forward problem. Talairach coordinates were obtained for every
voxel by placing the corresponding Talairach markers onto the Collins anatomical template”. The ﬁnal coordi-
nates 0f the maxima values (X,y,z, Talairach coordinates) we provided for labelling the corresponding brain areas
were based on the Talairach atlas.

For our statistical analysis, we used the nonparametric permutation method58 to identify the ERSP sources”.
As a ﬁrst step, we used the classical baseline period preceding the stimulation as a reference (1 s before stimulus
onset) and the “Visuo-attentional” period as the active condition (4 s after the stimulus onset) in order to calculate
nonparametric statistic maps, which represent speciﬁc brain sources of the ERSP in each condition (“Earthbefore’i
“W”, “Earthafter_early” and “Earthafter_late”) for the whole population. In a second step, we computed nonpara-
metric statistic maps comparing the “Visual-attentional” periods of each condition. This allowed us to specify
which sources were more active in the condition of weightlessness (“W” > “Earthbefore”; “W” > “Earthaﬁer_ear1y”;
“W” > “Earthaﬁer_late”) for characterizing this contextual “brain state” (weightlessness versus 0n the ground).

We used paired t-test for swLORETA solutions to compare the active versus reference conditions in each
subject, with a null hypothesis corresponding to the absence of difference between the active and reference condi-
tions, which is equivalent to stating that the distribution of the voxel values of the participants’ difference inverse
solution images has a zero mean. We used the 95th percentile of the permutation distribution for the maximal
statistics which deﬁnes the 0.05 level of the corrected signiﬁcance threshold. In other words, we can reject the
null hypothesis for any voxel with t-Values 0f the un-permuted T image greater than the 95th percentile of the
permutation distribution of the maximal statistics58.
