The ability of the Allan variance to identify
and estimate the typical Clock noises is widely
accepted, and its use is recommended in international
standards [14]. The DAVAR extends those features
and adds the possibility of identifying and interpreting
nonstationary effects. The DAVAR has raised a certain
interest in applications to space and satellite systems,
in particular in monitoring the Clocks 0f the Global
Positioning System (GPS) [19], in the frame of the
European Galileo project [13, 25], and in the NASA
exploration of deep space [18]. The application of
the Allan variance and the DAVAR to these contexts
requires particular care, at least because of two effects.
