Abstract

The dried, ﬂeshy stems of Cistanche deserticola (Orobanchaceae) are popular tonics in Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) to treat
the inability of kidney in expelling extra ﬂuid in the body, causing ﬂuid retention, and reform reproductive system. However, the wild
plants of C. deserticola have become endangered due to habitat downsizing and over—harvesting for its medicinal usages. The present
research was carried out for the following purposes: (1) promoting the space—breeding research; (2) providing molecular evidence for
agricultural selective breeding; and (3) protecting this endangered herbal medicine and conserving its genetic resources.

In this study, plants were cultivated from seeds speciﬁcally treated in spaceﬂight for seven days, and sampled to screen positive
mutants and identify ISSR markers associated with their medicinal constituents. As a result, nine out of the 94 ISSR primers were
showed high polymorphism, and a total of 118 bands were generated, of which 80 were polymorphic, ranging from 250 to 2600 bp.
The spaceﬂight mutants were found to have lower coeﬂicient of gene differentiation (Gst : 0.0269), and higher gene ﬂow
(Nm : 18.0740) than those of the controls (Gst : 0.2067 and Nm : 1.9185). The results demonstrated that most of the genetic variation
were harnessed within populations (>97%). The Analysis of Molecular Variance (AMOVA) revealed high genetic variation within pop—
ulations (88.03%) and low genetic differentiation among regions (—18.83%) and populations (30.79%), respectively. The results also indi—
cated a profound difference between spaceﬂight condition and that on the earth. The unique vacuum environment of spaceﬂight was
suggested to induce DNA mutation and various variations of C. deserticola. In addition, siX particular ISSR markers were identiﬁed,
Cloned and sequenced; one of them, CA41939—934, was found positively correlated with acteoside with correlation coeﬂicient values
of 0.264 (P < 0.05). Our work may provide a valuable molecular evidence for establishing conservation strategies and space—breeding
research program.
