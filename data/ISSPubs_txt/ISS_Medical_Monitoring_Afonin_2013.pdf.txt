Abstract—A comparative analysis of the excretory and incretory activity of the stomach and pancreas in

astronauts soon after completion of space ﬂights ofyarious durations was performed. An increase in the fast—

ing activity of gastric and pancreatic enzymes and hormones (insulin and C—peptide) in blood, reﬂecting the

increased excretory and incretory activity of organs of the gastroduodenal region developing in microgravity,

was demonstrated. The absence of subjects infected with Helicobacterpylori in the space ﬂight crew excluded

the involvement of this microorganism in the mechanism underlying the increase in the gastric secretory

activity The absence of correlation between the increase in the secretory activity of organs of the gas—

troduodenal region and the duration of the space ﬂight allowed us to rule out the hypokinetic mechanism,

which is associated with the duration of exposure to microgravity It was concluded that the main mechanism

underlying the changes in the functional state of the digestive system in space ﬂight may be determined by the

rearrangement of the venous hemodynamics of organs of the abdominal caVity, unrelated to the duration of

exposure to microgravity It was shown that, after completion of space ﬂights and in ground—based experi—

ments simulating the hemodynamic rearrangement occurring in microgravity, the increase in the basal excre—

tory activity of gastroduodenal organs was not caused by gastrin secretion and occurred simultaneously with

an increase in the secretion of insulin, which is considered as a putative hormonal component of the hemo—

dynamic mechanism.
