Abstract
We present here the results of chlorophyll—a (chl—a) concentration estimation using the red and
near infrared (NIR) spectral bands of a Hyperspectral Imager for the Coastal Ocean (HICO) in
productive turbid waters of the Azov Sea, Russia. During the data collection campaign in the
summer of 2010 in Taganrog Bay and the Azov Sea, water samples were collected and
concentrations of chl—a were measured analytically. The NIR—red models were tuned to
optimize the spectral band selections and chl—a concentrations were retrieved from HICO data.
The NIR—red three—band model with HICO—retrieved reﬂectances at wavelengths 684, 700, and
720 nm explained more than 85% 0f chl—a concentration variation in the range from 19.67 to
93.14 mg m—3 and was able to estimate chl—a with root mean square error below 10 mg m_3.
The results indicate the high potential of HICO data to estimate chl—a concentration in turbid
productive (Case 11) waters in real—time, which will be of immense value to scientists, natural
resource managers, and decision makers involved in managing the inland and coastal aquatic
ecosystems.
