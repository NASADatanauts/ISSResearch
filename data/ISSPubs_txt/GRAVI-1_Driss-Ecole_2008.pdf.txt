then subjected to centrifugal accelerations ranging from 1.2 x 10—2 g to
2.0 x 10—2 gfor 9 h. In both cases, root orientation and root curvature were
followed by time-lapse photography. Still images were downlinked in near real
time to ground Norwegian User Support and Operations Center during the
experiment. The position of the roottip and the root curvature were analyzed as
a function of time. It has been shown that in microgravity, the embryonic root
curved strongly away from the cotyledons (automorphogenesis) and then
straightened out slowly from 17 to 30 h following hydration (autotropism).
Because of the autotropic straightening of roots in microgravity, their tip was
oriented at an angle Close to the optimal angle of curvature (1200—1350) for
a period of 2 h during centrifugation. Moreover, it has been demonstrated that
lentil roots grown in microgravity before stimulation were more sensitive than
roots grown in 1 g. In these conditions, the threshold acceleration perceived by
these organs was found to be between 0 and 2.0 x 10—3 g and estimated
punctually at 1.4 x 10—5 g by using the hyperbolic model for fitting the
experimental data and by assuming that autotropism had no or little impact on
the gravitropic response. Gravisensing by statoliths should be possible at such
a low level of acceleration because the actomyosin system could provide the
necessary work to overcome the activation energy for gravisensing.
