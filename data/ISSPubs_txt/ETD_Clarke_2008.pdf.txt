CHAPTER 4.10
Listing’s plane and the otolith-mediated
graV1ty vector

Abstract: The orientation of Listing’s plane (LP) was examined under one-g and zero-g conditions during
parabolic ﬂight and during prolonged spaceﬂight. Ten healthy subjects participated in the parabolic ﬂight
study. In zero-g, the orientation of LP was consistently altered. LP elevation was tilted backwards by
approximately 100 (p = 0.003). The azimuth angles of the left and right eyes also diverged in zero-g, with a
statistically signiﬁcant change (p = 0.04) in the vergence angle between 6.10 and 11.80. A discernible
dissociation in torsional eye position was also observed, which proved to be statistically signiﬁcant
(p = 0.03). The thickness of LP was found to be of the order of lo, and was not signiﬁcantly altered by the
transitions between one-g and zero-g. The results of the spaceﬂight measurements demonstrate that this LP
re-orientation persists over 6-month periods in microgravity, and that re-adaptation after returning to one-
g earthbound conditions proceeds over several days to weeks. The ﬁndings demonstrate that in contrast to
repositioning of the head in one-g, the elimination of gravity represents a qualitative change for the
vestibular and oculomotor systems. It appears that given the lack of voluntary control of ocular torsion, the
tonic otolith inputs are instrumental in the stabilization of torsional eye position and consequently of LP.
The observed torsional divergence also provides support for the so-ealled otolith asymmetry hypothesis.
