Abstract
Conducting space experiments with small budgets is afaet oflifefor many design groups with low-visibility
science programs. One major consequence is that specialized space grade electronic components are often
too costly to incorporate into the design. Radiation mitigation now becomes more complex as a result of
being restricted to the use Ofcommereial off-the-shelf (COTS) parts. Unique hardware and software
design techniques are required to succeed in producing a viable instrument suitedfor use in space. This
paper highlights some of the design challenges and associated solutions encountered in the production ofa
highly capable, low cost space experimentpaekage.
Introduction
The Forward Technology Solar Cell Experiment (FTSCE) is a space solar cell
experiment built as part of the Fifth Materials on the International Space Station
Experiment (MISSE-S). It represents a collaborative effort between NASA Glenn
Research Center (GRC), the Naval Research Laboratory (NRL) and the US Naval
Academy (USNA). The purpose of this experiment is to place current and future solar
cell technologies on orbit Where they Will be characterized and validated. This is in
response to recent on orbit and ground test results Which have raised concerns about the
in space survivability of new solar cell technologies and about current ground test
methodology.1 The various components of the FTSCE are assembled into the passive
experiment container (PEC) which is a 2’X 2’ X 4” folding metal container that Will be
attached to the outer structure of the international space station (188) by an astronaut.
Test data is transmitted to Earth and stored in on-board baek-up memory. At the end of a
nominal one year mission, the PEC Will be removed and returned to Earth. The
experiment is designed to remain in orbit for two and a half years if the situation arises.
MISSE-S hardware overview
MISSE-S is placed in a PEC used to ﬂy space environment samples to space and back
(ﬁgure 1). It is attached to the exterior of the 188 during an extravehieular activity (EVA)
to expose samples to space. For MISSES, these samples are 39 advanced technology
solar cells positioned on the side of the PEC that faces the sun (figure 2). The
technologies include state-of—the-art and next generation multijunetion InGaP/GaAs/Ge,
heteroepitaxial GaAs/GeSi/Ge, and amorphous Si and CuIn(Ga)Se2 thin ﬁlm solar cells.2

In addition to these cells are a number of other sensors to include two-element position
sensitive diodes for sun position sensing, single point solar cells for radiance and sun
position sensing and temperature sensors in the form of resistance temperature devices
(RTD) and three terminal temperature sensors from Analog Devices (ADS 90). The
electronics assembly to interrogate these sensors and to communicate With the second
prototype communication satellite system (PCSAT2) has been provided by NASA GRC
personnel. The PCSAT2 communication system Will be used to telemeter test data to
Earth and t0 telemeter command and control from earth to the NASA GRC electronics
using the International Telecommunication Union (ITU) Amateur Satellite Service. In
the event of a communications failure, the NASA GRC electronics Will continue to
operate in a stand alone mode, taking data according to time, temperature and sun
position schedule. Data normally sent to earth Will also be archived in 0n—b0ard ﬂash
memory. The PEC Will be recovered in a year or two during a subsequent EVA and
returned to earth Where its data can be downloaded from the ﬂash memory. The NASA
GRC electronics are made up of the main microcontroller board , or “mother board”
Which is numbered board 0 and nine data acquisition boards “daughter boards” numbered
1 through 9 (ﬁgure 3).
Mother board hardware
The mother board is centered about a core borrowed from the Mars array technology
experiment (MATE)3 and the dust accumulation and removal technology experiment
(DART). 4’5 These experiment packages from the scrubbed Mars 2001 mission were
designed, qualiﬁed and shipped to ﬂy by the same NASA GRC personnel. This core is
made up of an 80C32E radiation tolerant (rad-tolerant) microcontroller from Temic (now
Atmel), a radiation hardened (rad-hard) 8KX8, 67164 RAM from UTMC (now Aeroﬂex)
and a rad-hard 32KX8 28F256 EEPROM from SEi (now Maxwell). Supporting this core
is 54AC glue logic from National Which is single event latch-up (SEL) immune With a

engineers and technicians at NASA Glenn Research Center

linear energy transfer (LET) greater than 120 and single event upset (SEU) immune With
a LET in the range of 40 to 60. 6’7 The expected mission environmental speciﬁcation is
given at an LET of 37. Total dose is not an issue With shielding because radiation levels
fall below 1 Krad-Si (1 rad-Si=100 ergs/grams of silicon).8’9 The microcontroller is rad-tolerant
such that it is latch-up hard to a LET greater than 120 but is SEU hard only up to a LET
of 5. Testing at Temic showed that SEUs can occur in the 80C32E’s RAM. Mitigation
for this upset has been effected by placing all possible RAM operations, speciﬁcally
microcontroller state information, in the hard external RAM, and by a triple modular
redundant (TMR) power-up, brownout, watchdog-timer reset circuit (ﬁgure 4). Thus, if
the 80C32E gets lost, either internally or through SEUs in the glue logic, it Will be reset
and forced into a cleansing reboot. The 80C32E can endure a total dose exceeding 100
Krad-Si.10
The 8KX8, 67164 RAM from UTMC is rad-hard under speciﬁed operating conditions to
endure a total dose of 1 Mrad-Si, to be free from latchup and to have a SEU rate of about
10'13 errors/ bit-day.11 Data is scratch padded in the RAM and the state of the
microcontroller is stored there as mentioned earlier. As further brown out mitigation, we
have experimentally shown that the device retains its contents down to Vdd = 2 volts
indeﬁnitely and also does so repeatedly for 37 m8 excursions down to Vdd = 0.7 volts.
Therefore, the 32KX8 28F256 EEPROM from SEi is considered rad-hard for this mission.
Its SEL and SEU thresholds exceed a LET of 120. It can also endure a total dose over
100 Krad-Si.12 It is only susceptible during write operations (SEU LET=20) but no
writes shall be effected during ﬂight. The 28F25 6 stores the program memory and data
ﬁelds for the mission. Beyond the microcontroller core is the power-up, brownout,
watchdog-timer reset circuit, the power switching for the daughter boards, the serial
communications multiplexer and level translators for the daughter boards, the ground

This function is to keep the microcontroller from doing anything foolish (such as errant
writes to RAM) while in a brown-out state. A maj ority of slices must agree on a brown-
out reset for one to be issued. Each slice contains a watoh-dog timeout function. The
miorooontroller must perform 10 sequential write operations to the memory address
uniquely associated with each watoh-dog during a 1.4 second period in order to prevent a
timeout. If two or more watoh-dogs timeout, a 1 second reset will be issued.
Power switching for the daughter boards is accomplished by a nine bit pattern. A tri-state
shift register is loaded with a ‘0’ in each location corresponding to a daughter board
chosen for power-up. Thus, boards can be selectively switched on or off. To conserve
power, and to reduce the probability of SEUs under bias, all daughter boards are naturally
powered down. During operations any subset of boards may be powered up depending
on the state of operations and on the state of daughter board health. For example, every
ten minutes temperature data is taken. Only the boards possessing temperature sensors
need to be powered up. Also, if the microcontroller notices that a board is ﬂakey or non-
operational, it can be masked off and permanently precluded from power up. The shift
register is made up of a quad 2-input NAND gate (54AC00), an ootal d-type ﬂip—ﬂop
(54AC3 74) and an ootal transceiver (54AC245). The daughter board power up signal
line is pulled up to +16 volt (+12 volt nominal) and is diode protected. To power up the
daughter board, this signal must be pulled to ground. Power switch signal level shifting is
effected by a XP04311 dual NPN/PNP transistor array connected to each bit in the shift
register and to its corresponding daughter board.
The twin ﬂash memory banks are made up of two K9F3208WOA, 4MX8 NAND ﬂash
memories. This is an “end-of—life” part from Samsung which was the result of a
renaming of the KM29W3200. The KM29W3200 is the extended voltage (2.7 to 5) volt
version of the KM29N32000. The KM29N32000 was radiation tested by Maxwell and
found to be hard to a total dose of 4.45 KRAD biased and 21 Krad-Si unbiased and to
have an SEL LET and SEU LET of > 60.13 The K9F3208WOA is of the same process as
the KM29N3200 and can operate at a lower voltage. Thus we cannot guarantee that they
will operate the same as the KM29N3200 in a radiation environment, but we are
comfortable enough to design it into the system redundantly with power down control
and circuit isolation. Every ﬁfteenth data set acquired from the daughter boards is
written to both ﬂashes. It is only at this time, about once per day, that the ﬂashes are
under bias. Two are used as a redundant measure should any upsets occur during a write
operation. The ﬂash is capable of storing 2.4 years of mission data.
The serial communication multiplexer permits only one communication channel to be
open at a time. A four bit pattern is written to two MUX16, J FET multiplexers; one for
transmit and one for receive. The MUX16, using bipolar and J FET technology, is rad-
hard for this application. Furthermore, the MUX16 requires a Vdd which is a minimum
of 4 volts greater than the largest signal it will have to pass. Thus, it is powered by the
switched +16 volt (+12 nominal) bus. The daughter boards use 3.3 volt CMOS levels for
serial communication therefore transceivers are not used to link to the microcontroller.
On the other hand, the GSE and PCSAT2 require 2VN3310 MOSFETS and 2N2222

The GSE and PCSAT2 are paralleled off of the same channel as there shall never be a
case where both are attached to the system simultaneously. Thus, GSE operations can be
carried out with mother board not knowing if it is GSE 0r PCSAT2 to which it is
communicating. This allows us to use the same software for ground and ﬂight activities.

Daughter board hardware
There are nine daughter boards. Each is capable of autonomously acquiring 32 point I-V
curves from each of four separate solar cells. Each board can also support a two-element
position sensitive diode for sun position sensing and a combination of single point solar
cells for radiance and sun position sensing and temperature sensors in the form of RTDs
and AD590s. The daughter board cored is a C8051F006 mieroeontroller by Cygnal,
which is not a ﬂight grade part. Conversations with an application engineer at Cygnal
revealed that they have not been able to force the part into a full scale latch-up, but have
been able to create local lateh-ups at output pins if those pins were required to source or
sink over 20 111A. No such occurrences were destructive to the part nor did they
otherwise disrupt program execution. The local events could be corrected by removing
current from the pin or from the part. With this in mind, care was taken to resistively
protect each output such that there would never be a source or sink condition over 10

microcontroller and +7.5 volts t0 the DG406 analog multiplexer and t0 the analog section
consisting of primarily of LT1014ISW quad operational ampliﬁers (opamps). These
ampliﬁers are bipolar amplifiers and are parametrieally sound up to Krad-Si levels.
During power down, a MOSFET circuit automatically switches a shunt resistor across
each cell to keep it under constant load (ﬁgure 6). Thus, during non-operation, each cell
is still sourcing current. In the event that a board fails to be powered up for some reason,
at a minimum, the cell will have been aged under load stress and purposeful post ﬂight
evaluation can be conducted. At power-up, the microcontroller must actively disable this
function to allow for I-V curve generation.
A brown out detect circuit is connected to the LT1153 circuit to remove power to the
microcontroller in the event that the +16 (+12 volt nominal) rail drops lower than +9.5
volts which is the lower limit for +7.5 volt analog power regulation (ﬁgure 7). Also at
power-up, the microcontroller does a self check to include RAM test and program
memory checksum. The results of this test are queried by the mother board during the
initiation of serial communications. If an error is detected, the mother board may, Via
ground command, mask it off from future power-up cycles, deeming it a very bad board.
Each daughter board can perform a 32 point I-V curve on each of four separate solar
cells. Unlike the I-V curve circuit in MATE, which used a current source to pump the

cell, the circuit in the daughter board simply has a series MOSFET and low ohm sense
resistor across the cell (figure 8).
Digital to analog converter outputs from the microcontroller are ampliﬁed by an opamp
circuit to provide bias to the MOSFET gate. A difference ampliﬁer across the sense
resistor provides a voltage analogous to the current sourced by the cell. The sense
resistor is referenced to ground and is in the source circuit of the MOSFET. This
provides negative feedback against self heating induced ﬂuctuations in the channel
resistance vs. gate to source voltage function. A voltage divider/opamp buffer across
each cell provides a voltage analogous to the voltage across the cell (ﬁgure 6). While
sweeping the digital to analog converter voltage, the microcontroller simultaneously
performs analog to digital conversions (ADC) 0n the current and voltage sense signals
and creates the I-V curves. The gain and divider component values for the current sense
circuits and the voltage sense circuits are chosen to reﬂect the short circuit current and
the open circuit voltage of the cell 011 each channel. Resistor values are chosen to exploit
the full ADC range of the microcontroller for each cell.

thereby producing a total of fourteen analog channels. The DG406 was chosen because it
Will run on the single supply voltage of +7.5 volts and also because it is an epitaxial
CMOS part Which is expected to be latch-up resistant. If the LT1 15 3 senses a current of

power Will be removed from the DG406.
A versatile two opamp circuit on the daughter board can be adapted to support two
AD590 temperature sensors, two single point solar cells, one of each of the
aforementioned or a single three Wire measurement on an RTD (ﬁgure 9). The inclusion,
omission and/or component value choices determine the circuit function. Temperature
measurements are important as they give a thermal proﬁle against Which the aging of the
cells has occurred. Temperature measurements are taken every 50 seconds and stored
every 10 minutes While I-V curves are taken approximately every 90 minutes or once per
orbit. Single point solar cells are used for back—up sun position sensing and for
radiometry.
Another two opamp circuit is included to condition the signals from a two element
position sensitive photodiode (PSD) for sun position determination (ﬁgure 10). The PSD
elements are back biased by one diode drop to keep the device from forward biasing itself
When high output currents drive its rather large series impedance. The opamps run in the
transimpedance mode. A single forward biased diode shared by each amp’s non-inverting
input imposes a reverse bias at each inverting input’s summing junction. The diode
voltage is read by the microcontroller along With the IR value of the transimpedanee
amps. In this manner, the diode drop, now summed to the transimpedance values, can be
subtracted from each signal by the microcontroller.

are two sensor channels designed to support three different types of temperature sensor
(AD590, th, shorted cell). Lastly, four sensor channels are dedicated for reading sun
position sensors. The multipurpose nature of these boards requires supporting software
that allows for easy transition between many available sensor conﬁgurations.
Consequently, the software is constructed with conﬁguration blocks that deﬁne the on-
board hardware, calibration scale factors and health check information for each of the
nine ﬂight boards and two laboratory boards. Any of these board setups is easily
selectable and the information within the individual board conﬁgurations is readily
available for customization.
The function of the main program is to query the serial port at a standard 9600 baud rate
for commands sent by the mother board and perform the requested action. Its structure is
illustrated by the ﬂowchart in ﬁgure 11. A11 serial transfers start with a header byte of

to a variety of solar cells and stores the information in memory. The third command
requests the serial transfer of the temperature, sun position and health data. Finally, the
forth command requests the serial transfer of all data stored in memory. An error

program performs a RAM memory cheek and a ROM memory check. The temperature

After experimenting With the n-ehannel FET serving as a variable resistance load for IV

regions of the IV curve are spurious. Furthermore, the relationship between the FET gate
voltage and the channel resistance in non-linear. Fortunately, these issues can be resolved
with some software mitigation illustrated by the ﬂowchart in ﬁgure 13. Initially, all of
the solar cells are continuously held under load with a ﬁxed resistor that can be switched
in or out of the circuit. The experiment begins by unloading the cell being tested and
driving the FET completely off thereby ﬂoating the cells. After waiting 50 milliseconds
for the drive circuitry to settle, a current reading (Ioffset) is taken to record the offset
value that must be removed from all subsequent current readings. This presumes that the
maj or contribution of the current at this load point is from offsets in the signal ampliﬁer
stages and not from the cell current through the open FET channel. Next, the FET is
driven to the completely on state thereby shorting the solar cell. As mentioned earlier, it
was discovered that Isc causes heating within the FET which in turn alters the on
resistance. If the FET junction temperature was not allowed to reach equilibrium before
acquiring data, improper current readings were obtained. However, if an adequate
waiting period for temperature stabilization was afforded (between 500 and 900
milliseconds), accurate, repeatable current readings were obtained. This program allows
a full second before proceeding with current readings. Another assumption is that the
FET has enough thermal mass to allow for the readings past the max power point to occur
before junction cooling effects impact the data. After shorting the cell, either ISO is read
or a value is manually entered and stored in memory. All subsequent points on the IV
curve are driven by a table in ROM that selects the desired current points as a

DAC to drive the gate of the FET, through some buffer circuitry, such that the FET
channel resistance produces cell currents as close as resolvable to the desired values.
This procedure is illustrated by the ﬂowchart in ﬁgure 14. With each change in cell
current, the cell voltage is monitored ten times within a 50 millisecond time block. If the
deviation within these ten samples is acceptable, the data point is considered stable and
the current/voltage data pair is recorded in memory. On the other hand, if the voltage
deviation is out of the speciﬁed range, another data point is taken 5 milliseconds later and
the oldest data point within the ten point sample is discarded. A new deviation is then
calculated and the process repeated. If after 800 milliseconds an acceptable deviation
within the window of ten data points is not attained, the most recent current/voltage data
pair is recorded in memory and ﬂagged as unstable. This process is illustrated by the
ﬂowchart in ﬁgure 15.

Each acquisition that results in data stored to memory is actually the mean of twenty
readings taken at 1 microsecond intervals. This procedure is illustrated by the ﬂowchart
in ﬁgure 16. After 32 current/voltage pairs have been acquired, the FET is turned fully
off and the ﬁxed load resister is reactivated. All data, with the exception of the
temperature data, is output as a calibrated 12-bit ADC value that requires the proper scale
factor and reference voltage to determine the actual sensor output. This also includes the
current values sent to manually request a speciﬁc ISC which must be converted from
amperes to a 12-bit ADC value based on a current scale factor and the voltage reference.
These scale factors, as shown in table 1, encompass the gains from the signal
conditioning circuitry on the board and within the microcontroller. In contrast, the

the type of temperature sensor (ﬁgure 12).
The daughter boards have limited ability to detect total dose radiation damage and single
event upsets “SEU”. The initial random access memory “RAM” and read-cnly memory
“ROM” tests check for permanently damaged memory cells which can be an indicator of
total dose effects. These tests also check for transient bit ﬂips which could be an
indicator of a SEU. During serial data transfers, the CRC allows for the detection and
correction of single bit errors which again might indicate a SEU. If any of the nine
daughter boards continuously fail the RAM and ROM tests after a cold start, it is
considered unﬁt for service. The mother board can then remove the suspect board from
the task queue.
Mother board ﬁrmware
The software is designed to autonomously take data when user deﬁned conditions of sun
angle and temperature are met. Also, the experiment can be commanded to measure on
demand. Also, each daughter board can be commanded individually with a speciﬁc set of
measurement criteria. This grants the scientists on the ground ﬂexibility in customizing
experimental data sets. For example, the daughter boards can be commanded to measure
data once the sun angle is below a set threshold, which allows IV data vs angle of
incidence data to be generated. Alternatively, the daughter boards can be commanded to
measure once the temperature has exceeded a set threshold value, which allows IV data
vs. temperature to be generated. The software resident on the main microprocessor board

PCSatZ, decoding the commands, and passing the appropriate commands to the daughter
boards. The main microprocessor software must also take the data from the nine
daughter boards, translate it into printable ASCII characters and pass it to the TNC for
down-linking by PCSat2. The main microprocessor software must also “oversee” the
autonomous operation of the experiment, Which consists of periodically recording
readings from all of the temperature sensors to give a temperature proﬁle for the PEC
during each orbit and monitoring the temperature and sun angle data and determining if
the measurement conditions have been reached. A ﬂowchart illustrating the motherboard

There are three criteria that have to be met in order to take an I-V curve. These criteria
have been named Time-tO-take-data, Sun Angle and Temperature. Below is a brief
description of how the decision for each of these eriterions is made.
Time-to-take-data: The goal is to take I-V curves once an orbit, and to provide a failsafe
means for acquiring data in ease of temperature or sun angle failure. I-V curves can be
taken only after 60 minutes has elapsed since the last I-V curves and I-V curves Will be
taken if 150 minutes has elapsed since the last I-V curves. There are 110 command
parameters associated With this decision.
Sun Angle: The sun angle is deﬁned as the angle formed by the sun and the plane of the
NASA/CP—2007-214494 1 12

"19","MISSE-S solar cells. It is calculated from the two orthogonal sun sensors located in the
same plane as the MISSE 5 solar cells. Valid sun sensor data is indicated by the output
signals of the four shorted solar cells on MISSE-S (daughter board 6, bytes 7 & 8;
daughter board 7, bytes 7&8; daughter board 7 bytes 9 &10; daughter board 8, bytes
7&8) exceeding a threshold value of 157. If any two of the four Ise cells are above this
value, the sun sensor data is valid.
There are two ways the Sun Angle criterion can be met. Firstly, the sun angle is
calculated to be equal to or less than SunThreshold, a one byte value corresponding t0 00
to 640 in 0.250 increments. In this case, UseRelSun equals 0. Secondly, the sun angle is
calculated to be equal to or less than the lowest sun angle value in the rotating buffer plus
an offset of SunThreshold Which varies from —320 to +320 in 0.25 0 increments. In this
case UseRelSun equals 1. There is also a need to recover from a known sun sensor
failure. UseSun is a 2-bit value that decodes as shown in table 4.
_
Table 4: UseSun value deﬁnitions
Temperature: Here we pick a temperature to define When to take I-V curves. To make
this decision we must ﬁrst pick a temperature sensor. This choice of sensor is given in
the command parameter T empID Which is deﬁned in table 5.

NASA/CP—2007-214494 1 13

"
"20","There are two ways to use the chosen sensor for the decision. Firstly, the temperature
criterion is met When the sensor temperature is equal to or greater than the
T empT hreshold value. T empT hreshold is a one byte value corresponding to 173.15 K to
428.15 K, in one degree increments. In this case, the UseRelTemp bit equals 0.
Secondly, the temperature criterion is met When the temperature is equal to or greater
than the highest value of the sensor from the stored values in the rotating temperature
buffer plus an offset value of T empT hreshold. In this case, T empT hreshold is a one byte
value corresponding to an offset of —225 to +40 in one degree increments.
In this case, the UseRelTemp bit equals 1.
The variable DaughterEnabZe (9 bits) is used to power-on or power-off a given daughter
board during the experiment. This is used in case a dangerous fault develops When
powering on a particular daughter board. By setting this parameter low, a daughter board
Will never be turned on until a new command is sent to undo this action. It is a 9-bit
parameter. The lsb corresponds to daughter board 1, if the bit is set high then the
daughter board Will be enabled during all measurement cycles. If the bit is set low, then
it will remain off forever. The msb corresponds to daughter board 9. For example value
of 111111111 means all boards are enabled during measurements, the value 000000000
means all boards are off, the value 0001100111 means only daughter Boards; 1,2,3, 6 and
7 are enabled.
The variable IscSetpoint (3 6-bytes) contains the starting Iso values or to use the auto Iso
function. If all bits are low then auto Iso should be initiated (default mode). Each byte
corresponds to the most significant 8-bits of a 12-bit starting Iso value. The least
significant 4-bits should be set to 0000. The mapping of the 36-bytes is shown in figure
1 8.

Discussion
In order to participate in a variety of small-budget space missions, engineers and scientist
must learn to intelligently incorporate COTS parts into their designs. For MISSES a
combination of rad-hard, rad-tolerant and latoh-up immune parts were conﬁgured using
TMR, current monitoring, watchdog-timer resets, data backup, error detection and

NASA/CP—2007-2 14494 1 l4

"
"21","recovery techniques in order to achieve the required level of radiation mitigation. The
radiation performance of the COTS parts used in MISSES were guaranteed by design,
process, testing or various combinations of the aforementioned. Software methods such
as redundant data storage, RAM/ROM CRC checking, data packetization with CRC
checking, timer watchdogs and repetitive measurements also serve as excellent tools to
handle SEU and total dose effects on hardware. Lastly, there is no substitute for
ingenuity as evidenced by the novel circuitry used to interrogate the solar cells. The
traditional approaches would have either Violated our weight budget with a multitude of
load resistors or potentially damaged the cells by driving currents above Iso through the
cell junctions. With all of the constraints of a space grade payload added to the constraint
of a “coach” budget, we succeeded in producing an instrument that rivals laboratory
grade equipment. Illustrating this point, a comparison of data measured by one of the
daughter boards on a 3] InGaP/GaAs/Ge solar cell under illumination by the X-25 solar
simulator in the NRL Solar Cell Characterization Laboratory with data measured by
laboratory equipment under illumination by the same simulator is shown in ﬁgure 19.2
This graph shows accurate reproduction of the IV curves obtained from calibrated
laboratory equipment and the ﬂight hardware. Furthermore, the deviation between data
sets is at worst the same and in many regions of the IV curve smaller when using the
GRC MISSES board when compared to the laboratory equipment.

"22","Conclusion

The combination of process tracking COTS parts for radiation hard/tolerant pedigree and

designing hardware and software With radiation mitigation in mind produced a reliable,

space-worthy experiment package that also met our budget restrictions. Furthermore,
most solar cell experiments employ a bank of switched load resistors or a programmable,
bipolar current source for making the IV measurements. The MISSES MOSFET
conﬁguration is much lighter and smaller than the aforementioned and, as compared to
the current source configuration, also safer for the cells, and thus signifies a substantial
improvement in the state of the art. Lastly, data accuracy was not sacrificed by meeting
our radiation and budget constraints. The MISSES equipment performed as well or better
that the laboratory equipment used to verify its operation.
