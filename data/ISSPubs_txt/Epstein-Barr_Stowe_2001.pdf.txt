"1","Elevated Stress Hormone Levels Relate to Epstein-Barr Virus Reactivation
in Astronauts
RAYMOND P. STOWE, PHD, DUANE L. PIERSON, PHD, AND ALAN D. T. BARRETT, PHD
Objective: The objective of this study was to determine the effects of stress and spaceﬂight on levels of neuroen-
docrine hormones and Epstein—Barr Virus (EBV)—speoific antibodies in astronauts. Methods: Antiviral antibody
titers and stress hormones were measured in plasma samples collected from 28 astronauts at their annual medical
exam (baseline), 10 days before launch (L—10), landing day (R+0), and 3 days after landing (R+ 3). Urinary stress
hormones were also measured at L— 10 and R+0. Results: Significant increases (p < .01) in EBV virus capsid antigen
antibodies were found at all three time points (L—10, R+0, and R+ 3) as compared with baseline samples. Anti-EBV
nuclear antigen antibodies were significantly decreased at L—10 (p < .05) and continued to decrease after
spaceﬂight (R+0 and R+3, p < .01). No changes were found in antibodies to the nonlatent measles Virus. The 11
astronauts who showed evidence of EBV reactivation had significant increases in urinary epinephrine and norepi-
nephrine as compared with astronauts without EBV reactivation. Conclusion: These findings indicate that physical
and psychological stresses associated with spaceﬂight resulted in decreased Virus—speoifio T—oell immunity and
reactivation of EBV. Key words: Epstein—Barr virus, stress, spaceﬂight, microgravity, viral immunity.
