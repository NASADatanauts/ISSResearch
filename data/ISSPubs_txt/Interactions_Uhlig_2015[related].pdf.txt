The astronauts on board the International Space Station (188) are only the most Visible part of a much larger team engaged around
the clock in the performance of science and technical activities in space. The bulk of such team is scattered around the globe in ﬁve
major Mission Control Centers (MCCs), as well as in a number of smaller payload operations centres. Communication between
the crew in space and the ﬂight controllers at those locations is an essential element and one of the key drivers to eﬂicient space
operations. Such communication can be carried out in different forms, depending on available technical assets and the selected
operational approach for the activity at hand. This paper focuses on operational voice communication and provides a quantitative
overview of the balance achieved in the Columbus program between collaborative space/ground operations and autonomous on-
board activity execution. An interpretation of the current situation is provided, together with a description of potential future
approaches for deep space exploration missions.

This paper analysed approximately 1/ 2 a year of Columbus
related voice communication and Classiﬁed it into different
types. 36% of the investigated procedures (ODF) required
verbal communication; almost all of this can however be
avoided by improved procedure standards, improved on-
board systems, or decoupling of crew and ground operations.

However, still a large amount of activities requires real-
time communications, which in some cases is not just
convenient but rather crucial. This is especially true for
all communications linked to off—nominal and unplanned
situations.

Future missions with signiﬁcant communication delays (a
trip to Mars could experience delays up to the range of 1/2
an hour) will require signiﬁcant adaptations of the operations
concept, and Mission Control Centres will rather assume the
role of Mission Support Centres due to the impossibility of
truly real-time communication.

Innovative communications concepts as well as different
team dynamics [9] will need to be devised, and one possible
example is shown in Figure 7.

This approach foresees sending not just a single voice
message to the remote spacecraft, but rather a multitude of
them embedded into a logical structure, which is analysed by
the on-board computer and presented to the crew based on
their responses. Only when the predeﬁned communication is
terminated are the results sent back to the ground, and they
can be reviewed by the Flight Control Teams.
