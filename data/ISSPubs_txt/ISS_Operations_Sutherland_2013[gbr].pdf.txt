Object. It has been over a decade since the introduction of the da Vinci Surgical System into surgery. Since then,
technology has been advancing at an exponential rate, and newer surgical robots are becoming increasingly sophisti—
cated, which could greatly impact the performance of surgery. NeuroArm is one such robotic system.

Methods. Clinical integration of neuroArm, an MR—compatible image—guided robot, into surgical procedure has
been developed over a prospective series of 35 cases with varying pathology.

Results. Only 1 adverse event was encountered in the ﬁrst 35 neuroArm cases, with no patient injury. The
adverse event was uncontrolled motion of the left neuroArm manipulator, which was corrected through a rigorous
safety reView procedure. Surgeons used a graded approach to introducing neuroArm into surgery, with routine dissec—
tion of the tumor—brain interface occurring over the last 15 cases. The use of neuroArm for routine dissection shows
that robotic technology can be successfully integrated into microsurgery. Karnofsky performance status scores were
signiﬁcantly improved postoperatively and at 12—week follow—up.

Conclusions. Surgical robots have the potential to improve surgical precision and accuracy through motion
scaling and tremor ﬁlters, although human surgeons currently possess superior speed and dexterity. Additionally,
neuroArm’s workstation has positive implications for technology management and surgical education. NeuroArm is
a step toward a future in which a variety of machines are merged with medicine.
