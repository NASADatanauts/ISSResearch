ABSTRACT: The Constrained Vapor Bubble (CVB) is a wickless, grooved heat pipe and is the ﬁrst, full—scale ﬂuids experiment
ﬂown on the US. module of the International Space Station. The CVB promises to provide new insight into the operation of a heat
i e in s ace. It is a relativel sim le device constructed from a s ectro hotometer cuvette and uses entane as the workin ﬂuid.
P P P Y P P P P g
The pentane ﬂows within the corners of the cuvette due to a curvature gradient in the liquid menisci associated with the cuvette
corners. The curvature of the liquid interface can be determined by Viewing the meniscus through the transparent quartz walls.
Extremely accurate temperature and pressure measurements were obtained in addition to the images. In the article, the results from
the ﬁrst two CVB modules—a dry calibration module and a wet heat pipe module—are presented. We show that the axial
temperature proﬁles are signiﬁcantly different in space. The heat pipes were seen to operate at a higher pressure and higher
temperature in space primarily because radiation was the only heat loss mechanism. A ﬁn model was developed to model the data,
and Churchill’s correlations for natural convection were used to determine the external heat transfer coefﬁcient. Inside evaporation
and condensation heat transfer coefﬁcients were regressed from the temperature data. We show that the heat transfer coefﬁcient in
microgravity was higher.
