ABSTRACT
Recently launched and installed inside the Window Observational Research Facility (WORF) in the International
Space Station (ISS), the International Space Station Agricultural Camera (ISSAC) sensor is an area-scan multi-
spectral optical imaging system built by students and faculty at the University of North Dakota (UND). Radiometric
calibration was conducted before launch and performance validation was evaluated with radiance extracted from
Landsat5 TM image that was overpassed nearly at the same time as ISSAC overpass. Ground truth measurement
with Analytical Spectral Devices (ASD, ASD Inc., Boulder CO) was also carried out over fairly homogenous
regions of interest such as bare soil, gravel parking lot, crop and short grass pastures. Using the 6S radiative transfer
model, radiances measured at the top-of—the atmosphere were converted into surface reﬂectance. Atmospheric
corrected surface reﬂectance from ISSAC images was compared with the spectrum of ground ASD measurement.
The results for both radiance and surface reﬂectance show fairly good agreements. This indicates that ISSAC would
be a prospective candidate that would be able to ﬁll the temporal gaps of Landsat 16-day revisit cycle. Higher rate of
temporal opportunities from ISSAC sensor will result in signiﬁcant improvement on decision making for users
especially in time sensitive disaster management, farming practices or environmental issues occurred in short time

frame.
Keywords: International Space Station, radiance, reﬂectance, radiometric validation.

INTRODUCTION
ISSAC sensor is a multispectral instrument designed to acquire three spectral bands in green, red, and Near-Inﬁared
(NIR) with higher temporal frequency. The imaging system has been developed by students and faculty in the
University of North Dakota at low cost budget. The system is installed inside the Window Observational Research
Facility (WORF) in the International Space Station (ISS), optical window on the 188. In order to keep costs low,
ISSAC used commercial-off—the-shelf (COTS) products. Electro-optical components of ISSAC include an f/4 Sigma
150 mm lens (APO EX-DG Macro HSM), a beam splitter, and three two digital area scan cameras (Basler AG,
Germany) . ISSAC is capable of pointing in a cross-track direction of up to i300, enabling multiple revisits of a
target during a short time period. The 188 orbits at 51.6 degree inclination, with an altitude that varies between 350
and 420 km. Orbital speed varies accordingly; a nominal velocity of 7,220 m/s at 400 km altitude. The imaging
system features three 1392 X 1040 CCD arrays of spectral bands of green, red, and near infrared (NIR) with 12-bit
quantization. Ground foot print is about 21.5 km X 16 km with ground sample distance of 20 In at a nominal ISS
altitude of 350km above sea level. With capability of i 30 degrees off—nadir pointing angle ISSAC provides frequent
images on applications of disaster response and agricultural practices with possibilities of multiple times a day to a
week to users. Due to its spectral similarity, we examined radiometric performance of the ISSAC sensor and
compared results of several targets extracted from Landsat Thematic Mapper(TM). Pre-launch sensor
characterization was conducted at NASA AMES research center, Moffett ﬁeld, CA including determination of
spectral bandpasses of three spectral bands; green, red, and NIR, measurement of radiometric responsivity with 30-
inch NIST calibrated integrating sphere, and characterization of ﬂat ﬁeld through entire ﬁeld of View. Following
laboratory characterization, ﬁeld measurements of few ground targets were conducted to validate radiometric
performance of the ISSAC sensor. This paper reports on experimental and validation work of the radiometric
calibration and the ﬁrst results from ground truth validation of in-ﬁight condition of the sensor.

"2","SPECTRAL & RADIOMETRIC CALIBRATION
Sensor Pre-launch Radiometric Calibration

In order for data to be comparable, remote sensing sensor must be calibrated. In addition, calibration of the
sensor must be validated in on-orbit environment after launch to investigate any performance change due to launch
Vibration, in microgravity and in different radiation environment. For pre-ﬁight characterization of the ISSAC
sensor, spectral and radiometric calibration was conducted in collaboration with the Airborne Sensor Calibration
Laboratory (ASCL) at the NASA Ames Research Center located in Moffett ﬁeld, CA. Sensor pre-launch calibration
performed includes (1) spectral bandpass determination (2) radiometric responsivity of output digital counts
corresponding to known input radiance, and (3) CCD array variance and lens fall-off characterization (Olsen et al.,
2011)

Spectral characterization was performed using an Oriel 7345 tunable narrowband monochrometer (ﬁgure 1). The
FWHM for the collimated light is 5 nm. A full spectrum scan was ﬁrst performed to validate the bandpass 0f the
trim ﬁlters. Next, spectral response for each camera was determined every 5 nm. Before and after each measurement,
reference spectra were recorded using a calibrated silicon photodiode to monitor the stability of the light source. The
spectral responses of ISSAC sensor show in Figure l.

Radiometric characterization was performed using a 30 inch diameter l2-bulb integrating sphere. The sphere
contains twelve 45 W lamps operated at a nominal 6V (Steven et al., 2005). The integrating sphere is coated on its
inside surface with barium sulfate and provides spectral range of 350-2500r1m. The lamps are controlled by twelve
short switches assigned to each corresponding lamp. Individual lamp voltage and currents are displayed on the
control switch panel. The sphere has a 10 inch diameter aperture emitting upward direction. The instrument is
calibrated on a periodic basis to a traceable radiometric source to the US. National Institute of Standards and
Technology (NIST) standard of spectral irradiance. The light bulbs were turned on successively and the camera took
images looking into the integrating sphere caVity at each level until saturation. The absolute radiance at each bulb
level was measured at 10 nm spectral interval for calibration purpose on Sep. 15, 2010. The spectra were used to
calculate absolute response by conVOlVing ISSAC spectral bands.

Figure 2 shows NASA AMES 30 inch integrating sphere and absolute radiance of AMES integrating sphere and
output spectral response variation measured by ISSAC sensor. The absolute radiance of the integrating sphere was
calibrated 0n the very next day, September 10, 2010 using a NASA NIST traceable source. Detector responses at
different lamp level were convolved using three ISSAC spectral band passes. DN output was also measured at
corresponding radiance input from the integrating sphere.

TW represents transmittance of the US Laboratory Window, as measured during pre—ﬂight characterization. Pre—
ﬂight optical transmittance of the Window was measured by NASA; transmittance in the green, red and NIR band of
ISSAC is estimated to be 95.53%, 97.48%, and 93.30% respectively (Scott et al., 2003).

In order to investigate scene artifacts and lens falloff effect, uniform target imagery was obtained from a ﬂat—
ﬁeld uniform source, Which uses diffuse glass emission plate With multiple reﬂective internal bafﬂes between the
output plate and an adjustable stable bulb source. The exiting light ﬁeld is Within 1% Lambertian for angles up to 30
degrees. Placement of the ISSAC sensor Within a few centimeters of the output diffuser further improved quality of
the exiting light ﬁeld, as near—ﬁeld de—focus effects averaged any residual source variations from dust or other minor
source defects.

Radiometric Calibration Validation
First, radiance conversion was applied to images of ISSAC and Landsat5 TM scenes acquired near El Paso, TX .
The images were acquired only a few seconds apart, with ISSAC at nadir Viewing angle, resulting in negligible
differences in sun—sensor—target geometry and atmospheric conditions. Four different targets were extracted from
vegetated cover and bare soil. Radiometric calibration was applied to a Landsat5 TM image obtained from USGS
EROS center[1]. Radiometric conversion procedure was same except multiplying the window transmittance
coefﬁcients. Figure 4 shows a scatterplot of radiance comparison between ISSAC and Landsat. A number of pixels
were extracted from the targets and simple average was applied. Due to the difference of spatial resolution between
two sensors, averaged pixel numbers are slightly different. Radiance of red and green bands shows quite good
agreement. NIR band shows slight deviation from 1:1 line. At lower brightness targets, higher radiance was
observed with ISSAC sensor, but observed higher radiance from Landsat image at brighter targets. Possible source
of the deviation observed in NIR band might be due to spectral bandpass differences (Tiellet et al., 2007). Spectral
response in NIR band of ISSAC sensor seems to be shifted toward shorter wavelength compare to NIR band of
Landsat5 TM and somewhat narrower than that of Landsat5 TM.

"5","Atmospheric Correction
Signals from satellite imagery data are degraded by a result of atmospheric attenuation with scattering and
absorption. These atmospheric effects depend on the wavelength of the imaging sensor system and vary spatially
and temporally. The Second Simulation of the Satellite Signal in the Solar Spectrum (68) is a radiative transfer code
developed by Vermote et al., (1997) and simulates the effect on the radiation transferred through the Earth’s
atmosphere in the spectral range 0.25 -4.00 urn. The 68 code simulates the effect of the atmosphere in the signal due
to atmospheric attenuation by scattering by molecules and aerosols and by absorption - mainly by H20, CO2, 02,
O3, CH4, and N20 (Vermote et at, 2006). The input parameters include the Viewing and illumination geometry,
atmospheric model for the gaseous components, aerosol model, Visibility, sensor/band information, and surface
condition. The 68 code computes the TOA radiance or reﬂectance corresponding measured value on the ground.
The input information on atmospheric conditions is the same as in the situation described above, but no BRDF are
considered apart from a Lambertian target assumption. The surface condition in this work is assumed homogeneous
and no bi-directional reﬂectance effect was considered. Two simple cases were compared; one using default
gas/aerosol model and another using column water vapor and ozone contents obtained from MODIS atmospheric
products, level 2. MODIS is a scanning sensor having 36 spectral bands. The MODIS level 2 products, MOD07
provide precipitable water vapor amount and several atmospheric indices including aerosol and ozone contents at
1km spatial resolution on the ground
For ground validation, spectral data of ﬁve ground targets were collected using ASD FieldSpec3 portable
spectroradiometer (ASD Inc, Boulder, CO) nearly at the same time as ISSAC overpass at 18:27:38 on September 7,
2011. Spectra collection was started 30 minutes ahead and last about an hour. Time difference between image
acquision and ground spectra measurement was within i 30 min and atmospheric effects would be negligible. The
spectroradiometer is characterized by 1.4mm sampling interval from 350nm to 2500mm with a spectral resolution of
3 nm. The sampling interval from 1050 - 2500mm is 2mm with the spectral resolution between 10mm and 12 nm. The
resulting spectrum are then resarnpled to 1mm interval using the ASD software. Spectrum samples were collected
with a continuous mode acquiring every 1 sec interval with 25 degree ﬁeld of View at a height of 1 In above ground
which cover ground circular area with a diameter of about 0.45m. Prior to target sample collection, the radiance of a
standard panel coated with barium sulfate, spectralon (Labsphere, Boulder, Inc) was recorded for target spectrum
normalization. Parallel line transects were drawn Visually across entire width of the targets. Three ground targets
samples, gravel parking lot, green turf grass, and drying grass were collected in Wahpeton, ND on September 5,
2011 and two samples at a sugarbeet farm ﬁeld and harvested wheat stubble ﬁeld with with sparse crop residue in
Manvel, ND on September 7, 2011. About 1000 spectrum were collected for each target and the spectrum are
averaged. Two ISSAC images acquired almost at the same time of ground sample collection and atmospheric
correction was performed using 68 in two atmospheric conditions. Figure 5 shows the results of surface reﬂectance
spectral signature and comparison between ground measurement and ISSAC atmospheric correction.

"6","Image Processing and Data Products
Custom software written in Interactive Data Language (IDL) was developed to perform in-house image
processing. The ISSAC project will deliver three types of Level-l data products: Level-lR, Level-lGO and Level
1A, as is illustrated in Figure 6. Raw imagery data consists of acquired data that has been downlinked Via a
packetized telemetry stream and rebuilt (de-packetized) into individual single-band (green, red, near-infrared) 12-bit
images, in a track—down orientation (direction of ﬂight is at the bottom of the image). The Level-O product is rotated
to track—up orientation, and band-band co-registered into a single 3-band stacked .tif format image. The Level-lR
product has radiometric calibration coefﬁcients applied to produce scaled radiance at the sensor. Level-lGO data has
coarsely-determined latitude and longitude information embedded by using parameters of the spacecraft attitude,
ephemeris, and sensor Viewing angle to ﬁrst establish geo-location to within a few kilometers. Level-lA is a product
with atmospheric correction applied to Level 1G0 data to produce surface reﬂectance image. Entire processing steps
are performed with minimal operator’s intervention such as selecting input ﬁles or parameters at initial processing
stage.

CONCLUSIONS
This paper provides calibration and validation of the ISSAC sensor to investigate onboard imaging performance.
Pre-launch sensor calibration was validated with a Landsat image and ground spectroradiometer measurement.
Spectral radiance and reﬂectance from ISSAC image show promising results for future use in ﬁlling gaps of Landsat
repeat cycle. With its wide range of Viewing capacity, ISSAC also seems to be quite helpful in the area that needs
fast turn-around time such as agricultural application, disaster response, or environmental issues.
