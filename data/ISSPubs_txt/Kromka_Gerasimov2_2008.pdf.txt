Abstract—The results of the DVicon and Kromka—l space experiments aimed at studying the state of contam—
inant deposits on control samples exposed for a long time in the zone of emission incomplete combustion prod—
ucts from the orientation engines of the Mir Orbital Station and International Space Station. An analysis Of the
data 011 the intensity of the action of incomplete combustion products 011 the control samples during the space
experiments made it possible to formulate a critical condition of formation of stable dry deposits of tOXic con—
taminants.
