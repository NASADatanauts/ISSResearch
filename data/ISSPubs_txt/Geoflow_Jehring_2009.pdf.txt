Objective of GeoFlow experiment is to study thermally—driven rotating ﬂuids, in order to
investigate the stability, pattern formation, and transition to turbulence of viscous incom-
pressible ﬂuids contained between concentric, co-axially rotating spheres. These physical
mechanisms are important for a large number of astrophysical and geophysical problems
showing ﬂows in spherical geometry driven by rotation and convection: for example, to
explain the mantle convection 0f the Earth, or the ﬂow in a planet’s interior.

The European microgravity experiment GeoFlow, which is executed in the Fluid Science
Laboratory (FSL) of Columbus module on the International Space Station (ISS), is an
experiment investigating pattern formation and stability of thermal convection in rotating
spherical shells under the inﬂuence of an artiﬁcial central symmetric buoyancy ﬁeld and
eliminated gravity.

In this paper we present numerical preliminary studies of this spherical Rayleigh-Bnard
problem under a central dielectrophoretic force in microgravity environment and ﬁrst ex-
perimental results from ISS. Numerical simulations are done for a range of parameter
values for Rayleigh and Taylor number. For the experiment ﬂow Visualization is realised
using the Wollaston-shearing method.

I. Introduction

The microgravity experiment GeOFlOW is an European project, integrated in the Fluid Science Laboratory
(FSL) in Columbus module of International Space Station (188). This experiment targets on the investigation
of stability and pattern formation of thermal convection in a rotating spherical gap With an artiﬁcial central
dielectrophoretic force ﬁeld by applying an alternating high voltage ﬁeld on the inner spherek3 .

Focusing on main acting forces for example in the inner Earth, that is temperature gradients and rotation,
and neglecting magnetic effects in order to stress thermal and rotating aspects of the theoretical formulation
and experimental setup, that corresponds to research on stability and pattern formation of thermal convection
in a rotating spherical gap. If such phenomena are studied experimentally in an Earth lab, gravity acts axial
to a spherical model, and not central, like in the Earth’s core. Such a central force ﬁeld can be setup using
the dielectrophoretic effect by applying a high voltage alternating ﬁeld on the inner sphere Which is than
acting as a spherical capacitor. Resulting artiﬁcial central acceleration equals approximately 10—2m/32,
showing that acceleration due to gravity With g 2 10m / 32 Will always be dominant in an Earth laboratory.
Needed microgravity conditions for research due to thermal experiments especially requiring long—term ones
are available at the International Space Station (188).

bands of Jupiter, the origin of extremely high winds in the tropics and subtropies of Jupiter, Saturn and
Neptune, the persistent differential rotation of the Sun, the complex patterns of convection in the slowly-
rotating mantle of the Earth, and the rapidly rotating ﬂows in the Earth’s outer liquid core. In ﬁgure 1 a
schematic cross section of the Earth is depicted. The convective motions of the liquid iron alloy in the outer
core cause the main geomagnetic ﬁeld.

addition to the experimental tests, a variety of numerical simulations were performed (Futterer et al.22 and

plementary parameter variations as well as analysis of both — stable and time—dependent — ﬂows that was
found to eXist in the parameter range of the GeoFlow experiment.

As optical measurement method Wollaston—shearing interferometry is used to determine the temperature
ﬁelds and corresponding ﬂow pattern.

Here we present numerical preliminary studies which focus on dynamics of non—rotational and rotational
regimes. For the non—rotational case an approach combining numerical simulations with a spectral time—
stepping code and path—following techniques allows the computation of both stable and unstable solution
branches of stationary states. The transition from the stationary t0 the time—dependent regime is described.
Direct numerical simulation of rotational regimes show bifurcations from basic Via periodic and quasi—periodie
state into Chaos. In the low rotation regime drift of time—dependent solutions is prograde while in the higher
rotation regime drift is retrograde with rotation of the sphere.

Finally, we compare numerical predictions of different thermal ﬂow states with ﬁrst experimental data
from 188 experiment. By comparing numerical and experimental results, it should be possible to determine
the dynamics of the observed ﬂow patterns.

The GeoFlow Topical Team consists of science teams from BTU Cottbus (Germany) (PI), Univerity 0f
Potsdam (Germany), University of Leeds (U.K.), University of LeHavre (France), CIRM Marseille (France)
and ESPCI Paris (France). GeoFlow is supported, in technical point of View by EADS Astrium Space Trans—
portation GmbH Friedriehshafen (Germany), MARS Center Naples (Italy) and E—USOC Madrid (Spain).
Financial and organisational support is given by the European Space Agency BSA in Noordwijk (The Nether—
lands) and German Aerospace Center DLR (Germany).

II. The Experiment

Since 2002 the overall preparatory research program comprised work packages for the development of
hardware and software as well as preliminary numerical and experimental investigations. Experiments were
performed in the laboratory at BTU Cottbus using the Science Reference Model (SRM), see ﬁg. 3 (a) and
also in the laboratories of industrial partners who built and veriﬁed the experiment hardware using the
Engineering Model (EM).

Numerical investigations and bifurcation analysis were performed by European research groups from
United Kingdom, France and Germany all being members of the GeoFlow Topical Team. These studies focus
on preparation of the experiment design and on the observable parameter space by ﬂow states simulation
and on linear stability analysis and bifurcation analysis (Futterer;24 Travnikov;25 Gellert26).

One major part of the European Columbus Orbital Facility 0f the ISS is the Fluid Science Laboratory (FSL).
The FSL supports ,u—gravity research in the ﬁeld of ﬂuid physics by means of a speciﬁc triggering and the
observation of phenomena inside of transparent and at the surface of opaque media. It is characterised by a
high level of modularity on all experiment and facility (sub—)system levels.

For the ﬁrst GeOFlOW on—orbit operations investigation of the ﬂow ﬁeld is performed using Wollaston—Shearing
Interferometry (WSI). Schlieren technique and Shadowgraphy are implemented Within FSL as well. Due to
experiment constraints measurement techniques are used in reﬂective mode. The inner sphere of the setup
is prepared to act as a mirror. Figure 5 (a) shows a sketch of the WSI setup at BTU laboratory used for
preparatory experimental works. Because of the acceleration due to gravity the operation mode is parallel
to the axis of the gravitational force 9 on Earth.

WSI method detects refractive index gradients of the working ﬂuid and is therefore sensitive to density
gradients caused by temperature differences in the GeOFlOW experiment. Optical path length variations result
in interference phenomena that are directly photographed by a CCD camera (K). Figure 5 (b) shows WSI
images from ground test sequences taken at different parameter points. Note the complicated interferogram
structures at large Taylor numbers. Rotating axis is located near to the middle bottom of images.

The boundary conditions associated With (7) and (8) are no—slip for velocity ﬁeld U and the values at
the inner and outer shell for temperature T , respectively.

This system of equations and boundary conditions is solved using the numerical code developed by
Hollerbach23 Where U and T are expanded in terms of Chebyshev polynomials in the radial direction 7°,
and Legendre functions in the meridional 6’ and azimuthal direction 90. For the numerical simulation the
parameter Racentml has to be used Without taking into account the geometry of the problem. Thus, Rayleigh
number is deﬁned now as

Racentml = (2 67. 6.. y)/(pu K3) . ATVﬂbs. (10)

After reaching the ﬁnal experiment temperature difference AT and high voltage value Wms only these
two parameters power the convection.

Further input values for the calculations come along With experimental constraints. Working ﬁuid ﬁlling
the spherical gap is a silicone oil of GE Bayer Silicones having a Prandtl number P7“ = 64.64. With inner
radius 7"".- = 27 mm and outer radius r0 = 54 mm the ratio of radii is 77 = 0.5. Experimental runs are to be
performed by applying a constant voltage Wms = 10 kV and varying AT up to 10 K resulting in a Rayleigh
number up to Racentml g 1.4 . 105. Maximum rotation rate up to 2 H 27 corresponds to a Taylor number
value of Tam” = 1.3 ' 107.

Figure 8. Overview of convective states in spherical shells of 77 = 0.5 for Pr = 64.64 depending on
Racentm; and Ta: Besides time—dependency of numerical solution diagram shows linear stability of
most unstable modes m.
A. Thermal Convection
Main parts of parameter variation include setup of temperature gradient between inner and outer sphere
(corresponding to Rayleigh number variation) and rotation of spherical system (corresponding to Taylor
number variation). Figure 8 shows this parameter regime and calculated convective states. Experiment
runs follow this diagram With non—rotating cases by increasing Rayleigh number stepwise and rotating cases,
Where a distinct temperature difference is set up (Ra ﬁxed) and then rotation rates are superimposed by
increasing T a, starting With 10W rotation to intermediate to high rotation regime. In ﬁgure 9 these different
regions are described.
1. Non-Rotatmg Case
Increasing Rayleigh number corresponds to intensifying thermal impulse to the system. Transition from basic
state to steady and then direct to irregular time—dependent convective states are found (Fig. 8). Patterns of
steady state convection depend on initial state. Increasing Rayleigh number stepwise leads to axisymmetric
states (Fig. 9 (a)—(b)), setting thermal impulse immediately from zero reveals more complex symmetries
(Fig. 9 (c)—(d)). With methods of path following analysis the stability of patterns are validated in different
regimes. For experimental work on 188 different patterns Will be observable due to different runs by Changing
the initial states. Refer to Futterer et al.22 and Bergemethh27 for more details on stability discussions. For
irregular ﬂow tetrahedral patterns dominate ﬂow structures.
2. Rotating Case
From low to intermediate to high rotation the experiment traverses stability lines belonging to most of the
unstable modes (Fig. 8). The higher the rotation the higher the azimuthal mode of convective ﬂow (Fig. 10).
Furthermore a Change of drift velocity occurs that was already predicted by stability analysis of Travnikov.28
Direct numerical simulation results show prograde drift for 10W rotation regime and retrograde drift for
intermediate rotation regime. For low rotation patterns are just rotated but not distorted. For intermediate

rotation patterns start to align as tangential cylinders. Centrifugal effects become more important.

Calculations for high rotation are still under progress. Additional time—series analysis for complex time
dependent behaviour is necessary as well. Final aim is to track the transition from basic Via steady to
periodic and Chaotic states for ﬁxed T a and increasing Ra as marked in diagram 8.

IV. Data Analysis

Figure 11 shows the way of data processing, evaluation and interpretation. On the left side forward
modelling With simulation of 3D temperature ﬁeld Which is used for construction of numerical interferograms
is demonstrated. This allows comparison to the experimental interferograms. The small Circle left bottom
gives the actual observation area accessible in the experiment.

On the right side inverse modelling With calculation of the integrated temperature ﬁeld is shown Which
is based on experimental data. An example to demonstrate inverse modelling and to illustrate forward
modelling is given next. This allows for comparison With numerically calculated temperature ﬁelds. The
observed ﬂow patterns can be analysed in detail by using this data ﬂow in a useful manner and allows the
Characterization of the ﬂow pattern. Also, numerical simulations can be veriﬁed With experimental data.

In ﬁgure 12 (a) a work ﬂow for the evaluation of numerical data is shown namely the forward modelling.
The setup is for a heated inner sphere and cooled outer sphere here. The corresponding integrated temper—
ature ﬁeld is shown. The third picture Visualises the variation of the optical path and on upper right side
the simulated interferogram caused by this temperature ﬁeld is illustrated. The numerical interferogram is
needed for the evaluation of experimental data. Figure 12 (b) shows the measured interferogram With a
temperature difference of AT : 4 K , S2 = 0 H z and Wms = 0 kV 0n the top left. In the image down left
there are the relevant extracted fringes for the consecutive ﬂow analysis. A phase shift from the extracted
fringe pattern is calculated for the ﬂow analysis and afterwards integrated to the temperature ﬁeld.30 The
image on the right shows the phase function of the fringes and on the top right is the temperature ﬁeld of
this phase function demonstrated.

V. First Results from Orbit Experiments

First WSI results from COLUMBUS show a very good optical quality. Expected temperature gradients
could be achieved as well as central force ﬁeld strength and rotation rates, i.e. Rayleigh and Taylor numbers.
With end of 2008 10 scientiﬁc runs out of 36 Will be completed. Some examples are presented in ﬁg. 13 and
ﬁg. 14 Without quantitative interpretation that is now under work.

In the upper half of the images a black line shows the position of north pole and rotation aXis approxi—
mately. Figures give 6 images for every 60, i.e. one revolution of the sphere.

For a lOW—rotation case at low Ra number, ﬁg. 13 (a) an axisymmetric ﬂow can be observed. Increasing
Ra number, i.e. temperature difference, see ﬁg. 13 (b), a more complicated ﬂow pattern appears. A special
symmetry can not recognised just from the interferograrns, however, aXial symmetry seems to be broken
deﬁnitely.

Increasing Ta number While keeping constant Ra number, gives rise to an even more complex ﬂow pattern,
With increased inﬂuence of rotation rather than convection due to temperature gradient. However, these ﬁrst
images still have to be analysed in more detail and are intended only as demonstration of feasibility and
quality of the ﬁrst images from GeoFlOW.

For every rotation the triggering gives 6 images With a small ﬁeld of View near to north pole, Which have

"14","VI. Outlook
For further experimental data analysis the Challenge is to implement image processing procedure for
complex ﬂow structures, concerning the the formation and position of the fringes. Additionally, the design
of pattern recognition is necessary for an effective comparison and sorting of many images and other exper—
imental data under speciﬁc criteria.
While the ﬁrst GeoFlow campaign is running now until J uly 2009, a re—ﬂight campaign is under discussion
already (GeoFlow II). For this re—ﬂight a ﬂuid With strongly temperature—dependent Viscosity Will be used
to form a model for Earth mantle convection. The methods of scientiﬁc analysis Will be comparable to that
for GeoFlow I, but the convective behaviour is expected to be quite different compared to GeoFlow 1.
