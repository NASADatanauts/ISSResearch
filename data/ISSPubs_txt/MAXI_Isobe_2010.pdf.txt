Abstract
Strong X—ray ﬂares from the blazer Mrk 421 were detected in 2010 J anuary and
1

"2","February through the 7 month monitoring with the MAXI GSC. The maximum 2
— 10 keV ﬂux in the J anuary and February ﬂares was measured as 120 :l: 10 rnCrab
and 164 :l: 17 rnCrab respectively; the latter is the highest among those reported from
the Object. A comparison of the MAXI and Swift BAT data suggests a convex X—ray
spectrum with an approximated photon index of T Z 2. This spectrum is consistent
with a picture that MAXI is Observing near the synchrotron peak frequency. The
source exhibited a spectral variation during these ﬂares, slightly different from these
in the previous Observations, in which the positive correlation between the ﬂux and
hardness was widely reported. By equating the halving decay timescale in the J anuary
ﬂare, td N 2.5 X 104 s, to the synchrotron cooling time, the magnetic ﬁeld was evaluated
as B N 4.5 X 10—2 G (6/10)_1/3. Assuming that the light crossing time Of the emission
region is shorter than the doubling rise time, tr f, 2 X 104 s, the region size was roughly
estimated as R < 6 X 1015 cm (6/ 10). These are consistent with the values previously
reported. For the February ﬂare, the rise time, tr < 1.3 X 105 s, gives a loose upper limit
on the size as R < 4 x 1016 cm (6/10), although the longer decay time td N 1.4 X 105
s, indicates B N 1.5 X 10—2 G (6/10)_1/3, which is weaker than the previous results.
This could be reconciled by invoking a scenario that this ﬂare is a superposition of
unresolved events with a shorter tirnescale.

1. Introduction

Blazars, including BL Lacerate (BL Lac) Objects, are a class of active galactic nuclei
(AGN), from which a relativistic jet is emanating close to our line of sight. In addition to their
ncn—therrnal radiation ranging from the radio to garnrna—ray frequencies and strong polarization
at radio and Optical frequencies, one Of the most outstanding characteristics of blazars is their
rapid and high—arnplitude intensity variations 0r ﬂares, which provide clues to the ﬂow dynamics,
as well as to particle acceleration and cooling processes Operating in the jet. Since the Ginga
(e.g., Sernbay et a1. 1993; Tashirc et a1. 1995) and ASCA era (e.g., Takahashi et a1. 2000;
Tanihata et a1. 2001), X—ray Observations have been one Of the most useful tools to study the
variability of blazars. In addition, remarkable progress was successively accomplished by X—ray
Observations with RXTE and Swift Observations (e.g., Katacka et a1. 2001; Trarnacere et a1.
2009)

Located at the redshift of z : 0.031, Mrk 421 is a high energy peaked BL Lac Object
(HBLs; Padovani & Gicrnrni 1995). The Object is one Of the brightest extragalactic source at
the very high energy (VHE) garnrna—rays above N 100 GeV (Punch et a1. 1992). A number of

2

(SED) of the source and its variation are basically well understood within the framework of a
simple one—zone synohrotron—self—Cornpton (SSC) model (Band & Grindlay 1985). For Mrk 421,
the X—ray and VHE garnrna—ray bands correspond to, or are located slightly above the peak
frequencies of the synchrotron and inverse Compton (1C) spectral components, respectively.
As a result, Mrk 421 is one of the most extensively studied blazars in the X—ray band (e.g.,
Takahashi et al. 2000; Tanihata et al. 2004), and X—ray ﬂares were frequently reported (e.g.,
Trarnaoere et al. 2009; Donnarurnrna et al. 2009).

As the ﬁrst astronornioal mission on the Exposed Facility of the J apanese Experiment
Module “Kibo”, attached to the International Space Station (188), Monitor of All—sky X—ray
lrnage (MAXI; Matsuoka et al. 2009) started its operation in 2009 August. Thanks to its
unprecedentedly high sensitivity as an all—sky X—ray monitor, and to its capability of real—
time data transfer, MAXI is able not only to make a continuous monitor of X—ray sources
including AGN, but also to alert quickly various transient X—ray phenornena, like ﬂares of
blazars. Actually, in the 7 month MAXI observation, we have successfully made quick alerts of
two strong X—ray ﬂares frorn Mrk 421 (lsobe et al. 2010a; lsobe et al. 2010b); in one of these
ﬂares the object exhibited the highest X—ray ﬂux among those ever recorded. In the present
paper, we report the X—ray features of Mrk 421 in these ﬂares, and discuss their implication.
2. Observation and Results

Among the two X—ray instrurnent onboard MAXI, the Gas Slit Camera (GSC) and the
Solid—state Slit Camera (Tsunerni et al. 2010), we analyze only the GSC data in the present
paper, because of its higher sensitivity and sky coverage (N 97% per day). The GSC utilizes
12 position—sensitive large—area proportional counters sensitive to X—ray photons in 2 — 20 keV,
although 4 out of them were switched off, on 2009 September 22, due to unexpected discharge
events.

The MAXI GSC signals from Mrk 421 were integrated orbit by orbit within a 30 X 30
square aligned to the scan direction centered on the source, while the background level was
evaluated from two squares with oﬂsets of $30 toward the scan direction in the sky, of which
the size is same as that of the source region. We normalized the baokground—subtraoted signal
counts by a tirne—integrated effective area of the oollirnator plus slits above the proportional
counters. In the following, the data from all the activated counters are summed up.

As assistance for the interpretation of the MAXI GSC data, we utilized the hard X—
ray data taken with the Burst Alert Telescope (BAT; Barthelrny et al. 2005) onboard Swift.
The Swift BAT is composed of the coded aperture mask and large area (5200 orn2) CdZnTe
detectors. Thanks to its wide ﬁeld of View (N 1.4 str), the typical sky coverage of the instrument
exceeds N 70 % (Krirnrn 2009) in one day observation. The daily Swift BAT lightourves of Mrk

3

"4","421 in the 15 — 50 keV range are available from the Swift BAT transient monitor results 1,
provided by the Swift BAT team.

Figure 1 (a) and (b) show the normalized signal count rates from Mrk 421 derived with
the MAXI GSC in 2 — 4 keV and 4 — 10 keV, F2_4 arid F4_10 respectively, from 2009 August 22
(MJD : 55065) to 2010 March 20 (MJD : 55275). On the plot, 10 % 0f the count rate from
the Crab Nebula (100 mCrab, F2_4 : 0.13 counts cm_2 s‘1 and F4_10 : 0.125 counts ern—2 s_l;
Nakahira et a1. 2010) is indicated by the dotted lines. We notice some relatively long data gaps,
such as on 2009 September 3 — 7 (MJD : 55077 — 55081), November 12 — 16 (MJD : 55147 —
55151), and 2010 January 19 — 26 (MJD : 55215 — 55222). During these periods, Mrk 421 was
located in the direction toward the ISS orbital pole unobservable with the MAXI GSC. The
Swift BAT lighteurve in the 15 — 50 keV range F15_50 is compared in ﬁgure 1 (C).

The lighteurve reveals that Mrk 421 is highly variable in all the energy ranges. The
fractional root mean square variability parameter (e.g., RodrigueZ—Paseual et a1. 1997) in F2_4,
F4_10 arid F15_50 were evaluated as 0.52, 0.71 and 0.70, respectively, from the daily averaged
lighteurves. The GSC has detected at least four ﬂares with an X—ray ﬂux of Z 100 mCrab, on
2009 November 1 (MJD : 55136), 2009 November 11 (MJD : 55146), 2010 January 1 (MJD :
55197; Isobe et al. 2010a), and February 16 (MJD : 55243; Isobe et al. 2010b). Unfortunately,
the Observational conditions for the ﬁrst and second ﬂares were found to be relatively bad,
although the second ﬂare appears to be concurrent with the hard X—ray one, detected with
the Swift BAT on 2009 November 10 (MJD : 55145; Krimm et a1. 2009). Therefore, we
focus on the GSC data associated the third and forth ﬂares which are indicated by two arrows,
denoted as Epoch A and Epoch B respectively in ﬁgure 1 (b). During Epoch A, no signiﬁcant
increase in F15_50 was apparently found, while the Object brightened in all the energy ranges
during Epoch B. The ﬂare 0f Epoch A (MJD : 55197) was not covered with the Swift BAT,
due to sparse sampling toward Mrk 421 during this period. In addition, the hardness variation
between Epoch A and Epoch B (before the ﬁrst peak) was found to be statistically insigniﬁcant,
as we show below.

Figure 2 shows the 2 — 10 keV GSC lighteurve, F2_4 + F4_10, during Epochs A and 13,
together with hardness ratios, deﬁned as HR1 : F4_10/F2_4 arid HR2 : F15_50/F2_4. The
lighteurve in Epoch A peaks at MJD : 55197.4, with a 2 — 10 keV ﬂux of 120 :l: 10 mCrab,
averaged over 6 hours around the peak. Here and hereafter, the error represents the 10 statis—
tieal one. The doubling time scales in the rise and decay phases of this ﬂare were estimated as
tr f, 2 x 104 s and td N 2.5 X 104 s, respectively. During Epoch B, the source activity continued
for about one month, and we found several ﬂares in the lighteurve. The peak 2 — 10 keV ﬂux
of the ﬁrst ﬂare in Epoch B was measured at MJD : 55243.6 as 164:|: 17 mCrab 0n 6 hour
average. The decay time Of this ﬂare is derived as td N 1.4 X 105 s, a factor of 5 — 6 longer than
that Of the Epoch A ﬂare. Due to the data gap with Z 1 day just before the peak seen in ﬁgure

"
"5","2, we put only a loose upper limit on the rise time as tr < 1.3 X 105 s. The lighteurve exhibited
the second peak at MJD : 55249.6 with a 2 — 10 keV ﬂux of 108 i 7 mCrab.

Utilising the daily averaged hardness ratio, we investigated quantitatively the spectral
variation of Mrk 421 during Epeehs A and B, as summarised in table 1. The hardness of the
source was found to stay unchanged during the Epoch A within the statistical uncertainties
(X2/d0f : 7.3/18 and 14.9/ 15 for H R1 and H R2, respectively). The average and standard
deviation of H R1 were derived as H—R1 : 0.74 and 01 : 0.10, respectively, while those of H R2
were calculated as H—R2 : 5.3 X 10‘2, and 02 : 2.3 X 10‘2. Before the decay of the ﬁrst ﬂare in
Epoch B (MJD : 55232 — 55245; corresponding to the arrow denoted as ”Before” in ﬁgure 2),
the Object exhibited a hardness similar to that in Epoch A. No statistically signiﬁcant spectral
variation was Observed during this phase (X2/d0f : 6.6/11 arid 7.4/9 for H R1 and H R2).
After the decay of the Epoch B ﬁrst ﬂare (MJD : 55246 — 55275; indicated by the arrow
with ”After” in ﬁgure 2), the spectrum of the source seems to harden into H—R1 : 0.90 and
H—R2 : 10.0 X 10‘2, with the standard deviation of 01 : 0.15 and 02 : 2.7 X 10‘2, respectively.
In addition, the source hardness is found to be variable (X2/d0f : 42.1 / 27 and 73.8 / 27 for H R1
and H R2) during this period. Toward the end of Epoch B (MJD E, 55264), the source appears
to recover a hardness similar to those before the ﬁrst peak (and hence these in Epoch A). In
order to Visualize these spectral variation associated with the ﬂares, H R1 and H R2 are plotted
against the source X—ray intensity, F2_4 + F4_10, in ﬁgures 3.

Figure 4 shoes the color—Coler plot between H R1 and H R2 with a time resolution of 3
days. From this ﬁgure, we roughly evaluated the shape of the X—ray spectrum of Mrk 421. If
a simple power—law (PL) model was assumed, the Observed values of H R1 correspond to a 2
— 10 keV photon index of F : 2 — 2.5, as shown by the vertical dashed lines in ﬁgure 4. The
systematic uncertainty in the photon index due to the current GSC response is estimated as
AF : 0.1 (Nakahira et a1. 2010). The ﬁgure also indicates a spectral softening from the MAXI
GSC t0 the Swift BAT energy ranges.

3. Discussion

As shown in ﬁgures 1 and 2, at least the two active phases of Mrk 421 in 2010 J anuary
(Epoch A) and February (Epoch B) were extensively monitored with the MAXI GSC. The
maximum 2 — 10 keV ﬂux of the ﬂare in Epoch A was derived as 120:|: 10 mCrab at MJD
: 55197.4. During Epoch B, the MAXI GSC revealed a signiﬁcant leng—term activity of the
source for nearly a month with a 2 — 10 keV ﬂux of Z 50 mCrab exhibiting multiple ﬂares.
This demonstrates a great advantage of the MAXI GSC for monitoring leng—term variations of
blazars. Especially, the ﬁrst ﬂare 0f Epoch B, of which the peak ﬂuX was measured as 164 :l: 17
mCrab (MJD : 55243.6), is probably associated with a strong and variable activity in the
VHE gamma—rays with the maximum VHE ﬂuX exceeding the 10 Crab level, detected on 2010
February 17 (MJD : 55244) by the VERITAS Observatory (Rene et a1. 2010).

"
"6","Since it was identiﬁed as the ﬁrst extragalaetie VHE y—ray source in 1990s (Punch et a1.
1992), Mrk 421 has been one Of the most extensively studied bIazars. As a result, a number
of X—ray Observations of the Object were conducted with various X—ray Observatories, including
Ginga (Makine et a1. 1992), ASCA (Takahashi et a1. 1996; Takahashi et a1. 2000; Tanihata
et a1. 2001), RXTE (e.g., Kataeka et a1. 2001), XMM—Newton (e.g., Trarnaeere et a1. 2007),
Suzaku (Ushio et a1. 2009) and so forth. Except for in signiﬁcant X—ray ﬂares, its 2 — 10 keV
X—ray ﬂux was reported to be typically below N 50 rnCrab. Thanks to recent X—ray monitoring
Observations with Swift and the A11 Sky Monitor onboard RXTE, strong X—ray ﬂares were
successively reported from the Object; these include the ﬂare in 2006 June with the 2 — 10
keV ﬂux of N 85 rnCrab (Trarnaeere et a1. 2009), the ﬂare in 2008 June with N 130 rnCrab
(Dennarurnrna et a1. 2009) and the ﬂare in 2009 December with N 100 rnCrab (D’Amrnande et
a1. 2009). It is important to note that the maximum X—ray ﬂux in the ﬁrst ﬂare 0f Epoch B,
measured with the MAXI GSC, is higher than any other previous results. Therefore, we have
concluded that the MAXI GSC discovered the strongest X—ray frern Mrk 421.

The celer—Coler plot in ﬁgure 4 suggests that the MAXI GSC spectrum of Mrk 421 is
roughly approximated by a PL with a photon index of F : 2 — 2.5. A convex curvature in the
MAXI GSC and Swift BAT energy range inferred from a comparison of H R1 to H R2 in ﬁgure
4, together with the previous determination of the synchrotron peak energy in Mrk 421 around
the Observed photon energies of Ep : 0.3 — 5 keV (e.g., Tanihata et a1. 2004; Trarnaeere et a1.
2007; Ushio et a1. 2009), implies a smoothly curved X—ray spectrum of the source.

In the case Of HBLs, where the synchrotron peak frequency is located at the X—ray
band, the timescale of the X—ray ﬂux variation is thought to be controlled mainly by interplay
between the following timescales (Kataoka 2000); the acceleration timescale of high energy
electrons Tam, the radiative cooling tirne 70001, and the light crossing time Of the emission region
Tcrs. We, here, describe all the timescales in the Observer’s frame, after converting those in the
source rest frame, 7’, as 7' : T’/6, in order to relate them directly to the Observed timescales.
For a signiﬁcant ﬂare to take place, a condition of Tm, < 70001 is required. Assuming a ﬂare is
a single event, the rise timescale tr is expected to be determined by the longer of Tm, and Tcrs,
while the longer of 70001 and Tcrs is thought to dominate the decay timescale td. The soft X—ray
lag, discovered with ASCA frern Mrk 421 in the decay phase of an X—ray ﬂare (Takahashi et a1.
1996), was regarded to be produced by the energy dependence of 150001. In contrast, symmetric
X—ray Iighteurves with tr N td, Observed in day—seale ﬂares from several HBLs, were interpreted
to be shaped by Tcrs (Tanihata et a1. 2001).

Because the 2 — 10 keV MAXI GSC spectrum around the maximum of the ﬂares was
found to be consistent with F N 2, we regard that the MAXI GSC Observed near the synchrotron
peak frequencies. Therefore, we adopt the above argument on the ﬂare timescale to evaluate
the physical parameters of Mrk 421 in these ﬂares. In the ﬂare 0f Epoch A and the ﬁrst ﬂare 0f
Epoch B, td was measured to be longer than tr. This indicates that tr and td are dominated by

6

"
"7","the different timescales with each other. As a result, we speculate a condition of 700013 Tcrs 3 Tam
or 70001 3, TM, 3, 701.3 in these ﬂares, corresponding to td N 70001 and tr 3, Tcrs.

The synchrotron radiation usually dominates other cooling process in HBLs, includ—
ing Mrk 421 (e.g., Kataeka 2000). Assuming ar1 isotropieally distributed electrons in a ran—
domly oriented magnetic ﬁeld, the synchrotron cooling time scale is expressed as 70001 N
1.5 X 103B_3/2E1:e¥26_1/2 s (re—evaluated from Takahashi et al. 1996), with B, Ekev, and 6 being
the magnetic ﬁeld in G, the synchrotron photon energy in keV, and the beaming factor of the jet,
respectively. We roughly evaluated a time—averaged magnetic ﬁeld of B N 4.5 X 10_2(6/10)_1/3
G in the ﬂare 0f Epoch A, from the relation of td N 70001. Here, we assume the typical syri—
chrotron photon energy of EkeV N 4 keV, by averaging the X—ray spectrum of F N 2 in the
MAXI GSC energy range (2 — 10 keV). This is barely consistent with the value determined
from the 0ne—zor1e SSC modeling to the Observed SED 0f Mrk 421 in previous Observations
within the systematic uncertainty (B : 0.036 — 0.44 G; Kine et al. 2002). A spectral softening
or soft lag, due to the energy dependence of 70001, was unobservable within the MAXI GSC
signal statistics. On the other hand, we can put an upper limit on the size R of the emission
region, as R 3 0701.36 / (1 + z), where C is the speed of light. The condition of tr 3, 701.3 gives
R f, 6 X 1015(6 / 10) cm. This upper limit appears to be consistent with the values reported in
the previous strong X—ray ﬂares (e.g., Donnarumma et al. 2009).

In the similar manner, we put a loose upper limit from tr 0n the region size of the Epoch
B ﬁrst ﬂare as R f, 4 x 1016(6/10) em. The magnetic ﬁeld, B N 1.5 X 10_2(6/10)_1/3 G, is
found to be weaker by a factor of N 3 than that in the Epoch A ﬂare due to td longer by a
factor of 5 — 6, while the spectral softening (from HR2 : (7.6 i 0.9) X 10—2 at MJD : 55243
to (5.1 :l:0.7) X 10—2 at MJD : 55245), suggested in ﬁgures 2 and 3 during the decay phase
of the Epoch B ﬁrst ﬂare, appears to be related to the cooling process. We cannot deny a
simple explanation for the possible weak magnetic ﬁeld that this ﬂare was produced in a part
Of the jet different from that Of the Epoch A ﬂare with slightly different physical parameters
and/or conditions, from the MAXI data alone. However, we regard that td is not actually
determined by 70001 in the case Of this ﬂare, because the derived magnetic ﬁeld is found to be
out Of range of the typical value of Mrk 421 in the previous studies (e.g., Kine et al. 2002).
Based on Close examination on X—ray lighteurve 0f HBLs Obtained in the long—look ASCA arid
RXTE Observation with a duration of Z 1 week, Tanihata et al. (2001) proposed a possibility
that day—seale ﬂares 0f HBLs are composed of short events with a timescale of N 104 s. A
similar scenario is possible to account for the duration of the ﬁrst ﬂare 0f Epoch B (td N 1.6
day), longer by a factor of 5 — 6 than that Of the Epoch A ﬂare. It is important to note that
in order to validate the physical quantities estimated here, examination of a multi—wavelength
SED 0f Mrk 421, widely covering the synchrotron and 1C components, and its variation are
required, although it is beyond the scope of the present paper.

Within the framework of a simple 0ne—zor1e SSC model, the peak energy and luminosity

7

"
"8","of the synchrotron component is thought to scale as Ep o< By§6 and Lp o< B2y§(2_FP)62+FP NeV,
where yp, Fp(< 2), Ne and V is the maximum Lorentz factor of the radiating electrons, the
synchrotron photon index below Ep (assuming a simple PL spectrum), the normalization of the
electron number density spectrum, and the volume of the emission region, respectively. From
these sealing relation, a Change in B, yp or 6 is expected to be observed as a positive correlation
between Ep and Lp, while only Lp is anticipated to increase when Ne or V (corresponding to the
total electron number) increase. The Clear positive Ep—Lp correlation, widely reported from
Mrk 421 in the previous observations (e.g., Tanihata et a1. 2004; Tran1aoere et a1. 2007), is
thought to suggest the Change in B , yp or 6.

The rise of Ep is thought to be recognised as a rise in H R1 and H R2. The hardness—
intensity relation, shown in ﬁgure 3, suggests a slightly complicated spectral variation, which
appears not necessarily to follow the Ep—Lp positive correlation, especially in Epoch B. We
notice that H R2 become larger, after the end of the ﬁrst ﬂare in Epoch B, as Clearly shown
in ﬁgure 2 and table 1. Although at the second ﬂare of Epoch B the source is fainter by
N 30 % than at the ﬁrst one, its hardness (HR2 : (10.3:l: 1.5) x 10—2 at MJD : 55249) is
higher than that at the ﬁrst ﬂare (HR2 : (7.6 :l: 1.5) x 10—2 at MJD : 55243). In addition,
the hardest X—ray spectrum was realized, when the source ﬂux was about one third of the
maximum at the ﬁrst peak (HR2 : (17.4:|:2.5) x 10—2 at MJD : 55262). In order to interpret
such a spectral behaviour within a simple one—zone SSC framework, ﬁne tuning of the physical
parameters is required (e.g., a combination of the increase in B , yp or 6 and the decrease in
N6 or V). Otherwise, a multiple—zone/Conlponent SSC model (e.g., Ushio et a1. 2009) could be
preferred. For detailed examination, it is necessary to investigate the multi—frequenoy SED and
its variation.

Fig. 1. Daily lightcurve of Mrk 421. The panels (a) and (b) show the normalized count rate in the 2 — 4
keV (F4_10) and 4 — 10 keV (F2_4) ranges, respectively, measured With the MAXI GSC from 2009 August
22 (MJD:55062) to 2010 March 20 (MJD:55275). For MJD : 55197, 55243 and 55249, F4_10 and F2_4
are plotted in a time resolution of 6 hours, in order to resolve the peak. The Swift BAT lightcurve in 15
— 50 keV, F15_50, is plotted in the panel (c). All the errors represent the 10 statistical one. The dotted
lines indicate the count rate of 100 mCrab in the individual energy ranges. The two arrows in the center
panel deﬁne Epochs A and B.

Fig. 2. Lightcurve of Mrk 421 during Epochs A (panel a) and B (panel b). The GSC 2 — 10 keV
count rate F4_10 + F2_4 in a time resolution of 6 hours is shown in the top. A time resolution of 1.5
hour is adopted, When the 6 hour averaged ﬂux is higher than the 100 mCrab level (the dotted line).
The center and bottom display the daily—averaged hardness ratios, deﬁned as H R1 : F4_10/F2_4 and
HR2 : F15_50/F2_4, respectively. For MJD : 55197 in panel (a), HR1 is displayed every 6 hours. The
hardness for the Crab—like spectrum With the photon index of F : 2.08 (Toor 84: Seward 1974) With the
Galactic absorption column density of NH : 3.2 X 21 em_2 (Kalberla et a1. 2005) is expressed by the dotted
lines. The long and short arrows in the center of panel (b) deﬁne the phases before and after the decay of
the Epoch B ﬁrst peak (MJD : 55246), adopted in ﬁgures 3 and 4.
