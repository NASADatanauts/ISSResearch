This paper is concerned with the type II dehydroquinase
Correspondence e'ma“: (DHQase) from Actinobacillus pleuropneumoniae (referred
dominique‘ma93@v“b‘a“bc to here as Ap-DHQase). DHQase catalyses the dehydration
of 3~dehydroquinate (DHQ) to 3~dehydroshikimate (Fig. 1), a
reaction common to two metabolic pathways that are absent in
animals: (i) the biosynthetic shikimate pathway, Which is used
for synthesis of aromatic compounds (present in micro-
organisms and plants), and (ii) the catabolic quinate pathway,
which enabies the use of quinate as a carbon and energy
source (present in fungi and some microorganisms). DHQases
have been found to fat! into two main classes: type I and type
II. Representative structures of DHQases of both types have
recently been solved (Gourley et at, 1999). The two classes of
enzymes operate by entirety different mechanisms; their
sequences are unreiated and they have different folds and
subunit organization. The type I enzyme is a dimer of eight
stranded a/ﬂbarrels, while the type II enzyme has a dodeca-
meric quaternary structure. The existence of two distinct types
of DHQase in micrcorganisms offers a unique opportunity to
seiectively inhibit some pathogenic microorganisms using the
type II enzyme as a drug target (Coggins et at, 2003).
Actinobacillus (formerly Haemophilus) pleuropneumoniae
is an aetioiogicai agent of porcine pleuropneumonia, a major
respiratory disease in pigs (for recent reviews, see Bosse et aL,
2002; Lalonde e: at, 1994; Rycroft & Garside, 2000, and
references therein). The Wide Spread of the disease causes
