19 November 2013 impact of space radiation on structure and function. As natural biomaterials, the impact of the space

5 December 2013 film surfaces were etched by heavy ionizing particles such as atomic oxygen, the major component of the
low-Earth orbit space environment. Unexpectedly, more than 80% of the silk and collagen materials were
chemically crosslinked by space radiation. These findings are critical for designing next-generation

tufts edu) electromagnetic radiation, high energy particles, and extremes of heat and cold”. The fibrous proteins, such
' as collagen, dominate human tissue structure and function“, and the silk fibrous proteins are the most
mechanically robust and intriguing spun materials in nature8‘10. This family of materials is also used in textiles
and as medical devicesll‘”. Thus, there is broad interest in understanding how these materials respond in space as
a prelude to their future utility in space—related applications due to their broad impact on human health, their
environmental and bio—compatibility, and their versatile utility in foods, medicine, and materials.

The primary sequence of collagen involves a GXY amino acid repeat, where G is Glycine, and X and Y can be
any of the amino acids but most often are proline and hydroxyproline”. Collagen forms macromolecular
hierarchical structures, starting from three left-handed helices intertwined to form a right-handed triple helix.
Proline and hydroxyproline stabilize the triple helical structures“. Collagen biomaterials provide essential roles in
tissue regeneration, and are also utilized in drug delivery, biosensors, and biophotonics‘”. Thus, knowledge about
the interactions between the space environment and collagens would be useful for the health and safety of
astronauts, as well as possible collagen-based biomaterials for use in space environments.

Silk ﬁbroin proteins are synthesized by silkworms and formed into fibers with remarkable strength and
toughnesss‘lo. The primary structure of B. mori silk ﬁbroin consists mainly of the repeat sequences of
[GAGAGSLD which form physical crosslinks, the beta sheets, which stabilize silk materialslS‘IS. Silk has been
widely used in the textile industry for centuries, and material options have expanded to ﬁlms, gels, particles,
devices, composites and other formatsll‘13”15‘18 for use as materials for tissue regeneration. These biomaterials
offer tunable mechanical properties and degradability as well as biocompatibility. Understanding the impact of
space radiation on silk materials would provide insight into the potential utility of this tough protein-based
material for space-related materials and biomedical needs, as well as afford a comparison of very stable beta sheet
crystals in silk to the relatively less stable triple helical structure in collagen.

Silica (SiOz) particles were also incorporated into the protein ﬁlms (silk-silica, collagen-silica) as examples of
organic-inorganic composites to compare responses with the neat protein systems. Silica-related composites are
common in many biological systems as well as in artificial composites, and offer potential utility in space-related
material systemsw‘“. Silica is widespread in biological systems to support and protect single-celled organisms,
such as diatoms, as well as in higher plants and animalsl9‘21. In nature, the biosynthesis of biosilica in viva occurs
under mild ambient physiological conditions”, and silica in protein materials can be utilized in osteogenesis
related to bone repair19‘21. Studies on these composite materials can provide information about inorganic-protein
interactions in harsh space environments, which can be used for future material designs and medical applications.

Space radiation includes variable in-transit energies such as electromagnetic waves or high-energy particles
