ABSTRACT
""Crickets in Space"" was a Neurolab experiment by which the balance between genetic programs and the
gravitational environment for the development of a gravity sensitive neuronal system was studied. The
model character of crickets was justiﬁed by their external gravity receptors, identiﬁed position—sensitive
intemeurons (PSI) and gravity-related compensatory head response, and by the speciﬁc relation of this
behavior to neuronal arousal systems activated by locomotion. These advantages allowed to study the
impact of modiﬁed gravity on cellular processes in a complex organism. Eggs, 1st, 4th and 6th stage lar-
vae of Acheta domesticus were used. Post-ﬂight experiments revealed a low susceptibility of the behavior
to micro- and hypergravity while the physiology of the PSI was signiﬁcantly affected. Immunocytological
investigations revealed a stage-dependent sensitivity of thoracic GABAergic motoneurons to 3g-condi-
tions concerning their soma sizes but not their topographical arrangement. The morphology of neuromu-
scular junctions was not affected by 3 g-hypergravity. Peptidergic neurons from cerebral sensorimotor
centers revealed no signiﬁcant modiﬁcations by microgravity (pg). The contrary physiological and beha-
vioral results indicate a facilitation of 1 g-readaptation originating from accessory gravity, proprioceptive
and visual sense organs. Absence of anatomical modiﬁcations point to an effective time window of pg- or
3 g-expo-sure related to the period of neuronal proliferation. The analysis of basic mechanisms of how
animals and man adapt to altered gravitational conditions will proﬁt from a continuation of the project

INTRODUCTION
In space research, vertebrates like ﬁsh, amphibia, rats and mice are preferred experimental models to
study the impact of modiﬁed gravity on the deveIOpment (cf. Bertoz and Giiell, 1998). We chose crickets
to study effects of altered gravitational forces (AGF) on the deve10pment of theirnervous system. These
insects possess an external gravity sense organ. Its stimulation by postural displacements of the animal
induces a compensatory head response (rCHR) which, in lst instars, can be induced by a single sensory
unit (Horn and Féller, 1998). An identiﬁed intemeuron, the position sensitive interneuron (PSI) partici-
pate in the information transfer from this sense organ to motor and integrative centers of the nervous sy—
stem. Its activity is related to the posture of the animals' body (Sakaguchi and Murphey 1983).
In insects, prOprioceptive reafferences caused by leg movements, or arousal with central or peripheral
origin are nececcary for the performance of gravity related behavior. They are responsible for a “physio-

logical gating” of the nervous pathway connecting the gravity receptors with neck muscles (Horn and
Knapp, 1984; Horn and Foller, 1985). Thus, modiﬁcations induced by AGF conditions may be caused by
physiological and morphological changes of neurons linked to the motor system and integrative nervous
structures. These neurons are located in the thoracic ganglia and in the sensorimotor center of the brain.
We studied the effect of AGF on two groups of GABA-immunreactive neurons within the thoracic gang-
lia of the crickets, (1) groups of interneurons located in clusters dorsally, and (2) 6 motoneurons, the
common inhibitors (CI) located ventrally. CIs innervate wing and leg muscles (Hale and Burrows, 1985;
Watson et al., 1985). In addition, we chose neurons within the sensorimotor centers, a site of information
transfer from the sensory to the motor level. Most of these neurons are peptidergic; some of them project
to the terminal ganglion, the ﬁrst relais station of the gravity sensitive neuronal network (Agricola, 1997;
Agricola and Bréiunig, 1995; Johnsen et al. , 2000; Veenstra, 1989).

METHODS

Cricket larvae (Acheta domesticus) were exposed to hyper- and microgravity (hg and pg, respective-
ly) in the BOTEX (Botany Experiment) incubator originally developed by the German Aerospace Center
(DLR) for experiments with plants (cf. German Spacelab mission D-2, STS-55, in 1993). Slight modiﬁ-
cations transformed it in a ﬂight hardware useful for animal studies. BOTEX is equipped with a 1g-
reference centrifuge for lg-simulation in orbit (77 revolutions, providing 1g at radius r = 152 mm). The
nominal operating temperature of BOTEX is 27° C; operating temperatures range between 25 and 29° C
in steps of 1° C; control accuracy is 1° C. The thermal concept is based on Peltier elements, surface coo-
led. the maximal allowable cabin air temperature is 30° C.

During the space ﬂight, a ground control experiment was run in an identical BOTEX incubator. All
activities performed on BOTEX in orbit were also done on the ground incubator, but with a delay of 24
hours. For hypergravity studies, we chose 3g—condi-tions. The incubator temperature was set to 27°C du-
ring housing of the cricket larvae. At the beginning of the 16-day AGF-periods, larvae had reached their
lst, 4th or 6th stage. In addition, eggs from a period of approximately 75% of embryonic development
were used. Animals were tested after termination of AGF-conditions. A ﬁrst group was investigated du-
ring post-AGF days 1 to 8. They were kept at 13°C to block molting activity and further development.
The second group was kept. at 27° C and tested during post-AGF days 15 to 16 for their behavioral and
physiological readaptation. In pg-animals from the ﬁrst group and their lg-eontrols, the patterns of the
intracerebral proj ections of peptidergic neurons from the sensorimotor centers were studied, while in 3g-
animals and their 1 g-controls from the ﬁrst group, patterns of GABAergic thoracic neurons and the de-
velopment of neuromuscular junctions were studied.

Behavioral and Neurophysiological Studies

Crickets move their head opposite to an imposed roll (roll-induced compensatory head respone,
rCHR) (Figure 1, left). In general, the standard rCHR characteristic which relates the angular head displa-
cement to the roll angle is sine-like. The rCHR amplitude which is the angle between the maximum left
and right head roll depends on the developmental stage (Horn and Foller, 1998). The larvae were rolled
around their longitudinal axis by 360° in 30° steps. The head response was video-taped from the frontal
view and analysed by a frame processing system. A lateral roll is also an effective stimulus to the position
sensitive intemeuron (PSI) of the terminal (cereal) ganglion. Its activity rate increases during roll to the
side of the dendritic tree while roll to the opposite side has mainly no signiﬁcant effect on the discharge
frequency (Sakaguchi and Murphey, 1983). The PS1 activity was recorded extracellularly from the con-
nective between the terminal ganglion and the adjacent one by means of suction electrodes (Figure 1,
right). As in the behavioral studies, animals were rolled around their longitudinal axis by 360° in 30°
steps. Statistical treatment of the behavioral and neurophysiological data were based on the non-
parametric u—test from Wilcoxon, Mann and Whitney. Samples are deﬁned by the developmental stage at
onset of altered gravitational conditions.

Neuroanatomical Studies '

Neuroanatomical studies were based on immunocytolocigal methods. Cricket larvae ﬁ'om the Neu-
rolab mission were used to explore speciﬁc effects of gravity deprivation on the expression of neuropepti-
dergic neuronal patterns from sensorimotor centers of the brain. Studies were performed with develop-
mental stages which had either hatched during the ﬁrst days of the mission, or had developed to stage 1 or
4 at onset of microgravity. They were compared with animals from the inﬂight-l g and ground-l g con-
trols. Immunocytological studies on thoracic GABAergic neurons and neuromuscular connection sites
were done in 3 g-exposed larvae and lg-controls which had developed to stages 4 and 6 at onset of 3g.

animals posture also modiﬁes the activity of the PSI; it was recorded from the connective between the terminal
ganglion and the ganglion next to it; this connective was cut and the end connected to the terminal ganglion was
suct into the recording electrode.
Pegtidergic Neurons of the Sensorimotor Center of the Brain

Visualisation of deﬁned protocerebral neurons was done using ﬂuorescence coupled antibodies for
insect neuropeptides allatostatin, CCAP, leucokinin, locustatachykinin, perisulfakinin and proctolin.
Double immunoﬂuorescent stainings were performed by using primary antibodies from mouse and rabbit.
We used the polyclonal rabbit anti-allatostatin 1 dilution 125000 or the monoclonal mouse antibody (gift
from Stay/Iowa) diluted 1:40 in 0.05 M Tris-HCl buffer (TBS) containing 0.25% Triton X-100, 2% nor-
mal goat IgG and 3% milk powder (without fat) for 48 h and 6 °C (Stay et al. , 1992). The 50 um sections
were simultanously incubated with the Cy 2-coupled goat—anti-rabbit and with Cy3-coupled goat—anti-
mouse (Jackson ImmunoResearch). The sections were mounted in Moviol (Merck, Darmstadt). The num-
ber of specimen used in the immunocytological studies on peptidergic neurons was too small for a reliable
statistical analysis but allowed a qualitative evaluation of their intracerebral branching patterns.

Thoracic GABAergic Neurons and Neuromuscular Contact Sites in Hypergravitx-exgosed Larvae

GABA was binded at a carrier protein by means of the coupling reagent glutardialdehyde (Storm-
Mathisen et al., 1983) and visualized using the PAP technique (peroxidase-antiperoxidase) with DAB
(3,3'-diaminobenzi-din—tetrahydrochlorid) as the substrate (Stemberger, 1979). The basic topographical
pattern of GABAergic thoracic motoneurons and the size of CI-somata were determined from whole

mounts. The pattern of terminals of GABAergic motoneurons (common inhibitors CI) and the number of
varicosities (boutons) was studied on the thoracic muscles M56 and LVII. They are responsible for mo—
vements of the abdomen, i.e., they work against the gravitational force in order to stabilize the position of
the abdomen. For comparison, muscles were chosen which are mainly involved in breathing or internal
stabilization of the thorax. Statistical treatment of data obtained from the studies on CIs and neuron clu-
sters was based on the non—parametric u-test from Wilcoxon, Mann and Whitney.

Fig. 2. Correlation analysis between PSI activity and rCHR obtained from larvae after a 16-day exposure to micro»
gravity (F-Og; dots) compared to data recorded in the lg-ground controls (G-lg; circles). The activity of the PSI
was described by the maximal response modulation during a complete 360° roll, the behavior by the rCHR ampli-
tude. The developmental stage at onset of microgravity is given in brackets; U indicates that the respective stage
had a unilateral extirpation 0f their gravity sense organ. During exposure to microgravity, larvae molted 2- to 3-
times; the mean stages during the measurements did not differ from the lg-ground controls. Each dot (Og-animal)
or circle (1 g-ground animal) represents an individuum; 11, number of larvae for the respective group.The data pre-
sented in this plot were recorded between post-ﬂight days 1 and 16.
RESULTS
Behavioral and Neurophysiological DeveIOpment
For all four stage groups, the mean rCHR characteristics recorded during the ﬁrst 8 post-AGF days
were sine-like. No modiﬁcation was induced by AGF-conditions for both rCHR shape and rCHR ampli-
tude. The lack of differences between AGF-animals and their 1 g-controls persisted during the 16-day pe-
riod of lg-readaptation. In contrast, the PSI revealed a signiﬁcant susceptibility to micro- and hypergra-
vity. In particular, in the stage 4-group the modulation of the activity during roll of the animal to the den—
dritic side of the PSI was reduced between postﬂight days 1 and 8 with respect to the ground controls (0g:
median 46.5 imp./5s, n=6 larvae; 1g: 71 imp./s, n=8). Normalization of the discharge modulation to stan-

dard development was observed between post-ﬂight days 15 and 16 (0g: median 89 imp./s, n=6; 1g: 86
imp./s, n=5). In stage 6-1arvae, the sensitivity of the PSI from pg-larvae was also decreased with respect
to that from the ground controls but due to the low number of larvae (0g: median 32.5 imp./s, n=2; 1g:
107 imp./s, n=3), the difference was not signiﬁcant. In all these animals, both behavioral and neurophy-
siological recordings were taken in each animal. Calculation of the correlation between the rCHR ampli-
tude and the maximal response ﬂuctuation of the PSI during a complete 360° lateral roll revealed no stati-
stically signiﬁcant correlation (Figure 2). Studies following the 16-day hypergravity exposure revealed a
hypergravity susceptibility of the stage-4 group which was not seen during the ﬁrst 8 post—3g days but
during 1 g-readaptation. In particular, stage 4-animals did not increase their mean activity ﬂuctuation bet-
ween the two recording periods while the lg-control did so. This observation is not unique, because stu-
dies on the vestibuloocular reﬂex in 3g-exposed tadpoles of the amphibian Xenopus laevis also demon-
strated a block of further development during 1 g-readaptation (Horn and Sebastian, 1996).
Neuroanatomical Studies
Expression of Pegtidergic Neuronal Patterns
In general, effects of microgravity on the development and expression of the structural patterns of
peptidergic neurons, examined in larvae from the Neurolab mission, was absent or low. The results de-
monstrated that intracerebral cell patterns from larvae stained with antibodies for CCAP (n=31 stainings),
leucokinin (n=6), locustatachykinin II (n=13), and proctolin (n=12) resembled those patterns obtained
from 1 g-controls. The intensity of neuropeptide expression determined from the extent of ﬂuorescence
was similar for most of the antibodies except for locustatachykinin—IR-structures. Neurons from 0g-
animals revealed a much higher intensity of immunoreactivity than those from their lg-controls.

neurons (= light dots) and slightly caudally from the somata in the AST-neurons. At launch, the two cricket larvae

both types of peptidergic neurons.

of high neuronal processing of environmental, sensory information with lower centers of motor pattern
generation and performance which are located in the thoracic and abdominal parts of the nervous system.
In panicular, their somata (size about 30 um) are located in the most ﬁ'ontal, dorsal region of the brain.
Their axons descend into the inferior protocerebrum, cross to the contralateral side and extend into each
of the three thoracic ganglia. Adj acent to PDSI neurons, somata of a second group of descending sulfaki-
nin neurons, the PDSZ neurons (size about 15 um), are lying. Their axons follow those from PDSl neu-
rons but do not proj ect to the thoracic and abdominal ganglion; instead, they cross to the opposite side
within the inferior protocerebrum where they develop intense arborizations, cross back to the soma side
and ascend to the tritocerebral ganglion where they terminate in a dense neurOpil. A second group of neu-
rons use neuropeptides from the allatostatin family. In Acheta, the somata (size about 40 um) of two pairs
of these allatostatin-hnmunoreactive neurons (AST-ir) are located in the anterior, medial parts of the pan
intercerebralis. Their proj ection is restricted to the inferior and superior parts of the protocerebrum. They
are the basis for an intense information ﬂow from the inferior to the superior protocerebrum. Their im-
portance also includes inhibition of endocrine and intemeuronal functions, neuromodulation, myotropic
and myoendocrine functions, and direct actions on biosynthetic pathWays (Agricola, 1997).

The studies revealed that these complex projection patterns of PDS- (n=20 stainings) and AST-
neurons (n=l4) were not affected by gravity deprivation in all developmental stages. Neither the location
of their somata nor their axonal proj ections and intracerebral arborizations were modiﬁed (Figure 3).
However, differences exist conceming the intensity of staining: (1) in PDS-neurons from all 3 stage
groups the staining intensity of the neuron somata from the microgravity animals was similar to that ob-
served in their inﬂight and ground lg-controls; (2) the staining intensity of AST—neurons of stage-l group
taken ﬁom the same slides as that from the PDSI— and PDSZ-neurons was higher in Og-larvae than in the
inﬂight and ground 1 g-controls. It is unlikely that the higher staining intensity was caused by the method
because all AST and PDS stainings were performed under identical conditions but only AST neurons we-
re affected.

Expression of GABAergic Neuronal Patterns

GABAergic thoracic neurons revealed no signiﬁcant difference between '3 g- and lg-larvae in the to-
pographical patterns of both GABAergic intemeuron clusters and common inhibitors (CI), based on nor-
malized data. In detail, the susceptibility of tcpographical arrangement was determined for two GABAer-
gic clusters, the T- and E-clusters located dorsally in the posterior and anterior part of the ganglion, re-
spectively. These clusters have clearly expressed margins and the nearest distance between the center of
the thoracic ganglion and the margin of the clusters provides a reliable measure for the topographical
arrangement if related to the width of the ganglion. This parameter was not affected by a 16-day 3 g-
exposure in larvae which hatched during or which were at stage 1, 4 or 6 at onset of 3g. Similarly, the
topographical pattern of CI-motoneurons was not affected in larvae which were exposed to 3g when they
had developed to stage 4 and 6 larvae.

Hypergravity affected the development of thoracic CI-motoneurons in a stage-related manner. In
particular, for all 3 CI-types ﬁ'om stage 4-larvae, the absolute sizes of the soma were signiﬁcantly (u-test;
p<0.02) smaller in 3g-larvae than in their lg-controls. If soma sizes were related to the ganglion width to
consider interindividual variations, differences were signiﬁcant (p<0.02) for C12 and C13 neurons. In lar-
vae from the stage 6-group, soma sizes did not differ between 3g- and lg-animals for both absolute and
relative values.

The qualitative studieson the development of the neuromuscular connection sites revealed no diffe-
rence between 1g- and 3g-reared larvae. We observed no difference between muscles for moving the ab-
domen and intrinsic thoracic muscles which should be less affected by hypergravity because they don't
have to work against the gravitational force. Although only a few animals were tested, the large interindi-
vidual variation of both the bouton and axonal terminal numbers makes it unlikely that prominent diffe-
rences can be proved even if more animals are used (Figure 5).

CONCLUSIONS

The studies have shown that identiﬁed developing neurons, the position sensitive intemeuron (PSI)
and thoracic CI-motoneurons, revealed a sensitivity to modiﬁcations of the gravitational environment. In
constrast, a behavior related to gravity was not affected by AGF conditions. We postulate that (1) modiﬁ-
cations of this behavior are induced by AP G conditions, and (2) that 1g-readaptation is extremely fast
because crickets as many other insects rely on a multi-channel gravity sensory and posture regulating sy-
stem which is composed of accessory gravity and proprioceptive organs (Horn, 1982, 1986; Horn and
Bischof, 1983). These systems measure body displacements induced by the gravitational forces similar to
the load-related pressure system in man (Massion et al., 1995), to normalize and stabilize gravity related
behavior in case of environmentally induced modiﬁcations. This hypothesis which connects at ﬁrst glance
contradictory behavioral and physiological results is supported by the lack of signiﬁcant correlations bet-
ween data recorded for different levels of sensorimotor integration, the PSI as a site of primary informati-
on processing, and the behavior as the level of highest neuronal integration (Figure 2). If this explanation
is right, crickets offer the advantage to study not only microgravity effects on the cellular level in a com-

"
"8","826 E. Horn et al.
plex organism but also the interrelation between different sensory channels deprived from their naturally
occurring input during development.

On the neuroanatomical side, identiﬁed peptidergic neurons in the brain were not affected by micro-
gravity (Figure 3), while some motor neurons within the thoracic coordination center for locomotion re-
vealed a signiﬁcant sensitivity to hypergravity (Figure 4). Despite of the negative results, we do not ex-
clude that microgravity exerts signiﬁcant effects on the development of peptidergic protocerebral neurons.
(1) The neurons in our study might not participate in gravity processing. Neurons which are connected
with the gravity sensory system will probably be affected by microgravity, either in a long-term or in a
short-term manner as shown for the PSI. (2) The time window of microgravity exposure might be critical.
For the Neurolab experiment CRISP, eggs from the last quarter of embryOnic development were selected;
they had already developed the full set of neurons at onset of pg. However, cell proliferation takes place
during the ﬁrst 30 to 50% of embryonic deve10pment (Edwards and Chen, 1979). Thus, an extension of
these studies is necessary to periods of life - during which proliferating neurons are exposed to microgra-
vity.

The smaller sizes of GABAergic motoneurons in larvae with hypergravity experience (Figure 4) can
be related to the performance of the behavioral response. In crickets and many other insects, activation of
motoneurons is mandatory for gravity reception because gravity related responses are performed only
during walking (Horn, 1986). In addition, a pr0prioceptive system of the legs records the increased
strength necessary to maintain the insect body during walking at an approximately normal posture

(Wendler, 1972), thus increasing the arousal level of the network linked to the sense of gravity. As this
arousal probably fulﬁls a physiological gating function in the gravity related network, arousal changes
during 3g-exposure might be responsible for the induced morphological modiﬁcations of CI motoneu-
rons. This hypothesis is supported by observations that the susceptibility of motoneurons to physiological
inputs (Luscher et al., 1979), the physiological activation (Davis, 1971; Zwaagstra and Kernel], 1980a)
and the number of dendritic stems (Zwaagstra and Kernell, 1980b) correlated with the soma size.

EXPERIMENTAL PERSPECTIVES
Fertilization in space or during hypergravity, and subsequent rearing has a high importance for future

studies on developmental biology. In orbit, fertilization was successful performed artiﬁcially in an am-
phibian (Xenopus: Souza et al., 1995), and by mating in a ﬁsh (Oryzias latipes: Ijiri, 1997). Inﬂight and
in-hypergravity fertilization provide the most safe approach to describe the importance of gravity on neu-
ronal proliferation, in particular in animals with a short period of embryonic life. During the Neurolab
mission, Nowakowski (Piscataway, NJ) studied the Og-sensitivity of proliferating cortical neurons in
mice. In crickets, (1) microgravity-induced modiﬁcations of cell cycle durations can be examined and
quantiﬁed in identiﬁed neurons such as the large PSI, PDS- or AST-neurons, and (2) physiological and
behavioral correlates can be determined in numbers of specimen large enough to get a reliable statistical
analysis for both direct AGF-induced consequences and long-term, residual effects. A respective proj ect
is actually in the deﬁnition phase for Space ﬂight. This project will clarify to which extent neuronal pro-
liferation is susceptible to microgravity. Fertilization of the eggs will be performed in orbit; ﬁrst instars
will be tested after landing for their behavior (geotaxis; compensatory head responses) and for their phy-
siology of the PSI. In addition, embryos will be stained for neuropeptidergic neurons located in the senso-
rimotor centers of the brain and for GABAergic neurons of the thorax.

ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS
