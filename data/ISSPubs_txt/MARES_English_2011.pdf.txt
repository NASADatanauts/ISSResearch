Introduction: International Space Station (188) crew members perform pre- and post-ﬂight
testing to assess changes in muscle strength associated with long-duration exposure to
microgravity. Currently no reliable, standardized inﬂight strength data eXist. An understanding
of the timeline of strength changes during long-duration space ﬂight will facilitate improved
exercise prescription and enhance countermeasures evaluation. The aims of this investigation
were to: 1) evaluate the test-retest reliability of a proprietary dynamometer, and 2) determine its
agreement with a standard, commercially available isokinetie dynamometer used for pre- and
post-ﬂight medical assessment testing. Methods: Six males (179.5 d: 4.7 cm; 82.0 i 8.7 kg; 31.3
i 4.0 y) and 4 females (163.2 d: 7.3 cm; 63.2 i 1.9 kg; 32.3 i 6.8 y) completed 2 sessions on a
standard, commercially available isokinetie dynamometer (NORM) and 2 sessions on the Muscle
Atrophy Research and Exercise System (MARES) in a random, counterbalanced order. Peak
torque values at 600 and 1800 - s'1 were obtained from 5 maximal repetitions of knee extension
(KB) and knee ﬂexion (KF). Total work at 1800 - s'1 was determined from the area under the
torque versus displacement curve during 20 maximal repetitions of KB and KP. Results:
Intraclass correlation coefﬁcients were relatively high for both devices (0.90 to 0.99). However,
ratios of the within-deVice standard deviation were 1.3 to 4.3 times higher 011 MARES. Only one
dependent measure, KE peak torque at 600 - s'l, exhibited good concordance between devices
(rho = 0.91) and a small average difference (8.8 i 16.7 Nm). Conclusion: MARES demonstrated
acceptable test-retest reliability. However, due to poor agreement with NORM, it is not
advisable to compare values obtained on these devices, e.g., to perform ground-based testing
using NORM and inﬂight testing with MARES.

"9","1.0 INTRODUCTION
Crew members of long-duration space expeditions complete standardized medical testing before
and after space ﬂight to evaluate changes in strength and endurance of maj 0r postural and
locomotor muscle groups. Specifically, Medical Volume B, requirement 5.3 (MEDB) requires
isokinetie testing of the extensor and ﬂexor muscles of the knee, ankle, and trunk. Testing is
conducted twice pre-ﬂight (L-180 and L-60) and thrice post-ﬂight (L+5, L+14, and L+30) using
a standard, commercially available isokinetie dynamometer. Numerous studies have established
both the validity1 and the test-retest reliability of several commercially available isokinetie
dynamometers (e.g., BiodeX, Lido, and CybeX 0r HUMAC NORM).1'13
Currently, 110 standardized, reliable inﬂight strength data eXist. In the absence of such data, there
is very little understanding of the timeline of changes in muscle strength and endurance during
space ﬂight; such a timeline Will enhance our understanding of the relative contributions of
factors such as muscle atrophy and neuromuscular changes to muscle strength losses during
space ﬂight. For example, it is unknown Whether strength losses occur in a linear fashion or
Whether they mirror those of aerobic capacity that occur mostly in the ﬁrst few weeks of space
ﬂight.14 111 a 23-day unilateral limb suspension study, de Boer et al. reported a decrease in knee
extensor torque of 1.06% - (1'1 over the ﬁrst 14 days and 0.68% - (1'1 over the following 9 days.15
A strength change timeline featuring greater losses during the ﬁrst days of ﬂight would likely
have signiﬁcant operational implications, as exercise countermeasures 0n the ISS currently are
not scheduled during the ﬁrst 7 days of ﬂight and, anecdotally, may not begin until the third
week of space ﬂight. Additionally, inﬂight strength testing capabilities Will enhance
countermeasures evaluation and facilitate improved prescription of crew members’ inﬂight
exercise programs over the duration of their ﬂight.

I

"
"10","To address this gap in inﬂight strength testing capability, the European Space Agency
(ESA) has developed the Muscle Atrophy Research and Exercise System (MARES). A MARES
unit was delivered to the International Space Station (188) in early 2010 concurrently with the
performance of this evaluation. MARES is capable of supporting a vast array of muscle tests
during space ﬂight. Operationally, the availability of MARES onboard the 188 will enable
scientists to study strength changes during—not just following—space ﬂight. However, before
use as an inﬂight strength evaluation tool, it is essential to establish MARES’s reliability and to
determine how strength parameters obtained using MARES compare with those measured using
a standard, ground-based dynamometer employed for standard medical tests.

Thus, the purpose of this investigation was two-fold: 1) to determine the test-retest
reliability of isokinetie muscle strength and endurance measurements obtained using MARES,
and 2) to quantify the agreement between muscle strength and endurance measurements obtained
on a standard, commercially available isokinetie dynamometer and MARES.

2.0 METHODS
2. 1 Subjects

Six males (179.5 d: 4.7 cm; 82.0 i 8.7 kg; 31.3 i 4.0 y) and 4 females (163.2 d: 7.3 cm;
63.2 i 1.9 kg; 32.3 i 6.8 y) volunteered to participate in this proj ect. Subj eets were required to
be recreationally active and to pass a modiﬁed Air Force Class III physical examination.

Subj eets received written and verbal explanations of the testing protocols and provided written
informed consent. The test protocols and procedures were reviewed and approved by the NASA
J ohnson Space Center’s Committee for the Protection of Human Subj eets.

"11","2.2 Equipment

Testing sessions were conducted on 2 devices: 1) a standard, commercially available
dynamometer (NORM; CSMI, 1110., Stoughton, MA), and 2) a proprietary dynamometer,
MARES (NTE-SENER, Barcelona, Spain). Both dynamometers were calibrated before data
collection per the manufacturer’s recommendations.

23 T esting

Subj eots performed 2 testing sessions each using NORM and MARES (4 total testing
sessions) using a balanced, randomized, oross-over design. During each session, peak torque
values were measured during 2 testing sets: 1) 5 maximal, discrete repetitions of isokinetio knee
extension and knee ﬂexion at 60° - s'1 (KEka60 and KFka60), and 2) 21 maximal, continuous
repetitions of knee extension and knee ﬂexion at 180° - s'1 (KEkaISO and KFkaISO). The ﬁrst
repetition of the second testing set was discarded; repetitions 2 through 21 were analyzed. Total
work was also determined for these 20 repetitions from the area under the torque versus
displacement curve (KETWISO and KFTWISO). A11 testing was performed over a 75° range of
motion (95° ﬂexion to 20° extension) that was determined from a 90° anatomical reference
measured by a goniometer. Warm up consisted of 4 submaXimal repetitions and 2 maximal
repetitions at the prescribed testing velocity before performance of that velocity-speoiﬁo testing
set; subj eots rested 2 minutes between each warm up and test set.

All testing was conducted using the right leg with the exception of one subj eot who had a
pre-existing right leg injury; for this subj eot, the left leg was used. Subj eots were positioned
uniformly on each device and the position settings recorded to enable a reproducible set up.
Subj eots completed both sessions within one device before proceeding to testing within the other.

3

"
"12","Each testing session was separated by at least 2 days. Subj eets refrained from any exercise in the
8 h before testing and from strenuous exercise 24 h prior to testing. NORM testing was
conducted by two Exercise Physiology and Countermeasures Proj eet (EXPC) personnel; MARES
testing was similar but included the addition of a MARES engineer. MARES testing used the
Science and Operations Evaluation Plan (SOEP) 7, Block 1 (600 - s'l) and Block 7 (1800 - s'l).
NORM data were obtained using the manufacturer-provided HUMAC software. MARES-
generated .txt ﬁles were reduced using a MATLAB (MathWorks, Natick, MA) script written to
extract or calculate the variables of interest. NORM data were gravity-eorreeted using a static
limb weight obtained at 200 of knee extension. For MARES, subj ect torque, not shaft torque
(both standard MARES outcome variables) was used for all data analysis.
2.4 Statistical Analyses

Reliability of dependent variables within devices was assessed by the intraclass
correlation coefﬁcient (ICC); between device reliability was determined using the ratio of the
within-deVice standard deviations. Agreement between NORM and MARES was evaluated by:
1) average difference and 95% limits of agreement, 2) a calculation of concordance (rho), and 3)
the correlation between the mean of measures versus the delta difference between measures (a
versus A). Mean of measures was calculated as the mean of all 4 testing sessions (2 using
NORM, 2 using MARES). Delta difference was calculated as the difference between the mean
of each subj eet’s 2 NORM sessions and the 2 MARES sessions. Perfect concordance was
deﬁned as rho = 1.00. Increasing values of the correlation between the mean of measures versus
the delta difference between measures (range = 0.00 to 1.00) was interpreted as an increase in
bias. All data were analyzed using STATA (StataCorp LP, College Station, TX) and Excel 2007
(Microsoft Corp, Redmond, WA).

"13","3.0 RESULTS
Intraelass correlation coefﬁcients for NORM and MARES ranged from 0.90 to 0.99
(Table 1). Within-deviee standard deviations were 1.2 to 4.3 times larger for MARES than
NORM (Table 2). Average differences between devices were high except for KEka60 (8.8 Nm;
95% limits of agreement = -23.9 to 41.5 Nm) and KEka180 (-3.3 Nm; 95% limits of agreement
= -50.8 to 44.2 Nm) (Fig 1-6). Concordance (rho) was < 0.90 for all but one dependent measure
(KEka60: rho = 0.91; Table 2, Fig 1-6). Only KEka60 exhibited a low correlation between the
mean of measures versus the delta difference between measures (0 VS. A = -0.22; Table 2).

"14","4.0 DISCUSSION

This investigation sought both to determine the test-retest reliability of isokinetio muscle
strength and endurance parameters obtained using MARES and to quantify the agreement
between muscle strength and endurance measurements obtained on a standard, commercially
available isokinetio dynamometer and those obtained using MARES. Although ICC’s were
moderate to high for all outcome variables on both devices signifying acceptable test-retest
reliability, within-deVioe standard deviations were 1.2 to 4.3 times larger for MARES than
NORM indicating somewhat lower reliability for MARES. Overall, agreement between NORM
and MARES was poor as evidenced by large average differences and 95% limits of agreement,
low concordance rho values, and high correlations between the mean of measures versus the
delta difference between measures.

The within-deVioe reliability indioes produced mixed results. On one hand, ICC values
for MARES were moderate to high for all dependent measures, suggesting reproducibility from
session 1 to 2. Conversely, ratios (MARES: NORM) of within-deVioe standard deviations were
greater than 1.0, corresponding to greater variability between sessions for MARES in
comparison to NORM. Ultimately, given the ICC values for MARES, it appears reasonable to
conclude that although MARES is more variable between sessions than NORM, MARES
nonetheless provides acceptable test-retest reliability.

The three statistical measures employed to determine agreement between NORM and
MARES yielded singular results: of the siX dependent measures, only KEka60 showed any
promise as a parameter for which values obtained on one device might be used as a surrogate for
the other. However, although the mean difference between devices for KEka60 was small (8.8

6

"
"15","Nm higher on NORM, or ~5% of the mean values for this study), the 95% limits of agreement
were quite large, resulting in an unacceptable range of mean differences (-23.9 to 41.5 Nm).

Examination of the knee ﬂexion data reveals differences between the two devices that are
distinctively worse than those of the knee extension measures (Figures 2, 4, 6). This may be due
to differences in the ergonomic setup between the two devices. Whereas NORM has a deep seat
that provides support along the entire length of subj eots’ upper legs, the MARES seat is much
more shallow and terminates around mid-femur leaving the distal portion of the upper leg
unsupported. It is possible that this lack of support (and the resultant lack of restraint) allowed
subj eots to generate greater ﬂexion torques on MARES by recruiting their hip extensors in
addition to their knee ﬂexors.

Although the results of this investigation are valuable, it is important that they are Viewed
with caution. Only ten subj eots, representing a moderate range of physiologic strength, were
tested. A comprehensive reliability study employing a much larger sample would be needed to
more deﬁnitively establish MARES’ reliability and validity. An investigation of this magnitude
also would facilitate the development of regression equations that would allow us to compare
values obtained on one device to those measured on the other.

In conclusion, the results of this single, relatively small-n investigation demonstrate that
MARES is a reasonably reliable device that renders consistent measurements between two
sessions. However, MARES does not produce values that are in consistent agreement with
NORM. Thus, until further research suggests otherwise, it is not advisable to compare values
obtained on one device to those obtained on the other. This is particularly relevant to future
ﬂight studies that will use MARES as an inﬂight testing device; to compare pre- and post-ﬂight

13. ABSTRACT (Maximum 200 words)

Introduction: 188 crew members perform pre- and post-ﬂight testing to assess changes in muscle strength associated with long-

duration exposure to microgravity. Currently no reliable, standardized inﬂight strength data exist. An understanding of the timeline of

strength changes during long-duration space ﬂight will facilitate improved exercise prescription and enhance countermeasures

evaluation. The aims of this investigation were to: 1) evaluate the test-retest reliability of a proprietary dynamometer, and 2)

determine its agreement with a standard, commercially available isokinetic dynamometer used for pre- and post-ﬂight medical

assessment testing. Methods: Six males and 4 females completed 2 sessions on a standard, commercially available isokinetic

dynamometer (NORM) and 2 sessions on the Muscle Atrophy Research and Exercise System (MARES) in a random, counterbalanced

order. Peak torque values at 600 and 1800 ° s-1 were obtained from 5 maximal repetitions of knee extension (KB) and knee ﬂexion

(KF). Total work at 1800 ° s-1 was determined from the area under the torque versus displacement curve during 20 maximal

repetitions of KB and KF. Results: Intraclass correlation coefﬁcients were relatively high for both devices (0.90 to 0.99). However,

ratios of the within-deVice standard deviation were 1.3 to 4.3 times higher on MARES. Only one dependent measure, KE peak torque

at 600 ° s-1, exhibited good concordance between devices (rho = 0.91) and a small average difference (8.8 i 16.7 Nm). Conclusion:

MARES demonstrated acceptable test-retest reliability. However, due to poor agreement with NORM, it is not advisable to compare

values obtained on these devices, e.g., to perform ground-based testing using NORM and inﬂight testing with MARES.
