Abstract
Individuals WhO adapt positively to an inhospitable or extreme environment can derive beneﬁt from their experiences. This
positive effect may include an initial improvement in mental health as someone adjusts to the environment (adaptation) as well as
more sustained personal growth during the mission (salutogenesis). We reVieW relevant ﬁndings from our prior work, including
two post—mission surveys of astronauts and cosmonauts, and three studies of crewmembers during missions in a space station
simulator, the Mir space station, and the International Space Station (188). We also present new analyses showing evidence for
adaptation to 188 missions. This ﬁnding replicates our previous results from the simulation study, but this effect was not found
on the Mir. A better understanding of psychological adaptation and salutogenesis during space ﬂight should help us develop
strategies to enhance crewmembers’ in—ﬂight stress tolerance and post—ﬂight adjustment.
