future Earth observing capabilities.

The ISS builds on earlier programmes in Russia and the USA to create an
international human presence in space With physical management of Earth and
space observing instruments. Long-duration science experiments were performed on
Skylab (1973—1974), Salyut (1974—1975) and Mir (1986—2001) programmes (Evans
et al. 2000).

Today’s ISS programme involves 16 countries from around the world. The
Partner States, Who are signatories to the Intergovernmental Agreement signed in
1998, are the USA, Canada, Japan, Russia and 11 European nations: Belgium,

contributions as well, through bilateral agreements With NASA. The 16 countries
are combining forces not only on the manufacture of the ISS but also on its use.
Within many of the research disciplines, international collaborative working groups
are constructing research plans that share research equipment, consequently
preventing unnecessary duplication and optimizing research return (Bartoe 2000).
Two key questions about the scientific utility of the ISS have surfaced repeatedly
in the Earth Science community since the conception of the ISS:
' What can the ISS give the Earth Science community that current and planned
satellite platforms do not already offer?
' Why is it important to have a human presence in space?
This article focuses on providing answers to these questions through a discussion of
m the Characteristics of the ISS platform and orbit. We describe the ISS structure
g details, current and proposed instruments, orbital Characteristics, and instrument
g accessibility by crew. The primary objective of this paper is to show how the Earth-
E observing instruments on ISS complement current satellite-based Earth-observing
8 sensors.

2 2. Description of the ISS and its environment
% The ISS is a multi-module facility designed to conduct a broad spectrum of scientific
35) research in low Earth orbit and establish a permanent, internationally-based human
5 presence in space. The description that follows is partly based on the requirements
3% published in the ISS System Specification Document SSP-41000A (International
£4 Space Station Program 1994). The present ISS configuration grew out of the
g initia1 designs for Space Station Freedom, its predecessor, Which was subsumed
E into the ISS in the early 1990s. The initial orbital inclination for Space Station
3 Freedom was 28.60, Which limited Earth-observation activities to the tropics
<mﬁ With only high oblique angle Views of any latitudes north and south of 300. With
<ﬁ the inclusion of the Russian Space Agency into the programme in 1993, and the
E need for the use of Russian vehicles for logistics, the station’s orbital inclination
3‘ increased to 51.60, consistent With Russian requirements to have the ISS overﬂying
E Russia to make use of Russian command and control capabilities. With this
E inclination shift, the amount of the Earth’s surface available to Earth observations
g increased dramatically, turning the ISS into a highly useful orbital Earth
8 observatory for the next 15 years of planned operation (Eppler er al. 1996,
Chabrow 1998).
2.1 ISS orbital characteristics
ISS Will be able to observe the Earth, its atmospheres, oceans and landforms. From
the 51.60 inclination, the ISS orbit covers approximately 75% of the inhabited land
surface of the Earth, and over about 95% of the human population (Eppler er al.
1996). The station passes over the same location roughly every 3 days, and over the
same location With the same approximate lighting roughly every 3 months (see
figurel; Robinson and Evans 2002). The ISS offers a unique opportunity for
research over tropical areas. Tropical regions are Cloud covered much of the year;
this makes the likelihood of obtaining a lengthy series of imagery over a specific
region of the tropics unlikely With most sensors. However, because the ISS Will
provide instruments With image access to the same location every 3 days, the highest

5; 2.2 155 payload support characteristics
g The 188 Will accommodate payloads in both an internal pressurized environment
43 and an external unpressurized environment. Internal payloads Will make use of an
2 exceptional optical quality Window in the US Laboratory Module, and a payload
35 rack that Will accommodate payloads up to 0.8 m3 in volume using the Window. The
E optical quality Window and its sensor support rack is called the Window
5» Observational Research Facility (WORF). The internal environment offers the
g obvious advantage of allowing payloads to operate Without the necessity of vacuum
'3 rating, radiation hardening and the ability to operate Within a severe thermal
“a regime. However, internal payloads Will be limited to those payloads that can make
5 use of the radiometric transmission of the fused silica Window, Which favours the
Q Visible and near-infrared (Eppler er al. 1996).
Until the Columbia accident, Space Shuttles serviced the ISS several times a year.
When ﬂight schedules resume, Shuttle ﬂights Will provide the opportunity for
experiment (payload) deployment. Furthermore, instruments can be recovered for
periodic calibration, repair or maintenance and then redeployed, greatly improving
the quality of the data set recovered. The 188 also offers scientists interaction With
their payloads directly from the ground and minor servicing by astronauts,
potentially improving the utility and quality of the research data.
2.3 External payload accommodations
External payloads Will be installed on external payload attach points, mounting
either directly to the 188 main truss structure or to an external pallet that Will allow
a single attach point to accommodate multiple small payloads. In addition to the

"
"5","2616 J. Gebelein and D. Eppler
truss attach points, external platforms attached to the ESA Columbus module and
the Japanese Experiment Module (JEM) Will also accommodate external payloads.
The JEM is built by Japan’s National Space Development Agency (NASDA) and
has three major components: the JEM Exposed Facility (J EM-EF); the J EM
Pressurized Module (JEM-PM) and the JEM Pressurized Section (JEM-ELM-PS)
(Space Station User’s Guide 2003). External attach points are presented below in
figure2 (computer simulation courtesy of NASA 2003).
As there are external and internal attach sites for various payloads, the ISS Will
prove a useful platform for gaining insight into payload degradation over time. Both
Visual inspection of the payloads and automated monitoring Will advance our
understanding of how different materials that house sensors react to zero gravity,
internal and external space environments.
g 2.4 Internal pressurized payload accommodations
3 The US Laboratory Module contains the WORF for Earth observations. Currently,
5 nine payloads (sensors to be maintained in WORF) are approved for development.
N There is no formal programme to choose among potential sensors on a competitive
% basis. The selection process is based on funding and availability of resources (space,
2 power, communications) on the ISS. Because of the significant interest in new
3 WORF payloads, a WORF users group has been chartered to educate payload
5:3 developers as to the design of WORF and the operational capabilities of the ISS.
g The WORF user group is being organized by the ISS Payloads Office in cooperation
D With the Space and Life Sciences Directorate at J ohnson Space Center. An
é additional goal of the group is to determine overlaps in proposed payload plans, and
”:3 to establish synergism between payloads in terms of specific equipment that will
8 need to be developed. For instance, many payloads Will require mass storage devices
4% for holding data for either eventual downlink or physical transfer of payload data.
2 Therefore, rather than have many payloads all develop their own device, there may
m be benefits to joint development of such hardware, such as reduced research and
2t development costs.

3. Advantages of the ISS platform
Potential advantages of the ISS as a remote sensing platform come from the
potential for short-term studies, conﬁguration of instruments and from the
differences between ISS orbital tracks and orbital tracks typical of most remote
sensing satellites. These advantages are discussed more thoroughly below.

A remote sensing opportunity unique to ISS is the facility to test, calibrate and
compare instruments. The ISS can host many instruments designed for different
measurements such as Wind speed, ocean wave height, radar pulses, atmospheric
ﬂuctuations, optical features on land atmosphere and water bodies. These sensors
can be compared because geometric parameters can be controlled. All the sensors
Will have the same altitude and attitude, obtain images at the same time and date,
With the same lighting conditions, through the same atmospheric conditions. The

E opportunity exists to directly compare how the different sensors overlap and
<3 complement each other in their spectral and spatial resolutions. This Circumstance
g also offers an opportunity for calibration of sensors as they are being compared and
3 contrasted to other sensors of similar purpose and design.

2: ISS attitude control allow for testing instruments in orientations that are oblique
:3 to the Earth’s surface. ISS lighting precession provides opportunities to test and
% plan observations, taking advantage of different solar illuminations.

T The ability to service sensors through Space Shuttle ﬂights provide opportunities
35) for payload development as well as sensor servicing and repair. Earth-obserVing
5 satellites cost millions of dollars to build, launch and maintain. There have been
“g several cases (SPOT 3 for example) of such an investment wasted because of some
% malfunction in the sensor. With a platform such as the ISS, an instrument that
g malfunctions may be retrieved and repaired Within the station, then reintroduced
E into orbit. Thus, this capacity of the ISS offers What has never been available before,
g a semi-permanent platform for repairs and/or maintenance on current and future
<mﬁ sensors that malfunction after entry into orbit. This is obviously not the main
<t function of the ISS but With a permanent manned presence, this kind of attention
E Will be potentially available.

E 4. Review of Earth remote sensing satellites and capabilities

CG

% To better understand Earth observations from the ISS, other satellite-based sensors
5 With varied purposes are presented and compared to those instruments onboard and
Q planned for the ISS.

The Earth Observing Programme began in 1991 When NASA launched a
programme to study the Earth as an environmental system, currently entitled the
Earth Science Enterprise (ESE). The ESE has three core facets: earth-obserVing
satellites, an advanced data system, and teams of scientists Who Will analyse the
data. Research subjects include land surfaces, polar ice sheets, glaciers, water and
ecosystem processes, clouds, water and energy cycles, oceans, Chemistry of the
atmosphere, and water and ecosystem processes. There have been two major phases
of the ESE Programme. Phase I consisted of Space Shuttle missions, orbital satellites
and various ground-based and aerial studies. Phase II commenced in December
1999 With the launch of the ﬁrst Earth Observing System (EOS) satellite Terra
(previously AM-l). EOS is the first observing system to yield integrated
measurements of Earth systems. EOS has a science component and a data system
to maintain a coordinated series of polar-orbiting and low-inclination satellites

for continuous global observations of the oceans, land surfaces, biosphere
and atmosphere (http://eospso.gsfc.nasa.gov/eos_homepage/for_educators/program_
description.php). It is beyond the scope of this paper to compare the ISS
capabilities With all Earth-observation platforms. However, we can compare the
major sensors planned for 188 to similar sensors on other platforms, and evaluate
the degree to Which data collected overlaps or is complimentary. The following
section outlines the general Characteristics of the sensors onboard each platform in
terms of specific sensor purpose, spatial and spectral resolutions. Sensors onboard
better-known satellites are paired With the sensors With similar Characteristics
onboard the ISS and compared. The comparison pairs were generally Chosen
based on spectral, spatial and temporal resolution. Tablel lists the Characteristics
of different platforms that hold sensors discussed in this paper and additional
m sensors that are not discussed but remain for the readers’ reference. Table2

3 Major uses of Ikonos data include but are not limited to orthorectification, stereo

E payloads. Digital cameras have been available for documenting the Earth ever
3» since the ﬁrst human occupation of the 188 in 2000. Earth observations using the
g ESC are coordinated through two distinct projects: CEO/ESTER (Crew Earth
23 Observations/Earth Science Toward Exploration Research) and EarthKAM (Earth
'3 Knowledge Acquired by Middle-school students). The CEO project trains
E crewmembers to take photographs of Earth that Will be of greatest value to the
Q scientific research community, and creates a daily list of the best opportunities to
photograph scientiﬁc targets and dynamic events (Robinson and Evans 2001,
Robinson et a1. 2002). About 10% of the photographs astronauts take of the Earth
are in response to these requests; the other 90% are creW-initiated photographs
taken during leisure time. The CEO project ensures that metadata are compiled for
requested and creW-initiated photographs and distributes the images and data to the
public Via the Gateway to Astronaut Photography of Earth (http://eol.jsc.nasa.gov).
Once WORF is operational, the CEO project Will transition into ESTER and
include both handheld and automated photography, Where the camera is mounted
in the WORF and controlled from the ground.

EarthKAM also uses the digital camera to photograph the Earth. It is exceptional
because middle-school students pick the image acquisition locations and university
students are involved in the space operations to control the camera during the
mission, and distribute the images to the middle schools (http://

any Window With a bracket and access to the controlling laptop computer, it Will
reside in WORF once it is operational.

TWO camera models have been used for digital Earth cameras used early on the
ISS, Kodak DCS460 and DCS760 (Robinson and Evans 2002). These simple
photographic projects are important as steps towards using the 188 as a remote
sensing laboratory. Operational pathways for command uplink and data downlink
are in place. These payloads represent projects that can achieve significant scientific
and educational results during early construction of 188. They also serve as
forerunners of the results that can be obtained in the future When more sophisticated
sensors are used in WORF. For example, early 188 results from CEO have included
remote sensing studies of coral reefs (Andrefouet and Robinson 2003) and
m vegetation (StefanOV er al. 2003).
S The spatial resolution of 188 digital photography is generally 5—30n1 With three
(3 bands (red, green and blue) in the Visible (tab1e1). Ikonos 2 also records near-
: . . .
g infrared wavelengths. A commemial product, Ikonos imagery offers spectral
g calibration, increased predictable coverage, positional accuracy, and higher spatial
3; resolution than 188 digital photography. However, 188 digital photography does
é offer an inexpensive source of very accessible, high-resolution data that does not
4,3 need the scheduled organization of Ikonos because of the human presence onboard.
E Certainly, With similar spatial and spectral resolution, the two types of data can be
g used simultaneously for remote sensing applications such as assessing land use

g 4.2 Moderate to high resolution multispectml sensors for land studies
<2: These three sensors are comparable due to the overlap in their spatial and spectral
3» resolution. Landsat and ASTER are comparable, in particular, because Landsat 7
g was designed to acquire data in synchronization With the Terra platform (Jensen
23 2000).
E 4.2.1 Sensors 0n the Landsat 7 platform. Landsat is the longest running
8 programme for acquisition of moderate resolution imagery of the Earth from
space. Landsat 7 data are used for a Wide range of remote sensing applications such
as changes in coral reef communities over time (Andrefouet er al. 2001), assessment
of forest damage (Ekstrand 1994), monitoring land use change (Seto er al. 2002),
change of urban areas (StefanOV er al. 2001) and wetland delineation (Yamagata
er al. 1996) (http://1andsat7.usgs.gOV/abouthtml, http://1tpWWW.gsfc.nasa.g0V/
landsat7/teacherkit/htn11/1s7backgr0und.html).
The latest platform, Landsat 7, launched in 1999, features the Enhanced Thematic
Mapper (ETM +) instrument. It has the same spatial and spectral Characteristics as
Landsat 4 and 5 for bands 1—5 and 7, 60 x 60m spatial resolution for the thermal
band (previously 120 X 120m), and a 15 X 15m panchromatic band (0.52—0.90 ,um)
(Jensen 2000).
4.2.2 ASTER — Terra platform. The Advanced Spaceborne Thermal Emission and
Reﬂection Radiometer (ASTER) is one of five sensors on the Terra platform. As a

"
"11","2622 J. Gebelein and D. Eppler

group, the Terra instruments gather data on land cover, the Earth’s energy budget,
aerosols, clouds and phytoplankton. For the comparative purposes of this paper, we
only focus on ASTER, although the other sensors are listed for the readers’
convenience in table 2.

ASTER is the only instrument with a high spatial resolution (15—30 m) on Terra
with broad coverage of the Visible and infrared. Because of ASTER’s high spatial
resolution, it serves as an image validation source for the coarser resolution sensors
on the same platform. ASTER provides valuable data for identifying land cover
change at a comparatively higher resolution (Abrams 2000, Carlson and Arthur
2000). Other applications of ASTER data include analysis of glacier processes
(Bishop et al. 2000), soil moisture studies (Carlson et al. 2001), forest mapping
(Gillespie er al. 1995), and effects of Climate change in arid environments (Havstad

2 er al. 2000) (ASTER homepage: http://asterweb.jpl.nasa.gov/).
§ 4.2.3 AgCam — ISS. AgCam is an ISS sensor developed by the Upper Midwest
g Aerospace Consortium (UMAC) to provide farmers and ranchers with near real-
; time acquisition of high-resolution (10m) Visible and near-infrared imagery of their
2: land. Imagery of ranch or farmland will assist farmers in decisions regarding weed
:3 control, rangeland stocking rates and precision agriculture methods. These data will
% be downlinked with a latency of approximately 24 hours, and will be used to
T produce an Normalized Vegetation Difference Image (NDVI), which will then be
55) uploaded to a public access website for use by farmers and ranchers that are part of
5 the five-state UMAC area (North Dakota, South Dakota, Montana, Idaho and
8 Wyoming). AgCam will be mounted in the Space Station’s WORF (http://
CG . .
% www.umae.org/new/nwnd.htn1). At present, AgCam images Will only be made of
g the UMAC area, primarily in response to the UMAC constituency, which funded
E the development of the camera, and partially as a limitation of the downlink
g capability of the 188. In particular, instrument data buffers have been designed to
<mﬁ have a capacity capable of accepting the volume of data generated in a single pass of
< the UMAC area with the sensor running full-time; the AgCam team deﬁnes this as
E ‘survey mode’. It then takes several hours for those data to be downlinked to ground
3‘ stations before the sensor is then available for new data takes. However, UMAC has
E recognized that the AgCam sensor could be used for additional targets outside the
8 UMAC area, particularly during the northern hemisphere winter when no
E agricultural activity takes place in the UMAC area. It has been decided that
8 AgCam operations will be confined initially to the UMAC area as the ground
operations team gains experience in operating the camera and sensor system. It is
likely that after the ﬁrst season of use, AgCam may be available to image other
areas, pending agreements with the UMAC management. Interested individuals can
Visit the UMAC website to find out more details about AgCam (http://
www.umae.org/content/sensors/agcam.shtml).
4.2.4 Comparison. The Landsat, ASTER and AgCam instruments overlap
spectrally, spatially and in terms of purpose. The Landsat and Terra platforms
operate at 98.20 inclination, operate at similar perigee/apogee orbits, have similar
periods and were created to complement each other. Because of this overlap, and
because of the different mission objectives of each sensor, it is possible for each to
fill a data niche in various studies. For example, Landsat’s primary mission is to
gather imagery of land masses, coral reefs and coastal boundaries and link changes
to those environments to global change (NASA and USGS 1999, USGS 2003). The

"
"12","ISS Earth observation complement current satellite sensors 2623
ASTER mission, by comparison, is to gather data describing emissivity, reﬂectance,
elevation and land surface temperature; all factors that can be linked to the
transformation of land forms and global Change. Scientists have already used
ASTER in conjunction With Landsat ETM+ to study environmental indicators of
global change such as glacial features (Wessels er al. 2001). In addition to these two
sensors addressing the issues of global change through land cover and emissivity
studies, AgCam Will provide complementary data focusing on agricultural features
in varied landscapes, woodland Vitality and the after-effeets of ﬁre on a landscape.
AgCam’s data Will supplement the ASTER and Landsat data With their high repeat
coverage of these signiﬁcant landscape elements. In addition to yielding supple-
mental coverage, AgCam is an ideal sensor for those interested in a high-resolution
(10m), rapid reVisit, and inexpensive NDVI product. Both ASTER and Landsat
m data have also been used for NDVI analyses but at coarser spatial resolutions of 15
§ and 30m, respectively. Additionally, the 3-day reVisit time of AgCam Will allow for
3 analysis of more minute vegetation changes utilizing NDVI because of its higher
3 temporal resolution as opposed to Landsat (16 days) and ASTER (4—16 days).
8 Based on the high spatial and temporal resolution of AgCam, users may derive very
8‘, precise seasonal and interannual variations from multi-temporal series of NDVI
é that can be associated With additional ecological variables. These variables could
‘53 include temperature, precipitation and daily radiation. Combining the derived
E NDVI data With these types of variables can give users insight into plant health and
E photosynthetic efficiency.

g 4.3 Atmospheric sensors
E 4.3.1 SAGE II. Stratospheric Aerosol and Gas Experiment (SAGE) sensors have
E been deployed on satellites since 1984. SAGE II was launched in 5 October 1984 on
E the Earth Radiation Budget Satellite (ERBS) and had an anticipated lifespan of 2
<mt years. It continues to provide scientists With measurements of attenuated solar
<ﬁ radiation through the Earth’s limb in seven Channels. The applications using SAGE
E II data focus on the middle and lower atmosphere and the levels at Which various
3‘ aerosols (nitrogen dioxide, water vapour and ozone for example) become extinct
E (Mongosing 2002a). Examples of SAGE II studies include atmospheric analysis
8 after a major volcanic eruption (Brogniez er al. 1992, Brock er al. 1993),
E tropospheric water vapour distribution (Chiou er al. 1993) and ozone measurements
8 (Margitan er al. 1989).
4.3.2 SAGE III — Russian Space Agency Meteor-3M Platform and ISS. On 10
December 2001 another SAGE instrument was launched into orbit onboard the
Russian Space Agency’s Meteor-3M platform to gather solar data ranging between
50 and 800 North and 30 and 500 South. The high northern latitude coverage offers
insight into the factors contributing to ozone depletion during boreal Winter and
also provides imagery that complements the mid- and lOW-latitude coverage yielded
by SAGE II and other SAGE III missions (Mongosing 2002b).

There is a second facet to the SAGE III programme. SAGE III has been
considered for ﬂight on the ISS payload system in 2005, pending the installation of
an Express Pallet. The mission of SAGE III is to acquire lunar and solar occultation
data each moonrise and sunset, respectively. The SAGE III instrument on the ISS
Will function as a replacement for the SAGE II sensor that has been in operation
since 1984.

"
"13","2624 J. Gebelein and D. Eppler
The SAGE III instruments are orbital counterparts for each other. SAGE III/
Meteor is in a sun-synchronous orbit With high latitude coverage and SAGE III/ISS
Will be in an inclined orbit that yields almost global coverage over the course of
approximately 1 month (Mongosing 2002a).
4.4 Moderate resolution multispectml sensors
These sensors are compared because of overlapping spectral and spatial
Characteristics.
4.4.1 MODIS — Terra. The Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer
(MODIS) gathers data in 36 spectral bands With 250 m to 1 km spatial resolution to
help scientists evaluate global change through changes in land, ocean and lower
m atmospheric processes. More speciﬁcally, MODIS data are used to assess land,
g cloud and aerosol boundaries; determine properties of ocean colour, phytoplankton
Ga) and biogeoehemistry; determine atmospheric water vapour levels (Gao et al. 2003);
g acquire information pertaining to surface and Cloud temperatures (Schmidt et al.
a 1995); and assess atmospheric temperature variation (King et al. 2003) (http://
3; modis.gsfc.nasa.gOV/about/specshtml). Comprehensive reviews of MODIS capabil-
§ ities for ocean science and Cloud observations were completed by Esaias er al. (1998)
*5 and Platnick er al. (2003), respectively.
.3: 4.4.2 AVHRR — NOAA POES. The Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer
5 (AVHRR) instrument is carried on the National Oceanic and Atmospheric
8 Administration’s (NOAA’s) Polar Orbiting Environmental Satellites (POES). The
& AVHRR sensor is a polar orbiting sensor that provides for onboard data collection
2 from all spectral Channels (Hastings 2001). AVHRR data have been used extensively
g in many venues of research including but not limited to land cover map creation
‘5 (Loveland er al. 1991), predicting percentage forest cover (Zhu and Evans 1994),
2 mapping vegetation—soil—climate complexes (Azzali and Menenti 2000) and
Q measuring emissivity and land surface temperature With AVHRR data (Li and
E Becker 1993).
5 4.4.3 SeaWiFS. The SeaWiFS instrument resides on the SeaStar satellite and was
g launched into low Earth orbit in 1997. The major objective of the SeaWiFS sensor
E has been to collect ocean colour data for a minimum of 5 years, and to link these
g data With significant oceanic biological parameters that inﬂuence global change and
8 help to determine the ocean’s role in the global carbon cycle. The Visible and
infrared channels available at 1km spatial resolution allow researchers to study
ocean colour at global or regional scales. SeaWiFS has been used to examine marine
phytoplankton primary production, variability in its Chlorophyll, and predict the
location and magnitude of blooms. More speciﬁcally, SeaWiFS imagery has been
used to identify upwelling events (Ribeiro er al. 2005), identify spatial and temporal
variability in phytoplankton biomass (Korb er al. 2004), and aid in change detection
of shallow coral reef environments (Andrefouet er al. 2001).
4.4.4 Focus — ISS. Focus is an infrared sensor system that Will detect and classify
high temperature events such as volcanic activity, pollutant gas emissions, smoke
detection and vegetation fires. One of the main goals of the Focus research group is
to streamline near real-time data ﬂow from the sensor to ground-based teams to
provide the most up-to-date disaster information. The Focus instrument has a
synchronized co-registration of infrared and Visible bands to help assess the

"
"14","ISS Earth observation complement current satellite sensors 2625
potential for autonomous orbital detection and classification of hot spots on the
surface of the Earth. Focus is comprised of three external sensors: the Main Sensor
Imager, the Fore Field Sensor (FFS) and the Main Sensor Fourier Spectrometer
(http://www.fuchs-gruppe.eom/eo/focus/ohb_frame.htm).

4.4.5 Comparison. The AVHRR, MODIS, SeaWiFS and Focus instruments have
different spatial resolutions that can be applied to various research questions. Lower
resolution data are used to address general hypotheses about a larger area. All of the
sensors can also be used to analyse how elements of the Earth’s atmosphere are
changing, such as addition of smoke, pollution and varying levels of cloud
temperature due to anthropogenic or other processes. In the ease of an ephemeral
event such as a hurricane or volcanic eruption, these instruments could be used
complementarily to help researchers to analyse the vertical and horizontal aspects of

2 atmospheric pollution and potential damage extent. Based on their overlapping

8 spectral resolution and reVisit times, AVHRR and MODIS can be used to validate

“g the other’s data. The same could be said for SeaWiFS and Focus. This group of

3 sensors is also useful for conducting multi-seale analyses. With Focus yielding

0“: images having the highest spatial resolution (68 m and 340m), followed by MODIS

‘0. (250m, 500m and 1km), SeaWiFS (1km) and AVHRR (1km), data could be

2 collected repeatedly over certain areas at coarse and high temporal resolutions

E provided by these sensors. The combination of these varied reVisit times, spatial and

3:5 spectral resolutions, allows for land-based, marine and atmospheric investigations

: . . . . . .

5 to be conducted as 1nd1V1dual topics or as an integrated approach to regional or

8 global research questions.

E 5. Other payloads 0n the ISS — planned

E Several other Earth-obserVing instruments are planned for the ISS. We provide brief

3 descriptions of these sensors. Others have been discussed in the ISS literature (e.g.

g Stern er al. 2002) as potential sensors for the ISS that would provide utility to the

E Earth Science community.

5 5.1 HICO (formerly CRESPO)

G)

23 HICO is an additional payload that was planned for the WORF. The purpose of the

'E Coral Reef Ecosystem Speetro-Photometry Observatory (CRESPO) was to assess

E the status of coral reef ecosystems worldwide using a multispectral camera. The

Q spectral bands differed from all other multispectral sensors currently in orbit and
were designed specifically to assess coral ecosystem health (Hochberg and Atkinson
2000). The original CRESPO mission included a sensor that had high resolution
capability and four narrow multispectral bands. In-orbit ﬁlter changes and serVice
were possible, making the instrument versatile and potentially repairable in the
event of a software failure. There were also other measurements collected
simultaneously (from orbit) including sea surface temperature and ocean colour
data collection. Additionally, several in Situ measurements were to be collected
concurrent to orbital data collection, including reef spectra, sediment, and some
aerosol measurements, usually in Close proximity to areas with a large population
where sediment loads and aerosols and were thought to be high (http://
www. p gd.hawaii. edu/ ~ lucey/ cresp opaul . html).

At present, the development of CRESPO has been taken over by the Department

of Defense (DoD) and is being developed under the new project name HICO at the

"
"15","2626 J. Gebelein and D. Eppler
University of Utah and the University of Hawaii. The HICO project is expanding
the goals of the original CRESPO project to consider the Wider problem of
quantitative sensing of coastal ocean bathymetry, Which Will include, as a subset,
identifying coral reefs and reef health. For more information on the University
Earth System Science Project (UnESS) and the old version of CRESPO, see http://
WWW.Wff.Iiasa.gov/~code850/pages/uness.htm1.
6. Conclusions
The Earth-obserVing facilities on the 188 Will be an important, mid-latitude
inclination manned platform for remote sensing well into the twenty-first century.
The potential payloads on 188 are diverse, and can make significant contributions to
understanding the Earth system over the next 13 years. The constant human
2 presence on the 188 can uniquely support Earth-obserVing sensors. Sensor rotation
8 and maintenance can be provided by astronauts. Sensor and software testing can
2 also be performed.
i Human capabilities for observation, decision making, and sensor pointing
0°: facilitate the documentation of ephemeral events. Earth-obserVing data collection
‘0. by sensors can be amplified When completed by astronauts observing the Earth
2 constantly from the ISS, especially for dynamic events occurring such as volcanic
E eruption, fires or ﬂoods.
3:5 Finally, human presence can augment Earth observation through public outreach
5) and education activities. Astronaut observation of the Earth, CEO/ESTER,
8 provides extensive information about Earth observations to students, educators
a and researchers. Human observations provide an open Channel of communication
2 between the public and NASA engineers, technicians and astronauts.
8 While ephemeral events are extremely important to document, there is also the
g potential long-term Earth observation that 188 shares With all the unmanned
2 sensors’ capabilities. With its array of sensors and global repeat coverage, the 188
Q can complement current and future unmanned sensors. Sensors on the 188 that are
E similar to those on satellites can be used to help calibrate sensors on satellites, fine-
3‘ tune supporting software, and better understand signal response, sensor main-
3 tenance and other impacts of the space environment. A robust Earth observing
g programme on the 188 could complement existing observations and benefit
% development of future sensors and other space imaging instruments.
