Abstract
Background
Abundant populations of bacteria have been observed on Mir and the International Space
Station. While some experiments have shown that bacteria cultured during spaceﬂight exhibit
a range of potentially troublesome characteristics, including increases in growth, antibiotic
resistance and Virulence, other studies have shown minimal differences when cells were
cultured during spaceﬂight or on Earth. Although the ﬁnal cell density of bacteria grown
during spaceﬂight has been reported for several species, we are not yet able to predict how
different microorganisms will respond to the microgravity environment. In order to build our
understanding of how spaceﬂight affects bacterial ﬁnal cell densities, additional studies are
needed to determine whether the observed differences are due to varied methods,
experimental conditions, or organism speciﬁc responses.
Results
Here, we have explored how phosphate concentration, carbon source, oxygen availability,
and motility affect the growth of Pseudomonas aeruginosa in modiﬁed artiﬁcial urine media
during spaceﬂight. We observed that P. aeruginosa grown during spaceﬂight exhibited
increased ﬁnal cell density relative to normal gravity controls when low concentrations of
phosphate in the media were combined with decreased oxygen availability. In contrast, when
the availability of either phosphate or oxygen was increased, no difference in ﬁnal cell
density was observed between spaceﬂight and normal gravity. Because motility has been
suggested to affect how microbes respond to microgravity, we compared the growth of wild-
type P. aeruginosa to a AmotABCD mutant deﬁcient in swimming motility. However, the
ﬁnal cell densities observed with the motility mutant were consistent with those observed
with wild type for all conditions tested.
Conclusions
These results indicate that differences in bacterial ﬁnal cell densities observed between
spaceﬂight and normal gravity are due to an interplay between microgravity conditions and
the availability of substrates essential for growth. Further, our results suggest that microbes
grown under nutrient-limiting conditions are likely to reach higher cell densities under
microgravity conditions than they would on Earth. Considering that the majority of bacteria
inhabiting spacecrafts and space stations are likely to live under nutrient limitations, our
ﬁndings highlight the need to explore the impact microgravity and other aspects of the
spaceﬂight environment have on microbial growth and physiology.

"4","Background

Bacteria can sense changes in their surroundings and modulate their gene expression and
physiology to adapt to a range of environmental conditions. A unique condition that bacteria
encounter during spaceﬂight is signiﬁcantly reduced gravity, known as microgravity [1,2].
Many studies have shown that the microgravity environment encountered during spaceﬂight
can alter bacterial physiology, including increased growth rate, antibiotic resistance, and
Virulence [3]. The effects of microgravity on ﬁnal cell density have been described for
several bacterial species, including Escherichia (2011' [4-9], Bacillus subtilis [10,11], and
Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium (hereafter referred to as Salmonella) [12,13]. A
number of these studies have shown increased ﬁnal cell density during spaceﬂight, while
others have not observed signiﬁcant differences between spaceﬂight and normal gravity
conditions [14]. Interestingly, independent studies of the same species have also yielded
differing results, where some examining E. (2011' during spaceﬂight have reported increased
ﬁnal cell density [5,8], and others have reported no differences relative to normal gravity
controls [4,6]. Some studies have been repeated on multiple shuttle missions and yielded
consistent results [13,15], suggesting that these differences are likely not due to issues with
experimental design or reproducibility. As such, we hypothesize that these discrepancies may
be attributed to differences in media and culture conditions, in addition to differences in how
individual species respond to the microgravity environment.

Benoit and Klaus have suggested that differences in motility may be responsible for some of
these inconsistent observations [14]. They hypothesize non-motile bacteria have an advantage
under spaceﬂight conditions due to a lack of cell settling and the resulting increases in local
nutrient availability in the well-mixed environment, while motile cells are able to move
actively towards nutrients under both normal and microgravity conditions [14]. Indeed, a
previous spaceﬂight experiment, conducted by Thevenet et al., found that growth in
microgravity increased the ﬁnal cell density of a non-motile E. coli mutant lacking motB
relative to normal gravity, while no differences were observed with the motile parent [9].
However, further studies are needed to examine whether motility plays a universal role in
affecting microbial growth in microgravity.

Recent studies have also indicated that media conditions can modulate how microgravity
affects bacterial physiology [15-17]. Salmonella cultured in LennoX broth (LB) during
spaceﬂight exhibited increased Virulence in a murine model of infection compared to controls
where Salmonella was grown on Earth. However, the use of M9 media or the addition of the
inorganic ion components of M9 to LB was observed to mitigate the enhanced Virulence of
Salmonella induced during spaceﬂight [15]. A set of follow-up experiments tested the
individual components of M9 and showed that the addition of phosphate alone to LB could
prevent the increase in acid tolerance observed when Salmonella is grown in low shear
modeled microgravity (LSMMG) [15].

In addition to phosphate, oxygen availability may also inﬂuence how bacteria grow and
respond to the spaceﬂight environment. For example, oxygen is known to affect many
aspects of the growth and physiology of Pseudomonas aeruginosa, a facultative anaerobe,
including growth, motility, and bioﬁlm formation [18-20]. P. aeruginosa is an opportunistic
human pathogen and was attributed to the spaceﬂight infection of an astronaut during Apollo
13 [21,22]. We recently examined bioﬁlm formation by P. aeruginosa PA14, a virulent
clinical isolate [23], and shown that differences in bioﬁlm biomass observed between
spaceﬂight and normal gravity can be minimized when oxygen availability is increased [24].

"
"5","Modeling efforts have suggested that oxygen transfer rates may be decreased under LSMMG
conditions compared to normal gravity conditions [16], and a number of genes involved in
anaerobic metabolism were found to be up—regulated when P. aeruginosa PAOl, a less
virulent laboratory reference strain [25,26], was grown during spaceﬂight [17]. These
ﬁndings indicate that oxygen availability may inﬂuence bacterial responses to spaceﬂight,
and highlight the interplay between changes in the environment due to the direct or indirect
effects of microgravity, such as reduced oxygen transport, and changes in microbial
physiology. However, previous studies have not examined changes in the response of
planktonic cells to the spaceﬂight environment when oxygen availability is varied.

The methods used to investigate microbial growth during spaceﬂight may also be responsible
for some of the differences. To date, the measurement of bacterial cell density has most often
been conducted after samples were returned to Earth due to constraints imposed by the nature
of such spaceﬂight experiments [27]. The two methods of storing planktonie samples of
bacteria grown during spaceﬂight prior to analysis used most frequently are the addition of a
ﬁxative t0 the culture [6,9,28] and the storage of live samples at low temperatures [4,5]. In
the present study, we assess the use of two methods for measuring microbial cell
concentrations following growth during spaceﬂight: plate counting of live samples and ﬂow
cytometry (FCM) of ﬁxed samples. Plate counting has the advantage of allowing the
measurement of Viable cell numbers. FCM is a fast and precise method to count cells [29].
Furthermore, this method is able to directly count hundreds of thousands of cells in a single
sample, thereby facilitating the generation of statistically meaningful results.

We have investigated the effects of phosphate concentration, carbon source, oxygen
availability and swimming motility 0n the ﬁnal cell density of P. aeruginosa PA14 grown
during spaceﬂight. Here, we demonstrate that the ﬁnal cell density of P. aeruginosa is
increased during spaceﬂight when culture conditions limit the availability of substrates
required for growth. Speciﬁcally, growth during spaceﬂight led to an increase in ﬁnal cell
density when P. aeruginosa was cultured under low phosphate and low oxygen conditions.
Increased availability of either phosphate or oxygen was observed to minimize the effects of
spaceﬂight 0n the ﬁnal cell density. These ﬁndings indicate that effects of gravity on ﬁnal
cell density can be modulated by the availability of growth-limiting substrates.

Results

Two assays of ﬁnal cell density show inconsistent measurements of spaceﬂight

and normal gravity cultures grown in specialized hardware

To examine how spaceﬂight affects ﬁnal cell density, P. aeruginosa PA14 was grown aboard
the Space Shuttle Atlantis during STS-135 in specialized hardware, known as a ﬂuid
processing apparatus (FPA). FPAs have been used extensively to culture microbes during
spaceﬂight [8,13,15,17,24,30]. As shown (Additional ﬁle 1: Figure 81), FPAs are glass
barrels with a bevel 0n the side. Rubber stoppers are added to form compartments and the
bevel enables mixing of the ﬂuids from the different compartments Via a plunging action. The
ﬁrst compartment was loaded with modiﬁed artiﬁcial urine media (mAUM), which was used
because it provides a physiologically relevant environment for the study of bacterial growth
[31,32]. Understanding how microbes grow in urine aboard a spacecraft or space station may
be important for minimizing the potential for both future infections and microbial-based
failures of the essential water and waste puriﬁcation systems. Further, because mAUM is a

"
"6","chemically deﬁned medium, it can be easily manipulated to test effects of speciﬁc
compounds on ﬁnal cell density. The second compartment was loaded with cells used for
inoculation stored in PBS. For ﬁxed samples, a third compartment was ﬁlled with a 9% w/V
paraformaldehyde solution in PBS.

Cultures were grown following the experiment timeline shown in Figure 1. Prior to
inoculation, the FPAs were stored at 8°C. Following inoculation, cells were cultured at 37°C
for 72 h. A subset of the cultures were ﬁxed with paraformaldehyde immediately following
the 72 h culture period and all cultures were subsequently incubated at 8°C for approximately
48 h. This 48 h period corresponds to the time required for the shuttle to return to Earth, and
storage at 8°C during this period minimized additional cell growth of Viable cultures and
increased the stability of the ﬁxed samples [6,33]. Plate counting was conducted immediately
following shuttle landing to determine the number of Viable cells in the live samples. The
paraformaldehyde-ﬁxed samples were stained with DAPI and cell numbers were determined
by ﬂow cytometry (FCM).

addition of ﬁxative (FCM samples only) 72 h after activation. The temperature in the CGBA

Kennedy Space Center in parallel with spaceﬂight samples.

While we anticipated data from plate counting and FCM measurements of ﬁnal cell
concentration would yield similar results and reinforce each other, our analysis showed very
different results from the two methods under a number of conditions. This discrepancy
between the two methods was most pronounced when cells were cultured in mAUM
containing 2 mM glucose (mAUMg). In mAUMg, FCM data indicated that growth during
spaceﬂight led to increased cell numbers compared to normal gravity, while plate counting
data showed no difference in the ﬁnal cell density between spaceﬂight and normal gravity
(Figure 2). However, when the phosphate concentration was increased from 5 to 50 mM
(mAUMg-high Pi), FCM and plate counting data exhibited similar trends (Figure 2).

during spaceﬂight. Wild-type P. aeruginosa was cultured under normal gravity (black bars)
and spaceﬂight (gray bars) conditions in mAUMg containing 5 mM or 50 mM phosphate. (a)
The number of Viable cells in unﬁxed samples was measured by plate counting. (b) The

differences between normal gravity and spaceﬂight for each experimental condition were
analyzed by 0ne-tailed t-test: *p < 0.05. Error bars indicate SD; N = 3.

In order to resolve the discrepancies between plate counting data and FCM data, we
conducted additional ground-based experiments where we focused on the effects of storing
cells at 8°C following cell growth. Post-growth storage was targeted because bacterial storage
at low temperatures is known to affect bacterial physiology and Viability [34,35]. Although
the FCM samples were also stored at 8°C for 48 h following cell growth, we note that the

"
"7","paraformaldehyde ﬁxative was added prior to lowering the incubator temperature. To test the
role of post-growth storage conditions on cell Viability, we compared ﬁnal cell concentrations
obtained when cells were plated immediately following growth, or after post-growth storage
at 48 h at 8°C. The same timeline and temperature proﬁle from the spaceﬂight experiments
(Figure 1) was followed. As shown in Figure 3, results from both plate counting and FCM
showed that P. aeruginosa cultured in mAUMg exhibited a 7- to 9-fold decrease in cell
numbers following storage at 8°C for 48 h (p < 0.01, two-way ANOVA). Our results indicate
that measurements of cell numbers following storage at low temperatures post-growth may
not accurately represent the amount of growth that occurred in the FPAs, and differences in
ﬁnal cell densities observed between spaceﬂight samples and ground controls may be
confounded by differences in death rates. Because it is not currently feasible to plate count
directly following the growth period during spaceﬂight, FCM measurements of cells ﬁxed
immediately following growth provide more reliable information with respect to how much
biomass was formed during the growth period. Hereafter, we will describe only the results
obtained by FCM of samples ﬁxed immediately after the growth period.

growth storage at 8°C for 48 h (+) by plate counting (black bars) or FCM (gray bars). For
FCM samples, ﬁxative was added immediately following growth (—) or after post-growth
storage at 8°C for 48 h (+), and cells were stored at 4°C prior to staining and assessing cell
numbers. Diamonds indicate results from two-way ANOVA: 00p < 0.0] . Error bars, SD; N =
3.

Phosphate availability modulates the effect of spaceﬂight on ﬁnal cell density
P. aeruginosa grown in mAUM during spaceﬂight exhibited a modest, but signiﬁcant, 1.5-
fold increase in ﬁnal cell density compared to normal gravity controls (p < 0.01, one-tailed t-
test) (Figure 4(a)). We also measured ﬁnal cell densities in mAUM where the concentration
of phosphate was increased from 5 mM, which is the concentration found in normal human
urine [32], to 50 mM (mAUM-high Pi). In the ease of mAUM-high Pi, no difference in the
ﬁnal cell density was observed between spaceﬂight and normal gravity (Figure 4(a)).

Figure 4 Effect of spaceﬂight on ﬁnal cell density of P. aeruginosa. Wild-type P.
aeruginosa and a motility mutant (AmotABCD) were cultured under normal gravity (black
bars) and spaceﬂight conditions (gray bars) in FPAs with (a) solid inserts or (b) GE inserts.
Cells were cultured in mAUM or mAUMg containing 5 mM or 50 mM phosphate. Final cell
density was measured by FCM. Effect of phosphate on ﬁnal cell density is signiﬁcant in
FPAs with solid inserts [two-way ANOVA, 00p < 0.01]. Effect of gravity on ﬁnal cell
density is signiﬁcant in 5 mM phosphate conditions in FPAs with solid inserts [two-way
ANOVA, p < 0.01]. Statistical differences between spaceﬂight and normal gravity for each
experimental condition was analyzed by one-tailed t-test: **p < 0.01; *p < 0.05. Error bars
indicate SD; N = 3.

In addition to phosphate, we also examined the effect of carbon source on the response of P.
aeruginosa to the spaceﬂight environment. Changing carbon source is known to affect P.
aeruginosa metabolism and growth rate [36-38]. To assess the effect of carbon source on P.
aeruginosa growth during spaceﬂight, we substituted the 2 mM citrate found in mAUM with
2 mM glucose (mAUMg). As shown in Figure 4(a), P. aeruginosa grown in mAUMg during

"
"8","spaceﬂight showed a 4-fold increase in ﬁnal cell density compared to normal gravity controls
(p < 0. 05, one-tailed t-test). Similar to mAUM-high Pi, no difference between ﬁnal cell
densities in spaceﬂight and normal gravity cultures was observed when the phosphate
concentration was increased to 50 mM (mAUMg-high Pi) (Figure 4(a)). These results show
that while substituting citrate with glucose does not affect the ﬁnal cell density of P.
aeruginosa grown during spaceﬂight, altering phosphate concentration does affect ﬁnal cell
density (p < 0. 0] , two-way ANOVA), and that there is an interaction between the
microgravity environment and phosphate concentration, as factors affecting ﬁnal cell density,
that is statistically signiﬁcant (p < 0. 05, two-way ANOVA). This ﬁnding indicates that
increasing phosphate availability can minimize the effect of spaceﬂight on ﬁnal cell density
of P. aeruginosa.

Oxygen availability modulates the effect of spaceﬂight on ﬁnal cell density

We hypothesized that the effects of spaceﬂight on ﬁnal cell density might differ between
anaerobic and aerobic conditions. To test this hypothesis, we substituted the solid inserts used
in the experiments described above with gas exchange (GE) inserts that allow the movement
of gases Via a gas-permeable membrane. GE inserts have been used previously to increase the
oxygen availability and promote aerobic growth in FPAs [13,15,17,39]. Unlike cultures
grown with solid inserts (Figure 4(a)), P. aeruginosa cultured in mAUM with GE inserts
showed no difference in ﬁnal cell density between normal gravity and spaceﬂight regardless
of phosphate concentration (Figure 4(b)). Similar results were obtained for samples with GE
inserts cultured in mAUMg and either 5 or 50 mM phosphate (Figure 4(b)). These results
indicate that, similar to phosphate, increased oxygen availability can reduce the effects of
spaceﬂight on ﬁnal cell density.

Role of swimming motility on spaceﬂight ﬁnal cell density

We also examined the effects of spaceﬂight on a motility mutant, AmotABCD, which lacks
the motor proteins required for ﬂagella-mediated swimming [40]. In mAUMg, AmotABCD
cultured during spaceﬂight showed a 3-fold increase in ﬁnal cell density compared to its
normal gravity counterpart (p < 0.05, one-tailed t-test), while in mAUMg-high Pi there was
no difference in ﬁnal cell density (Figure 4(a)). We also cultured AmotABCD with GE inserts
and observed no difference in the ﬁnal cell density between spaceﬂight and normal gravity
controls, regardless of phosphate availability (Figure 4(b)). Overall, we did not observe any
signiﬁcant differences between the ﬁnal cell density of wild-type P. aeruginosa and the non-
motile mutant under any of our experimental conditions (p > 0.05, three-way ANOVA;
factors: gravity, phosphate, motility).

Microscopy of planktonic cells does not show aggregation of P. aeruginosa
PA14

Increases in aggregation and clumping of planktonio cells have been observed for Salmonella
grown during spaceﬂight [13] and P. aeruginosa PAOl grown in LSMMG [41]. To assess
whether spaceﬂight conditions induced cellular aggregation in our spaceﬂight experiments,
we observed the ﬁxed P. aeruginosa PA14 planktonio cells by differential interference
contrast (DIC) microscopy. Interestingly, no clumps or aggregates with more than ~3 cells
were observed following growth in mAUM with 5 or 50 mM phosphate during spaceﬂight or
on Earth (Figure 5), or under any of the other media conditions tested (data not shown).

Discussion

We have shown that, within the constraints of our spaceﬂight experiments, FCM of ﬁxed
cells provides more reliable measurements of ﬁnal cell numbers of planktonie cells grown in
FPAs during spaceﬂight and on Earth. Although ﬁxing the cells prevents one from
distinguishing between live and dead populations, the effects of post-growth storage at 8°C
on cell Viability indicate that the Viability of cells during post-growth storage should be
assessed on Earth prior to spaceﬂight studies, and suggest that the use of Viable cell
measurements should be avoided when possible. Further, a recent study has shown that
changes in growth rate that occur when Micrococcus luteus is cultured in simulated
microgravity conditions can be lost within 7 h of exposure to normal gravity [42]. Changes in
resistance to oxidative stress were similarly lost within 2 h after Staphylococcus aureus cells
were removed from LSMMG conditions [43]. Of course, for certain spaceﬂight studies, such
as those assessing changes in Virulence 0r antibiotic resistance, the use of Viable cells is
essential. Interestingly, the observation that Salmonella Virulence is increased following
growth during spaceﬂight [13], which has been conﬁrmed by both additional spaceﬂight and
simulated microgravity experiments [15], indicates that at least some of the physiological
changes that occur during spaceﬂight are maintained when the samples are returned to Earth
and assayed or used immediately. In the Salmonella Virulence studies, Wilson and eo—workers
stored cells in fresh media at ambient temperature following growth during spaceﬂight
[13,15]. In our experiments we did not use this approach in order to avoid increases in cell
number due to the additional media. Together these results highlight the careful, nuanced
approach that must be taken in order to conduct spaceﬂight experiments that provide results
that truly reﬂect how the cells grow and adapt to the spaceﬂight environment.

We have systematically studied the effects of spaceﬂight 0n the ﬁnal cell density of P.
aeruginosa, assessing factors known to affect bacterial growth such as phosphate and oxygen
availability, carbon source and motility. We have demonstrated that differences between ﬁnal
cell density of P. aeruginosa cultured during spaceﬂight and on Earth are dependent on
nutrient and oxygen availability. Speciﬁcally, spaceﬂight increased the ﬁnal cell density of P.
aeruginosa when it was grown with low phosphate and low oxygen availability. When either
phosphate or oxygen availability was increased, no difference between normal gravity and
spaceﬂight was observed.

Similar to previous observations that increasing phosphate concentration or supplementing
media with the inorganic ion components of M9 media, which includes phosphate, can
minimize the effects of spaceﬂight 0r LSMMG 0n Virulence and acid tolerance of Salmonella
[15], we observed that increasing the phosphate concentration from 5 to 50 mM in the
artiﬁcial urine media minimized the differences between spaceﬂight and normal gravity ﬁnal
cell densities of P. aeruginosa. Berry et al., have also shown that phosphate uptake by
Saccharomyces cerevisiae increased when cultured during spaceﬂight [44]. Taken together,
these ﬁndings may indicate that phosphate plays a key role in microbial responses to
spaceﬂight conditions. However, additional studies are needed to determine whether
phosphate is acting simply as a growth-limiting nutrient, or if the effect is more speciﬁc.

"
"10","While cells grown with 5 mM phosphate are not likely to be starved for this essential
nutrient, increasing phosphate concentration has been shown to increase the growth rate of P.
aeruginosa [45]. We also observed that using GE inserts minimized differences between ﬁnal
cell concentrations following growth under normal and microgravity. Similarly, Wilson et al. ,
did not observe any difference in ﬁnal cell concentration between spaceﬂight and normal
gravity when Salmonella was cultured in FPAs with GE inserts, as measured by FCM
[13,15,17]. While we observed that the use of GE inserts was advantageous for bacteria
grown in normal gravity, no additional increases were observed for spaceﬂight cultures when
the solid inserts were replaced with the GE inserts. This may be attributed to a lower oxygen
transfer rate in microgravity, as described previously for LSMMG [16]. Indeed, studies of P.
aeruginosa PAOl gene expression have indicated that growth in FPAs is likely
mieroaerophilie 0r anaerobic even with the GE inserts and that differences in oxygen
gradients within the FPAs likely eXist between normal gravity and spaceﬂight conditions
[17]. We have recently observed that the use of GE inserts also minimized differences in P.
aeruginosa PA14 bioﬁlm growth between normal and spaceﬂight conditions [24]. In that
case, we did see increases in bioﬁlm biomass in spaceﬂight samples with GE inserts.
However, the proximity of the bioﬁlm substrate to the GE inserts ensured that any additional
oxygen was delivered directly to the growing bioﬁlm cells. Overall, these ﬁndings highlight
the role that environmental conditions and nutrient availability have on modulating how
microbes respond to the spaceﬂight environment.

While motile bacteria have been predicted to be less affected by the indirect effects of gravity
on Earth, such as cell settling, due to their ability to self—propel [14], we did not observe any
difference between the ﬁnal cell densities of motile and non-motile P. aeruginosa. This is
likely due to the fact that even motile P. aeruginosa do not swim constantly. Indeed, bacterial
motility has been shown to vary during growth [46], where the proportion of cells actively
swimming decrease as bacteria approach stationary phase [47]. As such, the difference
between our results and earlier experiments with E. coli [9] may be attributed to differences
in the regulation of swimming motility between the two organisms under the conditions
tested. Together, this suggests that while a constantly swimming population of cells may
mitigate the role of gravity, the regulation of motility can lead even cells that are capable of
swimming motility to be affected by gravity and to exploit the advantages of the microgravity
environment.

Unlike P. aeruginosa PAOl cultured under LSMMG, P. aeruginosa PA14 cultured during
spaceﬂight did not form cellular aggregates in planktonie cultures. This observation is likely
due to differences in the extracellular polymeric substances (EPS) that are responsible for
cellular aggregation [48]. Production of EPS in P. aeruginosa is known to be modulated by
various environmental factors, including shear stress [49]. The difference between the
LSMMG results and our spaceﬂight results may be due to the fact that the spaceﬂight
environment has far lower shear than LSMMG [17]. It may also be due to differences in EPS
composition between P. aeruginosa PAOl and PA14, where P. aeruginosa PA14 has Pel as a
primary polysaccharide, P. aeruginosa PAOl has Psl [50]. Because similar aggregation has
been observed with Salmonella grown during spaceﬂight [13] and S. aureus grown in
LSMMG [43], further studies of how shear, nutrient availability and genetics affect this
behavior may provide additional insights into how different microbes respond to the
spaceﬂight environment.

"
"11","Conclusions

Our ﬁndings indicate that differences in P. aeruginosa ﬁnal cell densities observed between
spaceﬂight and normal gravity are due to an interplay between changes in mixing and
transport that occur under microgravity conditions and the availability of substrates essential
for growth. These results may improve our ability to predict how different microbes will
respond to microgravity and how combinations of environmental and genetic factors affect
important behaviors, such as growth and Virulence, both during spaceﬂight and on Earth.
Here, we have shown that the microgravity environment encountered during spaceﬂight
appears to allow cells to grow better with limited resources when compared to similar
conditions on Earth. Considering the majority of bacteria, including those that are found on
spacecrafts and space stations, live in nutrient-limited environments, this ﬁnding highlights
the need for ongoing studies of how these effects may affect crew health during long-term
spaceﬂight.

Methods

Bacterial strains and culture media

Pseudomonas aeruginosa PA14 [23] and its isogenic motility mutant, AmotABCD [40], were
used for the current experiment. All strains were grown overnight at 37°C with shaking at
225 rpm in nutrient broth (NB) (Difeo BD). To prepare inocula, cultures were washed and
resuspended in phosphate buffered saline (PBS) to a ﬁnal concentration of ~6 X 106 CFU/mL.
The modiﬁed artiﬁcial urine medium (mAUM) used in the present study is based on the
medium previously described by Brooks et al., [31]. To ensure reproducibility in media
composition, RPMI 1640 amino acid solution (50x; Sigma, cat #: R7131) and L-glutamine
solution (200 mM; Sigma, cat #: G7513) were substituted for peptone and yeast extract. The
concentration of calcium chloride dihydrate was lowered from 2.5 mM to 0.25 mM to
minimize precipitation during storage at 8°C. Sodium nitrate, 6 mM, was added to serve as a
terminal electron acceptor and enable some growth under oxygen limiting conditions. Higher
concentrations of sodium nitrate were avoided to minimize any effects on aerobic growth and
limit the accumulation of nitrite, which can inhibit cell growth. To test the effects of carbon
source, 2 mM citric acid was substituted by 2 mM glucose (mAUMg). To assess the role of
phosphate availability, we used either 5 mM or 50 mM phosphate, where mAUM and
mAUMg include 5 mM phosphate and mAUM-high Pi and mAUMg-high Pi contain 50 mM
phosphate. The pH of all media was adjusted to 7.0.

Spaceﬂight and ground control cultures

Spaceﬂight and ground control cultures of P. aeruginosa were prepared and grown in a ﬂuid
processing apparatus (FPA) as described previously [24]. T0 load the FPA, a 13-mm
diameter mixed cellulose ester membrane disc (Millipore) was ﬁrst attached to a solid or a
gas exchange (GE) insert with autoelavable double-sided tape (3 M). Next, 2.5 mL of media
and 0.5 mL of inoculum were sequentially loaded into two compartments separated by a
rubber stopper. Due to constraints imposed by the dimensions of the bevel, approximately 0.6
mL of air remained in the compartment containing the media after loading. A third
compartment, for FCM samples only, was ﬁlled with 2.4 mL of 9% w/V paraformaldehyde in
PBS. Three biological replicates were prepared for each experimental condition. Eight FPAs
were loaded into a single group activation pack (GAP), which enables simultaneous plunging

"
"12","0f the rubber stoppers in each FPA, and were incubated in a Commercial Generic
Bioprocessing Apparatus (CGBA) as described previously [30]. Cultures were grown
following the experiment timeline shown in Figure 1. Before shuttle launch, all FPAs were
loaded and stored at ambient temperature for at least 48 h to check for contamination.
Samples were subsequently stored at 8°C (L-1) until activation. Five days before shuttle
landing, the media and inoculum were combined and incubated at 37°C for 72 h (activation).
Two days before shuttle landing, the temperature was decreased to 8°C and the FCM samples
were ﬁxed with paraformaldehyde (termination). Samples were obtained approximately 6 h
after shuttle landing and processed immediately. Ground controls were conducted at Kennedy
Space Center in parallel with spaceﬂight samples. The attached membranes were separated
from the liquid phase, planktonie fractions. Characterization and analysis of bioﬁlm growth
on the membranes have been reported separately [24].
Plate counting
One mL of the planktonie fraction was sonicated in an ultrasonic bath (Branson 2510) for 8
min to disperse any clumps of cells. The planktonie fraction was serially diluted with PBS.
Samples were spot-plated on NB agar and incubated at 37°C for 18 h prior to counting.
Sample preparation and ﬂow cytometric analysis
Bacterial cells ﬁxed with paraformaldehyde were washed with PBS and stained with 4',6-
diamidin0-2-pheny1ind01e (DAPI; Life Technologies) for 2 h at room temperature according
to the manufacturer’s instructions. Stained samples were diluted to approximately 5 x 105 — 9
x 106 CFU/mL with PBS. Cell numbers were measured using a FACSAria ﬂow cytometer
(BD Biosciences) equipped with a 407 nm laser. To calculate the concentration of cells from
FCM recorded events, liquid counting beads (BD Biosciences) were used following the
manufacturer’s instruction. Brieﬂy, 50 ”L of the liquid counting beads was added to 1 mL of
each diluted sample. The beads were detected by FCM in a separate region that does not
overlap with the cells. The number of events in the cell region was recorded until one
thousand events in the bead region were detected. The concentration of cells in each sample
was calculated using the following equation.

Cone. of cells = WXWX dilution factor

# of events in bead region test volume

Effects of post-growth storage on Viable cell counts and FCM data
The experiments were performed using FPAs following the same timeline and temperature
proﬁle as described in Figure 1. FPAs were incubated at 37°C for 72 h. Samples were either
processed immediately or stored at 8°C for 48 h. To process samples, 1 mL of culture was
enumerated by plate counting and a second 1 mL fraction was ﬁxed with paraformaldehyde
and enumerated by FCM.
Light microscopy
For differential interference contrast (DIC) microscopy, P. aeruginosa stains ﬁxed with
paraformaldehyde after experimental termination. The ﬁxed P. aeruginosa stains were

"
"13","observed using Olympus IX-81 inverted microscope equipped with DIC optics, 60X/ 1.35 oil
Zeiss.

Statistical analysis and numerical interpretation

All data were represented as mean i standard deviation (SD) of three biological replicates.
Statistical comparison of the number of cells between normal gravity and spaceﬂight for each
different condition was conducted using a one-tailed Student’s t-test. When assessing
combinations of two factors (post-growth storage and the microgravity environment, or
phosphate concentration in media and microgravity) or three factors (motility, phosphate
concentration in media, and microgravity), the effects of each factor and their interaction
were assessed by two or three-way ANOVA with post-hoe Tukey tests using PASW
Statisties18 (SPSS 1110.). Statistical signiﬁcance was deﬁned as p < 0.05.
