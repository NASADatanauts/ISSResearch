Abstract The search for traces of extinct 0r extant life in extraterrestrial environments is one of
the main goals for astrobiologists; due to their ability to Withstand stress producing conditions,
extremophiles are perfect candidates for astrobiological studies. The BIOMEX project aims to
test the ability of biomolecules and cell components to preserve their stability under space and
Mars—like conditions, While at the same time investigating the survival capability of microor-
ganisms. The experiment has been launched into space and is being exposed on the EXPOSE-
R2 payload, outside of the International Space Station (188) over a time—span of 1.5 years.
Along With a number of other extremophilic microorganisms, the Antarctic cryptoendolithic
black fungus Cryomyces antarcticus CCFEE 515 has been included in the experiment. Before
launch, dried colonies grown on Lunar and Martian regolith analogues were exposed to
vacuum, irradiation and temperature cycles in ground based experiments (EVT1 and EVT2).
Cultural and molecular tests revealed that the fungus survived on rock analogues under space
and simulated Martian conditions, showing only slight ultra-structural and molecular damage.

Introduction
The question Whether extraterrestrial life eXists has always intrigued scientists. Extremophilic
and extreme—tolerant microorganisms have, as their natural niches, environments previously
thought to be incompatible With active life; for this reason they are perfect models for studying
the limits of habitability on Earth. The McMurdo Dry Valleys of Antarctica, Arctic regions,
permafrost soils and cold deserts, for instance, are considered to be good analogues of Mars
environments due to their permanently cold and dry conditions (Hansen et a1. 2007). Microbes
living there are pushed to the absolute limits of adaptability and represent a perfect tool for
astrobiological research (Finster et a1. 2007).

The resistance of these terrestrial extremophiles under both space simulation and LEO (Low
Earth Orbit) has been documented (Horneck et a1. 2010). Both ground based and space experiments
on the International Space Station ([88), i.e. the LIFE experiment on Expose-E (Rabbow et a1.
2012), showed that some organisms, such as spores of bacteria, meristernatic black fungi, and
lichens, are able to survive and reactivate their metabolism after space simulations or direct exposure
to space GDernets et a1. 2005; de la Torre et a1. 2007, de La Torre et a1. 2010; de Vera et a1. 2002,
2004; Horneck et a1. 1994; Olsson—Francis et a1. 2009; Onofri et a1. 2008, 2012; Raggio et a1. 2011;
Sancho et a1. 2007, 2008) and even simulated Martian conditions (Baque et a1. 2013; MeeBen et al.
2013a; M0e11er et a1. 2012; sanchez et a1. 2012).

This work is a part of BIOlogy and Mars EXperirnent (BIOMEX), exposed on the EXPOSE-
R2 payload (Rabbow et a1. 2015), Whose main goal is to detect signatures of extinct 0r extant life
on Mars, investigating the fate of selected extreme—tolerant organisms and the stability of
associated biomolecules, after exposure to actual space and simulated Mars conditions.
Investigations Will be based on sensitive and non-destructive approaches such as Infrared (Igisu
et a1. 2006, 2009) and Raman spectroscopies (Bettger et a1. 2012, 2013; de Vera et a1. 2012), using
for comparison an international Raman library Whose construction is in progress.

Another main objective of BIOMEX is to test survival in extra—terrestrial conditions of
selected extreme-to1erant/extrern0phi1ic lithobionts, such as bacteria, meristernatic black fungi
and lichens grown on Mars and Lunar regolith analogues.

Among the selected organisms, the cryptoendolithic black fungus Cryomyces antarcticus
CCFEE 515, from the McMurdo Dry Valleys in Antarctica, is an excellent eukaryotic model

due to its exceptional stress resistance and ability to grow inside the rock (Selbmann et a1.
2005). Its survival in dried conditions after 18 months of exposure to actual space outside of
the 188, as well as to simulated Mars conditions in space, which was recently demonstrated,
gave new insights to the Lithopanspermia theory (transfer of life between neighbor planets
within a meteorite) (Onofri et a1. 2012).

On July 24th 2014 the EXPOSE-R2 facility (Fig. 1): was launched onboard a Russian
Progress cargo spacecraft (Fig. 2) from the Baikonur Cosmodrome, Kazakhstan t0 the ISS and
mounted outside the ISS Zvezda module. The EXPOSE-R2 facility carried BIOMEX, along
with the Bioﬁlm Organisms Surﬁng Space (BOSS), Photochemistry 0n the Space Station
(PSS) and an experiment from the Russian Institute of Biomedical Problems (IBMP).

This work focuses on the preparatory ground—based EVTs (Experiment Veriﬁcation Tests)
which include space and Mattian simulations, performed on C. antarcticus in support of the
actual space exposure.

Results give clues in searching for life in future Mars exploration missions (de Vera et a1.
2012) in detecting putative biosignatures.

Material and Methods

Fungal Strain Preparation

Cryomyces antarcticus CCFEE 515 was isolated by R. Ocampo-Friedmann from sandstone
collected at Linnaeus Terrace (Southern Victoria Land) by H. Vishniac, in the Antarctic
expedition 1980—81.

For the EVT tests, cell suspensions were spread on MEA (malt extract agar: malt extract,
powdered 30 g/L; peptone 5 g/L; agar 15 g/L; Applichem, GmbH) in Petri dishes, mixed with
Antarctic sandstone (15 g/L), Lunar and Martian analogues (1 g/L), prepared to optimize
mineral/microorganisms interactions. Sandstone was the original substrate (OS) for the test
fungus, Lunar analogue (L) was constituted mainly of an01th0site (Mytrokhyn et a1. 2003) and
two speciﬁc Martian analogues were composed of sulfatic Mars regolith (S—MRS) and
phyllosilicatic Mars Regolith (P-MRS), simulating 1ate basic Mars and early acidic Mars
surface lithosphere composition, respective1y(B6ttger et a1. 2012). Mars analogue composition

Fig. 2 BIOMEX launch on July 24th 2014
was developed and produced by the Naturkundernuseurn Berlin, according to the data of Mars
research missions (Bibring et a1. 2005; Chevrier and Mathe 2007; Poulet et a1. 2005). Colonies
were grown at 15 0C for 3 months. Disks, cut to ﬁt within the wells of exposure carrier (12 mm
diameter) (Fig. 1b), were drilled under sterile conditions.

Untreated samples, prepared as above and stored in the dark at room temperature, were
used as controls in all the tests performed.

Tests Facilities and Exposure Conditions

Ground-based simulations (EVTs) were performed using the Planetary and Space
Simulation facilities (PSI) at the Institute of Aerospace Medicine (German
Aerospace Center, DLR, Kéln, Germany). Tests were performed in triplicate and
exposure conditions were as reported in Table 1.

Survival Tests

Cultivation Test

Survival of C. antarcticus was determined by its colony forming ability as percentages of CFU
(Colony Forming Units).

For the test, three of the treated colonies were suspended in 1 mL of physiological solution
(NaCl 0.9 %), and diluted to a ﬁnal concentration of 3000 cells/mL; 0.1 mL of the suspension
was spread on Petri dishes supplemented with MEA (5 replicates), incubated at 15 0C for
3 months and counted.

PMA Assay

The test was performed by adding the Propidiurn MonoAzide (PMA, Biotiurn, Hayward, CA)
at a ﬁnal concentration of 200 11M to 1—2 re-hydrated fungal colonies. PMA penetrates only

Following DNA extraction and puriﬁcation, quantitative PCR (Biorad CFX96 real time
PCR detection system) was used to quantify the number of fungal Internal Transcribed Spacer
(ITS) ribosomal DNA fragments present in both PMA treated and non-treated samples. Five
LLL ofpuriﬁed genomic DNA (0.1 ng/ml) were added to 12 LLL of PCR cocktail containing 1X
Power Sybr—Green PCR Master Mix (Applied Bios, Foster City, CA), as well as N891 forward
(5’-gtc cct gcc ctt tgt aca cac-3’) and ITSSl reverse (5’-acc ttg tta cga ctt tta ctt cct c-3’) primers,
each at 5 pmol ﬁnal concentration. Sterile water was added to reach the ﬁnal volume of 25 11L.

These primers amplify a 203 bp product spanning the ISS/ITSI region of rRNA encoding
genes.

A standard Q-PCR cycling protocol, consisting of a denaturation step at 95 0C for 2 min,
followed by 35 cycles of denaturing at 95 0C for 30 s, annealing at 55 0C for 30 s, and
elongation at 72 0C for 30 s, was performed. Fluorescence measurements were recorded at the
end of each annealing step. After forty cycles, a melt curve analysis was performed by
recording changes in ﬂuorescence as a function of raising the temperature from 60 to 90 0C
in 0.5 0C per increments. All tests were performed in triplicate.

Statistical Analyses
For multiple data points, the calculation of the mean and standard deviations was performed.
Statistical analyses were performed by one-way analysis of variance (Anova) and pair wise
multiple comparison procedure (Tukey test), carried out using the statistical software
SigmaStat 2.0 (Jandel, USA).
DNA Extraction and PCR Analyses
DNA was extracted from rehydrated colonies, using Nucleospin Plant kit (Macherey-
Nagel, Diiren, Germany) following the protocol optimized for fungi.

ITS and LSU ampliﬁcations were performed using BioMiX (BioLine GmbH, Luckenwalde,
Germany) adding 5 pmol of each primer and 20 ng of template DNA at ﬁnal volume of 25 LLL.
The ampliﬁcation was carried out using MyCycler Thermal Cycler (Bio—Rad Laboratories
GmbH, Munich, Germany) equipped with a heated lid.

The rDNA regions were ampliﬁed as follows: for the ITS region the ﬁrst denaturation step
at 95 0C for 2 min was followed by denaturation at 95 0C for 30 s, annealing at 55 0C for 30 s,
extension at 72 0C for 30 s and for the LSU region the ﬁrst denaturation step at 95 0C for 3 min
was followed by denaturation at 95 0C for 45 s, annealing at 52 0C for 30 s, extension at 72 0C
for 3 min. The last three steps were repeated 35 times, with a last extension 72 0C for 5 min for
ITS and 7 min for LSU. Primers ITSS, ITS4 (White et al. 1990), LR5 and LR7 (Vilgalys and
Hester 1990) were employed to amplify ITS and LSU rDNA portions, respectively.
Random Amplification of Polymorphic DNA (RAPD) Assay
RAPD was performed using BioMiX (BioLine GmbH, Luckenwalde, Germany) adding
5 pmol of the primer and 1 ng of template DNA at ﬁnal volume of 25 LLL. The
primer used for RAPD was GGA7 (GGA GGA GGA GGA GGA GGA GGA) (Kong
et al. 2000). The conditions for amplification were: ﬁrst denaturation step at 94 0C for
2 min followed by denaturation at 94 0C for 20 s, annealing at 49 0C for 60 s,
extension at 72 0C for 20 s. The last three steps were repeated 40 times, with a last
extension at 72 0C for 6 min.

Transmission Electron Microscopy (TEM)

Controls and UV—irradiated colonies were treated with 5 % glutaraldehyde/cacodylate
sucrose buffer 0.1 M (pH 7.2) for 12 h at 4 0C, washed three times in the same
buffer for 1 h each at 4 OC and fixed with 1 % OsO4 + 0.15 % ruthenium red in
0.1 M cacodylate buffer (pH 7.2) for 3 h at 4 oC. Samples were washed in distilled
water (2 times for 30 min at 4 0C), treated with 1 % uranyl acetate in distilled water
for 1 h at 4 oC and washed in distilled water (2 times, 30 min at 4 oC). Samples were
then dehydrated in ethanol solutions: 30 %, 50 %, 70 % (15 min each, at room
temperature) and 100 % EtOH (1 h at room temperature), critical point dried and
inﬁltrated in ethanol 100 %: LR White series with accelerator, in rotator, at 4 oC (2:1
for 3 h; 1:1 for 3 h, 1:2 overnight) and embedded in pure resin for 1 day and
overnight; as ﬁnal step, samples were included in pure resin in gelatinous capsule for
2 days at 48—52 0C.

Results
Cultural Tests
C. antarcticus retained the colony-forming ability after both EVTl and EVT2 treatments. In
EVTl (Fig. 3) the fungus showed a similar trend of survival on all the substrates tested: in
general, survival decreased with increased UV—irradiation doses. Yet, colonies formed even at
the highest dose, 10.000 J/mz, where percentage of survival was 5 %, 18 %, 38 % and 46 % in
Lunar, Original Substrate, P-MRS and S—MRS analogues, respectively. The fungus, grown on
MaItian analogues, was able to survive exposure to the Martian atmosphere with no signiﬁcant
decrement 0n S—MRS with respect the control and almost 60 % of survival 0n P-MRS.
Surprisingly, lower Vitality was observed, for all substrates tested, at —25 0C than at 60 0C.
In the EVT2 treatments (Fig. 4), a progressive increase of mOItality was observed with
increasing of UV—irradiation doses, but 48 %, 38 % and 72 % of germination was recorded
even at highest doses for colonies grown on Original Substrate, S-MRS and P-MRS, respec-
tively. Colony-forming ability was maintained in most cases after EVT2 treatments; the only
exceptions was the highest irradiation in Lunar sample.

Vitality, speciﬁcally, the integrity of the plasma membrane, was also tested through PMA assay
on control and EVT2 samples treated with medium and maximum irradiation doses for each
substrate (Fig. 5). This test gave a higher percentage of possible survival (measured as cells with
intact membrane) compared to the results ﬁom the cultural test, even at the highest dose; for
instance, n0 colonies were recorded under Lunar conditions but 35 % was observed with PMA
assay. No signiﬁcant differences between treated samples and control were obtained on P-MRS.
DNA Damage
The integrity of genomic DNA in treated samples was tested by assessing its ability to serve as
a PCR template both after EVT1 and EVT2 treatments.

All the EVT2 samples were analyzed, while for EVTl, 0n the basis of colony forming
results, only samples exposed at maximum treatments were chosen: Temperature Cycles,
Vacuum 7 h, Martian atmosphere 7d, maximum dose of UV (254 nm) irradiation at 104J/
m2. Ampliﬁcations worked out for all the gene-lengths in EVT1 (Fig. 6a, b and c) and
EVT2 (Fig. 7a, b and c) exposed samples. A reduced intensity of PCR bands was
evident in panel c, with the largest gene length, in Lunar EVT1 samples exposed to
10,000 J/m2 (Fig. 60, Lane L 104) and for colonies grown on S-MRS at the highest
dose of UV (>200 11m) irradiation in EVT2.

Although there was an overall decrease in band intensity, mainly for the highest molecular
weight (MW) bands (about 2200 bp) the RAPD proﬁles were well preserved in all samples

Control cells maintained mostly an intact cell membrane and a well-organized and
deﬁned cytoplasm after dehydration (Figs. 8a, 0, e, g, i). By contrast, the majority of
cells in the irradiated samples showed extended damage with irregular shapes, dam-
aged cell walls, discontinuous cell membranes and a compromised organization of the
cytoplasm (Fig. 8b, (1, f, h, j).
Discussion
Ground-based simulations, EVTl and EVT2, performed in the frame of the BIOMEX
experiment currently on-board the EXPOSE-R2 platform ﬁxed outside the 188, were prelim-
inary experiments to validate samples for the space mission. One of the aims of the project was
to study dried cells of C. antarcticus, grown on lunar regolith analogue rocks and two Mars
regolith analogue mixtures, to test survival as well as DNA and ultra—structural damage.
Although a reduced survival was observed after exposure to the most stressing parameters, C.
antarcﬂcus retained some colony forming ability after UV irradiation as well as after simulated
treatment with other outer space stressors. These results were conﬁrmed by TEM observations
showing that, in addition to cells showing ultrastructural damage after the highest irradiation dose, a

number of cells were still in good condition (not shown), which agrees with the survival rate
recorded in the colony fonning assays. The main damaging factors of the EVTs were UV irradiation
and temperature cycles. C. antarcticus survival was higher after +60 0C than after —25 oC treatment.
The surprising ability of this psychrophilic fungus to tolerate very high temperatures was previously
observed, when it was found to retain 100 % survival after exposure to 1 h at 90 oC (Onofri et al.
2008). Survival was high even under simulated Mars atmosphere and vacuum since more than 50 %
of colonies developed in all cases. If survival was comparable in the irradiated samples on Martian
analogues, values were different on the two substrata when the fungus was exposed to Martian
atmosphere: no signiﬁcant decrement was recorded on S—MRS with respect the control whereas here
was less than 60 % of survival for P-MRS (F ig. 3). This apparently incongruent result is difﬁcult to
explain and requires additional investigations.

Most samples showed a higher percentage of apparent survival in PMA assays as compared
to colony forming tests. This apparent inconsistency may be due to the coincidental preserva-
tion of cell membrane integrity in cells that have lost the ability to multiply, preventing PMA to
penetrate and react with DNA; this could have led to an overestimation of Vitality in some
cases, i.e. Lunar sample. The membrane may be less susceptible to damage than DNA or the
DNA replication enzymes under some of these conditions. Similar results were reported by
Bryan et al. (2015) who also obtained higher values with the indirect XTT assay method with
respect the clonogenic approach for testing survival for irradiated fungal cells of Cryptococcus
neoformans. Data obtained in Lunar sample (8 X 105 kJ/mz), where survival was 35 % in PMA
assay compared to zero in cultural test, may be due to the loss of the ability to multiply in some
cells where UV treatment caused extensive molecular damage, since UV targets more specif-
ically the DNA rather than the membrane.

It is worth noting that the highest survival, both from cultural analysis and PMA assay, was
obtained for C. antarcticus grown on P-MRS; the same fate was recently reported for the
mycobiont 0f Buellia frigida suggesting a protective role of the substratum (MeeBen et al.
2015). The same authors observed that the highest Viability was obtained when the lichen was
exposed on the original rock substratum. Differently, in the frame of BIOMEX experiment,
Baque et al. (2014) reported a higher survival of the cyanobacterium Chroococcidiopsis when
mixed with S—MRS regolith. This contrasting results led us to conclude that a possible
protective role of the analogues is difﬁcult to be sustained for now and needs to be further
studied. Our results clearly demonstrate the high resistance of C. antarcticus to all EVT
treatments, including exposure to vacuum, simulated Mars atmosphere, and different doses
of monochromatic (254 nm) and polychromatic (>200 nm) UV radiation.

Further studies on C. antarcﬂcus in the last ground tests (Scientiﬁc Veriﬁcation Test, SVT) are still
in progress and will clarify the real role of substrates in the protection; it was suggested that survival in
space could beneﬁt from the shielding provided by melanin. Melanin is a biological macromolecule
mainly known for its protective role against UV, extreme temperatures, desiccation and osmotic stress
(Sterﬂinger 2006; Plemenitas et al. 2008). The high tolerance to UV—B exposure of single cells of
black fungi has been reported by Onofri et al. (2007). It is known that melanin strongly absorbs UVB,
UVA, and PAR, thereby protecting fungi and lichens against those stressors (Nybakken et al. 2004;
MeeBen et al. 2013b). Moreover, it was observed that melanized fungal spores, in addition to
resistance to UV radiation, even resist y—ray and X—ray treatment better than melanin-deﬁcient ones
(Bell and Wheeler 1986) suggesting a role for this pigment in radioprotection of fungi (Henson et al.
1999; Dadachova et al. 2007). In this study, the presence of either Martian and Lunar analogues did
not affect molecular analyses since genomic DNA was successfully extracted and ampliﬁed even
from samples that had lost the ability to form colonies. In agreement with what is reported in the

literature, PCR band intensity decreased mainly in the highest molecular weight fragments in single-
gene PCR (Atienzar et al. 2002). However, most of the amplicons were still obtained even at highest
doses of UV—irradiation and RAPD proﬁles were well preserved in all samples. This surprisingly high
DNA resistance to UV—irradiation, if protected by screening pigments, the outer cell envelop or a dust
layer, suggests DNA as a possible biosignature candidate in future exploration missions (Lyon et al.
2010). Of course its resistance to UV—radiation needs to be proved over much longer timescales.

It is worth noting that ancient DNA was actually recovered on Earth from samples between 400
thousand and 1.5 million years old (Sankaranarayanan et al. 2014); it was also postulated that present
Mars conditions (in terms of dryness and low temperatures) may even preserve ancient DNA much
better than Earth conditions (Sephton 2010) with a theoretical preservation of a 100 bp fragment of
DNA along a timescale of 3.4 X 109 years at —50 oC and 3 X 1021 years at —1 10 0C at the Martian
polar ice caps (WillersleV et al. 2004). Moreover, some speciﬁc conditions could improve the long-
term preservation of ancient DNA in halite crystals, permafrost, amber depositions and marine
sediments (Panieri et al. 2010). Of course, some other damaging factors, such as ionizing radiation
(Hassler et al. 2014) and oxidative environments (Y en et al. 2000; Hecht et al. 2009) on Mars, must
be taken into consideration; but our simulation experiments suggest that we may have a good chance
to reveal the presence of DNA, in present, in putative extraterrestrial samples, by using some low-
speciﬁcity based approach such as random primers (as for RAPD) or non—speciﬁc staining such as
orange acridine or non—toxic ones such as gel red and sytox green.

Conclusion
C. antarcticus is an astonishingly resistant fungus, able to withstand even long term exposure to
actual Space conditions (Onofri et al. 2012); the present study proved that the fungus survives
space simulated stressors even when grown on extraterrestrial rock analogues. The awareness that
a terrestrial microbe may survive extraterrestrial conditions is an important clue in searching for
life on other planets, above all on Mars. Many efforts are now devoted to the deﬁnition of proper
biosignatures to detect whether life was ever present in an extraterrestrial sample from a putatively
habitable region. Our results show that genomic DNA can be successfully extracted even in the
presence of Martian or Lunar analogues; the ease of isolation and detection are key characteristics
for a suitable biosignature, and optimizing the extraction is an important challenge in detecting
biomarkers (Aerts et al. 2014). PCR was also successful and ampliﬁcations were obtained for
most of the genes even at a length of up to 2000 bp; this was regardless of the treatments, revealing
a high DNA persistence. Further analyses on samples treated in more stressing ground based
experiments (SVT) or exposed to actual space conditions in the frame of the BIOMEX experi-
ment, will provide further information on the detectability of this molecule and its suitability as
biomarker in future exploration missions. Studies are in progress to deﬁne additional biomole-
cules to be used as good biomarkers using non—destructive approaches as Raman and Infrared
spectroscopies, according to the instruments available on ExoMars.
