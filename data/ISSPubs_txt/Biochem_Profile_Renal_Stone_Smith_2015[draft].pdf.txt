"3","ABSTRACT
Bone loss and renal stone risk are longstanding concerns for astronauts. Bone resorption brought
on by spaceﬂight elevates urinary calcium and the risk of renal stone formation. Loss of bone
calcium leads to concerns about fracture risk and increased long-term risk of osteoporosis. Bone
metabolism involves many factors and is interconnected with muscle metabolism and diet. We
report here bone biochemistry and renal stone risk data from astronauts on 4- to 6-month
International Space Station missions. All had access to a type of resistive exercise
countermeasure hardware, either the Advanced Resistance Exercise Device (ARED) or the
interim resistance exercise device (iRED). A subset of the ARED group also tested the
bisphosphonate alendronate as a potential anti-resorptive countermeasure (Bis+ARED). While
some of the basic bone marker data have been published, we provide here a more comprehensive
evaluation of bone biochemistry with a larger group of astronauts. Regardless of exercise, the
risk of renal stone formation increased during spaceﬂight. A key factor in this increase was urine
volume, which was lower during ﬂight in all groups at all time points. Thus, the easiest way to
mitigate renal stone risk is to increase ﬂuid consumption. ARED use increased bone formation
without changing bone resorption, and mitigated a drop in parathyroid hormone in iRED
astronauts. Solerostin, an osteocyte-derived negative regulator of bone formation, increased 10-
15% in both groups of astronauts who used the ARED (p<0.06). IGF-l, which regulates bone
growth and formation, increased during ﬂight in all 3 groups (p<0.001). Our results are
consistent with the growing body of literature showing that the hyper-resorptive state of bone
that is brought on by spaceﬂight can be countered pharmacologically or mitigated through an
exercise-induoed increase in bone formation, with nutritional support. Key questions remain
about the effect of exercise-induoed alterations in bone metabolism on bone strength and fracture
risk.

"4","Introduction

The effects of spaceﬂight on human physiology range from adaptive (e.g., reduced blood
volume) to pathological (e.g., risks associated With radiation exposure, increased incidence of
cataracts and other ophthalmic changes). Extensive efforts have been made to understand these
changes and to mitigate or counteract them When possible, engaging cell and animal models,
ground-analo g studies, and human spaceﬂight research. Bone loss has long been a concern for
astronaut health, as exposure to microgravity leads to increased bone resorption, shedding of
bone mineral, increased kidney stone risk, and concerns about fracture risk and premature
osteoporosis.[1, 2]

More than a half—oentury of research on disuse- and weightlessness-induoed bone loss has
identiﬁed increased bone resorption as a key factor in this loss, With secondary effects on
parathyroid hormone, Vitamin D and calcium metabolism, and associated increased renal stone
risk.[1, 2] Proposed countermeasures have included exercise, pharmaceutical agents, and
nutritional interventions, among other physical countermeasures (e.g., artificial
gravity/oentrifugation, Vibration). Recent data from the International Space Station (188)
document that male and female astronauts Who had good nutritional status (e.g., adequate energy
intake and maintenance of body mass, good Vitamin D status) and engaged in heavy resistive
exercise were able to maintain bone mineral density on average at preﬂight levels.[3, 4] A recent
study on 188 of the bisphosphonate alendronate also showed promise,[5] but this particular
pharmaceutical measure is primarily proposed as an alternative for missions Where exercise
devices are not available (e.g., exploration-olass missions With constraints on launch mass) or
can’t be used due to other factors (e.g., equipment anomalies).

Exercise and nutrition can attenuate the decline in bone mineral density during
spaceﬂight not because they change bone resorption, but rather because exercise induces an
increase in bone formation.[1, 3, 4] The same phenomenon was observed in bed rest studies
using heavy resistance exercise.[6] Key questions remain as to Whether the increased bone
metabolic activity alters bone architecture as well as bone strength calculations based on bone

"5","density. Studies to evaluate these residual questions are underway, With pre- and postﬂight QCT
and ﬁnite element modeling methodology. Furthermore, studies to optimize exercise and
nutritional support for additional countermeasure beneﬁts are also ongoing. While pre- and
postﬂight densitometry studies are clearly required, the ability to collect blood and urine samples
during ﬂight allows the dynamics of bone and calcium metabolism to be evaluated during ﬂight.

Calcium loss resulting from altered bone metabolism, speciﬁcally increased resorption,
is associated With increased risk of renal stones during ﬂight.[7-9] Although this risk is in large
part related to excretion of urine that has higher concentrations of calcium,[10] many factors
affect renal stone risk, including diet, hydration status, and environment. The nature of calcium
homeostasis is such that daily consumption and excretion of substantial amounts of calcium is
affected by many factors that are Virtually impossible to isolate. Modifying other factors, urine
volume being a critical one, is key in reducing the urinary supersaturation that can lead to renal
stone f0rmati0n.[11] Pharmacological countermeasures have been studied and have proven
successful, including potassium citrate during ﬂight[7] and potassium magnesium citrate during
bed rest,[12] but these do not mitigate risks of all types of stones, and as With any
pharmacological agent, are not Without potential side effects.

We report here bone biochemistry and renal stone risk data from 23 astronauts 0n 4- t0 6-
month 188 missions, including data from those using different types of resistive exercise
countermeasures, and from a subset of erewmembers testing the bisphosphonate alendronate as a
potential anti-resorptive countermeasure.[5] While some of the basic bone marker data have
been published, we provide here a more comprehensive evaluation of bone biochemistry With a
larger group of astronauts. The data reported herein document the regulation of calcium
homeostasis, bone metabolism, and renal stone risk during 4- t0 6-month space missions, and
reveal effects of exercise and pharmacologic countermeasures.

"6","Methods
Study design and participants

The studies described herein were part of a larger Nutritional Status Assessment proj eot
conducted on the International Space Station. Other aspects of the study have been published,[1,
3-5, 13, 14] but the data reported here have not been previously reported on this group of
individuals. Most notably, we now have a larger cohort, and we report here for the ﬁrst time data
for additional bone regulatory markers and urine markers related to the risk of developing renal
stones. The renal stone data reported here have not been published, although an earlier report
appeared on the efﬁcacy of potassium citrate as a renal stone countermeasure in a different
astronaut oohort.[7] The present study was reviewed and approved by the NASA J ohnson Space
Center Institutional Review Board, and written informed consent was obtained from all subj eots.

Subjects (n = 23) were astronauts on 188 Expeditions 14—35 (missions ﬂown between
2006 and 2013). Exercise equipment on 188 has been described in detail elsewhere,[3, 15-17]
including the updated exercise equipment ﬂown to 188 in 2008. The earlier resistance exercise
device was known as the interim resistance exercise device (iRED), and provided a load of up to
300 pounds of resistive force. The newer resistive exercise device, known as the Advanced
Resistance Exercise Device (ARED), provides a load of up to 600 pounds of resistive foree.[3]
In addition to resistance exercise, all orewmembers had access to treadmill and cycle ergometer
exercise devices.

Of the 23 participating astronauts, 7 (5 men and 2 women) had access to the iRED, and
16 had access to the ARED. Of the 16 who used the ARED, 7 (6 men and 1 woman) astronauts
took 70 mg alendronate weekly during their mission, as described previously,[5] while 9 (7 men
and 2 women) did not take the bisphosphonate. Thus, the 3 groups reported here are designated
“iRED,” “ARED,” and “Bis+ARED.” Our previous publication comparing astronauts using the
iRED and ARED[3, 4] had 8 iRED orewmembers. We excluded one subj eot for the current
analysis because that orewmember’s mission duration was very short (48 days). The outcomes
were not affected by this change. We previously reported bone densitometry and postﬂight bone
biochemistry data for men and women,[4] documenting that despite baseline differences between

5

"
"7","men and women, there was generally no difference in their response to space ﬂight. Thus, we
have combined the data here, given that the statistical analysis is of repeated measures and thus
examines individual differences from preﬂight values.

Mean (iSD) ﬂight duration was 173 i 39 d, 148 i 48 d, and 165 i 15 d for the iRED,
ARED, and Bis+ARED groups, respectively. The mean age (iSD) of orewmembers was 44 i 4,
49 i 3, and 49 i 4 y for the iRED, ARED, and Bis+ARED groups, respectively.

All but one of the female astronauts were believed to have been premenopausal at the
time of their mission; however, we do not have data pertaining to menstrual cycle regularity
and/or surgical status for the others. Additionally, most female astronauts suppress menstrual
cycles pharmacologically during ﬂight.

Astronauts had access to the standard spaceﬂight food system,[18, 19] and in addition
were provided with Vitamin D supplements (800 IU/d). Supplement lots were analyzed for
actual content before ﬂight to verify content.

Sample collection and processing

Blood and urine samples were collected before and during missions to the ISS. Blood
samples and two consecutive 24-h urine samples were collected about 180 and 45 days before
launch. All blood samples were collected soon after waking, and at least 8 h after food intake or
exercise. Because some biochemical testing was performed in real time in support of NASA
medical requirements, an additional blood sample and a 24-h urine sample were collected before
ﬂight. This was called the L-10 sample, but in reality it was often collected closer to L-45 days
for logistical reasons. The L-10 blood samples were processed in the same manner as in-ﬂight
samples; that is, blood tubes were ﬁlled, allowed to clot, centrifuged, and frozen at -80°C. These
samples were processed after ﬂight, alongside the in-ﬂight samples returned from 188, and thus
they provide a batch analysis and storage time control for the ﬂight samples. For biochemical
tests that were not part of medical testing, samples were aliquoted into smaller amounts before
they were frozen, to avoid repeated freeze/thaw cycles. These were also analyzed after ﬂight in
the same batches as the ﬂight returned samples.

6

"
"8","During ﬂight, erewmembers collected up to ﬁve blood and 24-h urine collections at about
ﬂight day 15 (designated FD15), FD30, FD60, FD120, and FD180. Because ﬂight durations
varied, not all crews had ﬁve in-ﬂight sessions (exact 11 is reported in tables). Blood samples
were collected using standard phlebotomy techniques, as described previously.[3, 4, 13, 14]
After centrifugation, tubes were frozen at —96°C until they were returned to Earth (within 6 to 12
months) aboard the Space Shuttle or a SpaeeX commercial cargo vehicle. The in-ﬂight samples
were transported from the landing site to Houston, where they were stored in a —80°C freezer
until they were analyzed.

Urine collected before ﬂight was collected into single-VOid urine containers (Cole-
Parmer, Niles, IL, USA). Samples were stored in coolers with ice packs 0r refrigerated until they
were processed, within 24 h of collection. In-ﬂight urine voids were collected into urine
collection devices containing 1 mL of a LiCl solution as a volume marker. These samples were
processed as described previously.[4, 13, 14, 20, 21]

Biochemical analyses

Blood and urine samples were analyzed for indices of bone and calcium metabolism, and
associated biochemistry. Serum bone-speeiﬁe alkaline phosphatase (BSAP, 7.8% between-assay
coefﬁcient of variation, CV, 4.5% within-assay CV) and osteoealcin (5.6%, 5.7% CV), served as
classical markers of bone formation, and selerostin (14.5%, 9.6% CVs) as a negative regulator of
osteoblasts. All of these were evaluated using commercially available kits.[4, 21-23] Total
alkaline phosphatase (2.6%, 0.9% CV) was determined enzymatically using an Olympus AU480
analyzer (Beckman Coulter, 1110., Brea, CA). Vitamin D metabolites (1,25 -dihydr0xyvitamin D,
15.2%, 7.5% CV, and 25 -hydr0xyVitamin D, 13.3%, 4.8% CV) were determined by
radioimmunoassay (DiaSorin, Inc, Stillwater, MN), as described previously. [4, 21-27]
Osteoprotegerin (OPG; 16.0%, 13.0% CV) and receptor activator of nuclear factor kappa-B
ligand (RANKL, 11.3%, 4.5% CV) were determined by ELISA (BioVendor, Asheville, NC) and
radioimmunoassay (Alpeo, Salem, NH; 5% CV), respectively. Serum selerostin was measured
by ELISA (Alpco, Salem, NH; 14.5%, 9.6% CV)

7

"
"9","Serum intact parathyroid hormone (PTH) was measured using radioimmunoassay
techniques. Changes in manufacturing required changing the kit used for PTH assays. Some
preﬂight PTH measurements for 5 subj eets were made with the kit from Nichols (Nichols
Institute Diagnostics, San Juan Capistrano, CA), and those data points were excluded from the
analyses. For two subj ects, blood samples from all time points were analyzed using the Nichols
kit, and those were included in the statistical analyses. One female iRED subj eet was completely
excluded from PTH analyses and graphs because all of the subj ect’s preﬂight and in-ﬂight
samples had been analyzed using two different kits. The remaining samples were analyzed using
an immunoradiometric assay (Scantibodies 1110., Santee, CA; 4.0%, 2.4% CV).

Serum insulin-like growth faetor-l (IGF-l) was measured using a radioimmunoassay,
and similar to PTH, changes in manufacturing required changing the kit used for the IGF-l
assay. Most samples were analyzed with the DSL kit (Diagnostics Systems Laboratories,
Webster, TX); however, 3 ARED and 3 Bis + ARED samples were analyzed using the Alpco
RIA (Alpeo, Salem, NH, 7.2%, 5.4% CV).

Several biomarkers of collagen degradation were analyzed, including N—telopeptide
(NTX, 8.9%. 5.6% CV), C—telopeptide (CTX, 13.5%, 13.7% CV), pyridinium erosslinks (PYD,
9.5%, 6.0% CV), deoxypyridinoline (DPD, 11.8%, 5.2% CV), and helical peptide (HP, 15.5%,
7.5% CV). All were analyzed using commercially available kits, as described previously.[22-24]
Serum total calcium (3.0%, 2.5% CV) and urinary calcium (2.5%, 1.9% CV) were determined by
atomic absorption spectrophotometry.[21-23] Urinary and serum creatinine (5.2%, 1.3% CV)
was analyzed using a colorimetric assay with a clinical analyzer (Ace Alera, Alfa Wassermann,
West Caldwell, NJ). Urie acid (0.95% CV) was measured by colorimetric assay on the Olympus
AU480 auto analyzer. Sodium (0.47% CV), and phosphorus (3.5% CV) were also measured by
ion-seleetive assay on the Olympus AU480. Citrate (1 .9% CV), sulfate (1.8% CV), and oxalate
(7.0% CV) were measured separately using a DioneX ICS-3 000 dual-column ion ehromatograph.
The pH of urine samples was measured with a potentiometrie Thermo Electron Corp. Orion 3-
Star pH meter.

"
"10","Renal stone risk and supersaturation calculations were done using previously documented
teohniques.[28, 29] Renal stone data are not reported for the Bis+ARED group, as those data are
expected to be published elsewhere by the Bisphosphonate experiment team.

Statistical analyses

A repeated-measures two-way ANOVA was performed on spaceﬂight data. When
overall significant differences were detected, a post hoe Bonferroni ttest was performed to
establish differences from preﬂight values or within treatments. Statistical analyses were
performed using SigmaPlot 12.0 (Systat Software, Inc., San J ose, CA). Log transformation had
to be used to normalize the data for some measures (2SOHD, osteooaloin, PTH, 1,25(OH)2D3,
urinary calcium, HP, PYD, and NTX). In these cases the log-transformed data were analyzed;
however, raw data are presented in the tables. Serum calcium and solerostin could not be
normalized, and the raw data for these variables were analyzed. p values < 0.05 were considered
statistically significant.

Results

By FD 120, bone formation was signiﬁcantly higher in ARED orewmembers than it was
before ﬂight, whether it was assessed by BSAP, total alkaline phosphatase, and/or osteooaloin
circulating concentrations. Crewmembers with access to the iRED tended to have higher
concentrations of these markers during ﬂight, but the difference between preﬂight and in-ﬂight
means only reached statistical signiﬁcance at FD180. There were no changes in any of these
formation markers in the Bis+ARED group (group X time interaction, p<0.001, Table 1). When
expressed as percentage change from before ﬂight, BSAP increased almost 60% by FD180 in the
ARED group and about 25% in the iRED group, but it was about 11% lower than preﬂight levels
in Bis+ARED subj eots (Figure 1).

9

"
"11","In the iRED subj eots, serum PTH concentrations decreased at all in-ﬂight time points
compared to before ﬂight (Table 1). Although PTH was decreased in ARED subj eots at the ﬁrst
3 in-ﬂight time points, it was not different from preﬂight values at the FD120 and FD180 time
points (group X time interaction, p<0.001) (Table 1; percentage change data are shown in Figure
2).

There was a significant effect of time (p<0.01) on serum ZSOHD and 1,25(OH)2D3
concentrations (Table 1). Vitamin D stores, reﬂected by serum 25 OHD, tended to be higher
during ﬂight than before ﬂight, although no specific statistical differences were identiﬁed by the
post hoe analysis. Furthermore, the average ZSOHD concentrations were well above Institute of
Medicine limits[30] for Vitamin D sufﬁciency (>50 nmol/L), and averages were close to or above
what many consider optimal Vitamin D concentrations (>75 nmol/L). The active form of Vitamin
D, 1,25(OH)2D3, was lower during ﬂight at certain time points (and tended to be lower at others)
(Table 1). Serum calcium was signiﬁcantly lower in Bis+ARED subj eots than in other groups of
subj eots before and throughout the ﬂight (p<0.05) (Table 1).

No statistically signiﬁcant changes were observed in solerostin during ﬂight, although in
general serum solerostin concentrations tended (p<0.06) to be increased about 15% above
preﬂight values (Table 1; percentage change data are shown in Figure 3). The iRED data are
somewhat confounded by large variability caused by two individuals with very large responses at
different time points. There were no obvious differences in any other data for these two
individuals, including bone densitometry changes. There was a signiﬁcant increase in the
RANKL/OPG ratio at ﬂight day 15 for all groups (Table 1).

Bone resorption (assessed with NTX, CTX, or HP) increased in ARED and iRED groups,
but was largely unchanged in Bis+ARED orewmembers (Table 2). DPD and PYD excretion was
increased in all 3 groups during ﬂight. Crosslink data expressed per millimole of creatinine
excretion showed trends identical to those of 24-h excretion data (Supplemental Table 1).

Renal stone risk proﬁle constituents are shown in Table 3. Urine volume was
signiﬁcantly lower in both groups during ﬂight. Relative supersaturation risks for brushite,
calcium oxalate, sodium urate, and uric acid were all signiﬁcantly elevated during spaceﬂight,

10

"
"12","but there was no effect of exercise group. StruVite supersaturation risk was not affected by
spaceﬂight or group. At all in-ﬂight time points, brushite and calcium oxalate relative
supersaturation were higher than they were before ﬂight for both exercise groups, and on average
all supersaturation risks during ﬂight were higher than for the general population. For urine
constituents that affect renal stone risk, only calcium, oxalate, and urine volume had signiﬁcant
differences by group or time. Urinary calcium excretion was generally greater during ﬂight for
both ARED and iRED groups, returning toward preﬂight values after FD120 (Table 3).

IGF-l concentrations were greater in all groups throughout spaceﬂight (time effect,
p<0.001) than they were before ﬂight (Table 4). Urinary creatinine was higher during ﬂight than
before ﬂight, as was creatinine clearance (Table 4), but there were no group differences. Serum
creatinine was unchanged during ﬂight and by treatment group.

Discussion

During spaceﬂight, bone mineral is released secondary to increased bone resorption.[1-3,
21] While resistive exercise and good nutritional status attenuate the decrements of bone mineral
density after ﬂight,[3, 4] this is accomplished through increased bone formation, and not through
a mitigation of the increased bone resorption. Pharmacological agents like bisphosphonates
suppress resorption by reducing osteoclast activity and number, but a coupled reduction in
osteoblast activity and numbers may also account for the attenuated bone formation response to
resistive exercise observed in the bisphosphonate-treated group. Thus, key questions remain
about the structure and quality of astronauts’ bones after ﬂight, how they are inﬂuenced by in-
ﬂight countermeasures used during ﬂight, and the resulting impact on skeletal integrity.

The risk of renal stone formation was increased during spaceﬂight, regardless of exercise.
A key factor in this increase was urine volume, which was lower during ﬂight at all time points
(Table 3). Some of the reduced urine volume may not have been physiological; that is,
orewmembers often report restricting ﬂuid intake on days when urine collections are scheduled,
given time and other issues related to the process. Nonetheless, ﬂuid intakes are usually lower
during spaceﬂight in part for the same reasons, that more time and effort are required to maintain

11

"
"13","intake in space. Additionally, the ISS cabin atmosphere has much lower humidity than Houston,
where the astronauts work, train, and live before their missions, and thus insensible water loss is
likely greater during ﬂight. The lower urine volume and higher calcium excretion rate leads to a
much higher concentration of calcium in the urine during ﬂight than before ﬂight, which was
documented to have caused precipitation and failure of the urine processing system on 188 in
2009.[10] Thus, dietary and metabolic factors will increase renal stone risk, and while the
countermeasure potassium citrate has been shown to reduce renal stone risk during
spaceﬂight,[7] a preferable way to mitigate this risk is to increase ﬂuid consumption. On space
missions water is a limiting resource, but one that must be available to maintain hydration and
mitigate renal stone risk. For the future, the ability to effectively reclaim all water will be
required before exploration-olass missions can be contemplated.

The data presented here extend those presented in earlier publications documenting the
beneﬁts of heavy resistance exercise in increasing bone formation and allowing maintenance of
bone mineral density in the presence of increased bone resorption. In some cases (e.g., BSAP),
the larger number of subj eots reported here statistically solidiﬁes trends noted earlier,[3]
although bed rest exercise studies had previously documented this effect.[6, 31] Parathyroid
hormone further ﬁlls in this picture: access to the iRED resulted in a 40-5 0% drop in PTH during
ﬂight compared to preﬂight concentrations (Figure 2), matching observations from both Russian
space station Mir missions, where no resistance exercise was available,[20, 21] and sedentary
bed rest studies.[6, 32] Use of the iRED exercise hardware thus failed to prevent the reduction in
circulating PTH from the preﬂight concentration, which occurred during spaceﬂight without
resistance exercise.[21] Such a reduction in PTH was also observed with the ARED exercise
device early in ﬂight, but PTH returned to preﬂight levels later in ﬂight (Table 2), a time course
similar to that of the bone formation markers. Circulating PTH tended to increase in the
bisphosphonate-treated group during ﬂight but was likely underpowered to show signiﬁcance
(Figure 2). An increase in PTH would probably represent the body’s attempt to maintain serum
calcium, made more difﬁcult by the action of the pharmaceutical agent. This same pattern,
reﬂecting the body’s maintenance of serum calcium in the presence of pharmaceutically
suppressed bone resorption, was observed in bed rest studies evaluating bisphosphonates.[33, 34]

12

"
"14","We report here for the ﬁrst time data for several bone and biochemical markers in
samples collected from astronauts during ﬂight, including sclerostin, IGF-1, osteoprotegerin
(OPG), and RANKL. Sclerostin is upregulated in bone-embedded osteocytes in response to
skeletal unloading and is an inhibitor of 0ste0blast bone formation through the Wnt signaling
pathway. Increased circulating levels have been observed in stroke patients,[35] and we have
previously reported a 40% increase in sclerostin during bed rest in sedentary (i.e., n0n-exereised)
individuals.[3 6] The high degree of intersubj eet variability of selerostin in the iRED group and
the lack of a change (or perhaps a nonsigniﬁeant upward trend) in selerostin in astronauts during
ﬂight (Figure 3, right panel) for the ARED group suggests that the in-ﬂight exercise protocols
(with or without bisphosphonate treatment) provided sufﬁcient mechanical loading to the
osteocytes, the putative gravity-sensing cells, to suppress sclerostin production. The ARED and
Bis+ARED groups had 10-15% increases in sclerostin, as did the iRED group when the 2
outliers were removed (Figure 3), although this was not statistically signiﬁcant. Others have
shown a 30% increase in selerostin during untreated bed rest, with resistance exercise tending to
dampen this increase to only 15-20% above pre-bed rest concentrations.[31] Additional studies
with sclerostin assays haVing higher sensitivity may solidify these first spaceﬂight ﬁndings. The
ﬁnding of an increase in the serum RANKL/OPG ratio early during ﬂight (ﬂight day 15)
supports the presence of an osteoclastogenic stimulus, regardless of exercise or pharmacologic
agent used. The ratio quickly returned to baseline by ﬂight day 30; this may have resulted from
a steady increase in exercise during ﬂight.

The ﬁnding that IGF-l was increased in all groups likely reﬂects an intertwined
relationship of exercise effects on muscle and bone, with interrelated dietary effects. Exercise
alone does not always lead to increased IGF-l concentrations, but exercise reactivation of lining
cells to 0ste0blasts[3 7] or stimulation of osteocytes[3 8] could account for increased production
of IGF-1.[3 9, 40] Ground-based training studies with the ARED[41] have noted effects on IGF-
1, and increases have been observed in bed rest exercise studies.[42] IGF-l regulates bone
growth and f0rmati0n.[43] It is reduced by restriction of dietary energy and/or protein,[44-46]
which has not been a concern on recent ISS missions.[3, 4, 18] Protein intake was 1.1 i 0.2, 1.2
i 0.5, and 1.5 i 0.3 g/kg body weight for iRED, ARED, and Bis+ARED subjects, respectively.

13

"
"15","All of these protein intakes are much higher than the current RDA, and are within the
recommendations for high-intensity athletes.[47]

In the growing body of literature on bone biochemistry during spaceﬂight and ground-
based analogs, the consistency of ﬁndings is reassuring, especially given the varied nature of
these studies. Despite myriad confounding factors, including seX, dietary intake, exercise
devices, pharmacological countermeasures, and mission duration, the regulation of bone and
calcium homeostasis appears intact. Untreated spaceﬂight (or bed rest) leads to a hyper-
resorptive state, which can be countered pharmacologically 0r mitigated through exercise-
induced increased bone formation. Nutritional support is integral to success of these
countermeasures, and as we have reiterated here, important questions remain about the effect of
the exercise-induced remodeling on bone strength and fracture risk.

Acknowledgments

We thank the astronauts who participated in this study for their time, effort, and
dedication to the success of this proj ect. Spaceﬂight studies are complicated, and require teams
of individuals to ensure that all details are captured, implemented, and documented according to
plan. Although we cannot thank each individual, we thank and recognize the Human Research
Program, its Human Health Countermeasures Element, and the International Space Station
Medical Proj ect. The NASA Nutritional Biochemistry Laboratory was responsible for protocol
coordination, sample collection and processing, and the biochemical analyses and data
management. We thank Mary Bouxsein for helpful discussion regarding the sclerostin data and
J ane Krauhs for editorial assistance.

The studies described here were funded by the NASA Human Research Program,
speciﬁcally the Human Health Countermeasures Element. Support was also provided in part by
grant WB 0931 from the German Aerospace Center (DLR), Germany.

FD, ﬂight day; Int, interaction; Pre, preﬂight mean. The urinary supersaturation data indicate risk of stone formation and are compared to the non-stone-forming
population; values greater than 2.0 for brushite, calcium oxalate, sodium urate, and uric acid supersaturation indicate an increased risk; values greater than 75 for
struVite indicate an increased risk. [29]
Data are mean i SD. A 2-Way repeated-measures analysis was completed to determine group and time effects.

Highlights
0 Heavy resistance exercise does not mitigate increased bone resorption in space.
0 Heavy resistance exercise increases bone formation markers during spaceﬂight.
0 Increased renal stone risk during spaceﬂight is largely related to urine volume.
0 Regulation of bone and calcium homeostasis during space ﬂight appears intact.
o Exercise-induced remodeling might affect bone strength and fracture risk.
