34 ABSTRACT
35
g: The Constrained Vapor Bubble (CVB) experiment concerns a transparent, simple, ""Wickless"" heat
38
39 pipe operated in the microgravity environment of the International Space Station (188). In a microgravity
4O
41 environment, the relative effect of Marangoni ﬂow is ampliﬁed because of highly reduced buoyancy
42
43 driven ﬂows as demonstrated herein. In this paper, experimental results obtained using a transparent 3O
44
45 mm long CVB module, 3 X 3 mm in square cross-section, With power inputs of up to 3.125 W are
46
3:; presented and discussed. Due to the extremely low Bond number and the dielectric materials of
:3 construction, the CVB system was ideally suited to determining if dry-out as a result of Marangoni forces
51
52 might contribute to limiting heat pipe performance and exactly how that limitation occurs. Using a
53
54 combination of Visual observations and thermal measurements, we ﬁnd a more complicated phenomenon
55
56 in Which opposing Marangoni and capillary forces lead to ﬂooding of the device. A simple one-

17 1. INTRODUCTION
18
19 Heat pipes, are passive heat transfer devices frequently used in high heat ﬂux applications. They are
20
21 especially attractive in microgravity environments Where the low Bond number allows for signiﬁcant heat
22
:2 transfer, and the device's robustness and reliability are extremely attractive features. Heat pipes operate
3: primarily Via capillary action. Liquid is evaporated from an extended meniscus at the hot end, ﬂows to
27 . . . . .
28 the cold end Where it condenses in another extended meniscus, and then the cooled liquid ﬂows back
29
30 towards the hot end Via capillary action. Liquid return to the hot end often occurs Via a Wick, but Wickless
31
32 designs With sharp corners also work well, especially in the case of micro heat pipes.
33
34 Heat pipes, and especially micro and miniature heat pipes that are essentially unaffected by gravity,
35
g: are well-understood devices and the equations governing their operation and limitations have achieved
:3 much attention [1]. The isothermal, vapor-liquid distribution inside a conﬁned geometry such as a heat
40 . . . . .
41 pipe was theoretically described by Aja€V and Homsy [2, 3]. Many papers have been published that
42

model the trans ort erformance of heat i es and es eciall micro heat i es, since the latter are
43 P P P P P Y P P
44
45 unaffected by gravity. Cotter [4] published the original micro heat pipe paper in 1984. Peterson [5] and
46
47 F aghri [6, 7] have written excellent reviews of micro heat pipe research and development that discuss
48
:3 both experimental investigations and the models developed to predict heat pipe performance. KhrustaleV
g; and F aghri [8] and Swanson and Peterson [9] have used models based on the augmented Young-Laplace
53 . . . . . . .
54 equation to analyze evaporation processes 1ns1de a micro heat pipe. Babin et a1. [10] presented a steady-
55
56 state model that assumes prior knowledge of the liquid ﬁlm proﬁle in order to compute the liquid and

2 vapor pressure drops inside the device. Longtin et al. [1 l] have also developed a one- dimensional model
3 to predict the operating parameters of the micro heat pipe. Bowman and Maynes [12] developed
7
8 analytical expressions for the heat-pipe ﬁn temperature distributions and compared these predictions with
9
10 a solid ﬁn. Bowman et al. [13, 14] used a lumped inside heat transfer coefﬁcient to describe the thermal
11
12 performance of a heat pipe with a vapor core and compare that to a solid ﬁn.
13
1: Heat pipes suffer from a number of performance limitations intimately tied to the dynamics of the
1675 evaporating meniscus and the geometry of the device [6]. These limitations include the capillary, boiling,
18 sonic, and entrainment limits. Suman et al. [15] created a model for a “V” rooved, re ular ol onal
19 g g p yg
2O
21 heat pipe geometry and used that model to determine the capillary limit and dry-out length of the device.
22
23 Xu and Carey [16] developed an analytical model that was used to predict the heat transfer characteristics
24
25 and the role of disjoining pressure in ﬁlm evaporation on a mierogrooved surface. Stephan and Busse [17]
26
3:3 developed a numerical model exploring the details of this extended, evaporating meniscus. Ma and
3% Peterson [18] developed a model to predict the maximum capillary heat transport capacity of a liquid
3; ﬂowing in V—shaped grooves and experimentally veriﬁed their predictions. Catton and Stroes [19]
33
34 developed a semi-analytical model to predict the eapillarity limit of a similar, heated inclined triangular
35
36 groove. Kihm and Pratt [20] demonstrated that interfacial, thermoeapillary stresses can be counteracted
37
38 by introducing naturally occurring concentration gradients associated with distillation in binary ﬂuid
39
3:? mixtures. Migliaeeio et al. [21] studied the evaporating meniscus in a V groove and established the
:3 importance of the evaporating thin ﬁlm region to the total meniscus heat transfer. Holm et al. [22] studied
3:: an analytical model of the evaporation of liquid in capillary grooves predicting the surface heat transfer
46
47 coefﬁcients of the wetted surface. Panehamgam et al. [23] have done a comprehensive study of ﬂuid ﬂow
48
49 and heat transfer occurring in the contact line region of an evaporating meniscus in a miniature heat
50
51 exchanger.

2 of water was presented by J ames Thompson in 1855 [25]. Since then, researchers have studied the role of
g Marangoni ﬂows in crystal growth [26], alveolar stability of lungs [27], bi-component droplet gasiﬁcation
E73 [28], spreading of liquid mixtures on a solid surface [29] etc. Marangoni ﬂow is also responsible for
S190 interfacial turbulence phenomenon observed between two unequilibriated ﬂuids [30], rates of heat and
1:23 mass transfer [31] and diffusion accompanied by a chemical reaction [32]. It is well known that modiﬁed
1: ﬂow patterns associated With Marangoni forces are generated When a signiﬁcant temperature gradient is
1‘; present [33 - 35]. Studies on a ﬂat surface have demonstrated that this surface tension gradient is able to
13 induce wetting ﬂuids to climb against the action of gravity. Other Marangoni driven behaviors have also
3(1) been observed, including ﬁngering instabilities and tear drop formation [35 - 39]. Carles and Cazabat [34]
3% explained the origin of the characteristic ﬂat ﬁlm associated With a Marangoni-driven coating ﬂow.
2% Boiling Within an evaporating meniscus induced by Marangoni ﬂow [40, 41] and the use of Marangoni
3:3 forces to enhance boiling heat transfer [42] have also been studied.
33 Mathematical models have been developed studying the effect of interfacial phenomena for ﬂow and
g; bubbles in a square channel [43]. The possibility of signiﬁcant Marangoni ﬂow Within the conﬁnes of a
:2 heat pipe or groove has been discussed and modeled by Yang and Homsy [44], Markos, AjaeV, and
g: Homsy [45], and Savino and Paterna [46]. All these authors have shown that if the interfacial tension
gg decreases With increasing temperature, the resulting Marangoni forces lead to an extended dry-out region
3:? at the heater end and a reduction in heat pipe performance. At certain temperatures in water/alcohol
:3 solutions, the surface tension of the ﬂuid increases With temperature contrary to the behavior observed in
3:: other ﬂuids [47] and is thus termed as “reverse” Marangoni effect. Experiments have been carried out on
:3 the thermoeapillary motion of drops of parafﬁn oil in an ethanol/water mixture in the reduced gravity
:3 environment of the European space sounding rockets [48]. The dry-out predictions from the model [44-
5: 46] also led to the experimental work of Savino et a1 [49], di F rancescantionio et a1 [50] and Armijo and
:2 Carey [51] Who have used water/alcohol mixtures to assist ﬂuid movement to the heater end of the device.
:3 Veriﬁcation of these Marangoni effects have relied primarily on temperature measurements to indicate
E; that ""dry-out"" was occurring. Ha and Peterson [52] directly observed dry-out by measuring the length of

2 their evaporator region but their system decoupled evaporation from condensation and eliminated
3 communication between one end of the device and the other. No one has actually observed the liquid-
7
8 vapor distribution or fully modeled that distribution in a complete working heat pipe where signiﬁcant
9
10 Marangoni forces may be present. Thus, we do not know whether the physical mechanisms outlined in
11
12 the models and the heat pipe limitations associated with those models truly occur.
13
1: In this paper we Visually show and thermally identify the effect that the competition between
1: capillary pressure gradient and Marangoni stresses at the hot end of the device on the performance of a
1: ""wickless"" heat pipe. The simple, one-dimensional, thermal ﬂuid model gives the essence of the
20
21 following: 1) the temperature signature associated with this particular performance limitation; 2) some of
22
23 the interfacial characteristics of the complicated ﬂow ﬁelds; and 3) how the performance limitation arises.
24
25 In our experiments, we ﬁnd that very complicated ﬂow ﬁelds lead to ﬂooding of the heated end, and not
26
3573 dry-out. Since the ﬂow ﬁelds are fully three-dimensional, the complete details of the basic phenomena
38 require extensive future numerical and theoretical analysis.

6 The experiments discussed herein were conducted on the International Space Station as part of the
7
8 Constrained Vapor Bubble program. The heart of the system is shown in F igure 1 and has been discussed
9
10 in detail in previous publications [53 - 57]. The heat pipe portion of the apparatus was fabricated from a
11
1% fused silica cuvette. Pentane served as the working ﬂuid. An electrical resistance heater was attached to
1: one end and a thermoelectric cooler was attached to each face of the opposite end to control the overall
1 . . . . . .
1675 temperature difference. Most of the heat input to the deV1ce was d1ss1pated t0 the surroundings by
18
19 radiation. This was unavoidable due to the requirements for Visualization and thermal symmetry. The
20
21 inside dimensions of the device were 3 X 3 X 30 mm. The heat pipe was packaged in a liquid cooled
22
23 container that allowed for full ﬁeld of View Via a surveillance camera or detailed ﬁlm thickness
24
3: measurement using a microscope. Thermocouples were installed at 1.5 mm intervals along the wall of
3:3 cuvette as well as in the heater and cooler sections. A pressure transducer provided for an overall
29 . . .
30 measurement of the pressure, which demonstrated that the vapor did not contain non-condensables.
31
32 Voltage and current measurements were used to determine the power supplied to the heater. In this paper,
33
34 experiments using a 30 mm CVB with electrical power inputs between 0 and 3.125 W are discussed.
35
36 The Bond number is a dimensionless number measuring the ratio of gravitational force to surface
37
g: tension force and is given by equation [1]:
4O 2
h
41 B0 = % (1)
42
:2 where, p is the density of the ﬂuid, g is the acceleration due to gravity, Y is the surface tension of the
45
46 liquid and h is the appropriate linear dimension. The measured acceleration transient 0r g-jitter averaged
47
48 over the period in which experiment was run was found to be 0.19 pg. The Bond number on Earth ranged
49
50 between 0.8 and 27 whereas on the 188, based on the g-jitter was between 1.5><10'7 and 5><10'6 over the
51
:3 temperature range of our experiments, 273 K to 463 K.

2 Relatively 10W magniﬁcation surveillance images of the 30mm CVB for different power inputs in
g microgravity are presented in Figure 2. The vapor-liquid distribution is quite complex, especially at the
7
8 higher power inputs. At OW, the constant volume, pure vapor bubble prefers to be attached to the Ineonel
9
10 cold-ﬁnger, Visible as the dark rectangle 0n the right. As soon as power is applied to the heater, the bubble
11
12 migrates toward the heater end. Up to 0.6 W, the temperature gradient is not signiﬁcant enough to offset
13
1: capillary ﬂow as can be seen at higher power inputs. The focus of this paper lies Within the region
1675 deﬁned as the ﬁrst 10 - 12 mm from the heater end. It is here Where the most signiﬁcant interfacial
13 effects are observed. The extent of this region begins at the heater wall and ends just beyond the bottom
20
21 0f the drop-like region that appears as a light spot near the heater end and is most evident at the higher
22
23 heat inputs in the higher magniﬁcation images presented later in Figure 4. Even in the low magniﬁcation
24
25 images, capillary ﬂow towards and ﬂooding at the hot end are obvious. The thick liquid regions appear as
26
3:3 continuous dark areas conﬁned to the corners of the cuvette. The images are essential to the
3% understanding of the phenomenon discussed in this paper.

13
1: The temperature proﬁle along the device was measured using thermocouples installed within the
1: outer wall of the cuvette. Wells (0.45 mm deep) were drilled into the fused silica surface and the
1: thermocouple junction was embedded using thermal paste. The thermocouples were calibrated prior to
20
21 launch and had a stated accuracy of i0.5 K. Temperature readings were recorded at 2.40 s intervals once
22
23 the system reached steady state. The pressure transducer data were collected at the same time intervals as
24
25 the thermocouple data. The pressure transducer had a range of 37 - 331 kPa with an accuracy of 0.69 kPa
26
3573 and was incorporated primarily to check for system leaks. At room temperature the CVB was at sub-
5,8 atmospheric pressure. The temperature data for the 30 mm CVB are presented in Figure 3 for power

:2 inputs ranging from 2.2 to 3.125 W. Each curve represents an average of at least twenty separate
33
34 measurements obtained once the device reached a steady state. These average measurements were then
35

37
38 possible. Figure 3b was generated by differentiating the spline functions ﬁt to Figure 3a.

18
19 Using the temperature data presented in F igure 3 for power inputs ranging from 2.2 to 3.125 W.
20
21 and the surveillance images in F igure 2, we conceptually separated the device into several distinct regions
22
23 as discussed in [57]. Since we were interested in that part of the heat pipe where we have high
24
25 temperature gradients, we focused our attention onl 0n the ortion 0f the re ion to the left of the reen
26 Y P g g
3:3 dots in F igure 3a. Those dots represent the point where net ""evaporation"" of liquid changes over to net
29 . . . . .
30 ""condensation"" of vapor. We ﬁnd we can also d1V1de the system into a region above what appears to be a
31

central drop, a region located on the central dro , and a re ion below the central dro . These re ions can
32 P g P g
33
34 be seen in F igure 4a and all eXist several millimeters above where condensation begins to occur on the
35
36 walls of the CVB. The region above the central dro we call the ‘Interfaeial ﬂow re ion’. It is here that

3:? drive liquid pentane in the corner of the euvette from the heater end toward the cooler end. The
42 . . . . . .
43 Marangoni driven ﬂow faces an opposmg ﬂow that occurs due to the capillary pumping from the section
44
45 below the central drop (F igure 4a and 4b). Below the drop, capillary forces are driving the condensed
46
47 liquid from the liquid pool at the cooler end toward the heater end. The opposition between Marangoni
48
49 and capillary ﬂows gives rise to spillover of liquid from the corner of the euvette onto the ﬂat surface.
50

2 thickness and foot length grow, the conduction resistance through the ﬁlm increases and so the driving
3 force for evaporating the liquid decreases. Thus, the performance of the heat pipe should decrease with
7
8 increasing power input once the interfacial region has developed signiﬁcantly. This scenario is supported
9
10 by F igure 82 in the supplemental section, where a simple, one dimensional heat transfer model was used
11
12 to extract information about the internal heat transfer coefﬁcient in the evaporator portion of the 30 mm
13
14 heat pipe [54, 55]. This coefﬁcient reaches its maximum at about 1.2 W and steadily decreases with
15
1‘; increasing power input.
1: Other researchers have observed and modeled a decrease in heat pipe performance as the power
20
21 level is increased and have associated it with dry-out of the heater end of the device [44-46, 49, 50].
22
23 However, in the CVB conﬁguration, we see that dry-out does not occur, but that the origin of the
24
25 reduction in performance is exactly the opposite phenomenon, ﬂooding of the hot end. Moreover, even
26
3:3 though the hot end is ﬂooded, the liquid ﬁlm thickness is relatively large, and the wall temperature is
:3 much higher than the boiling point of pentane at the measured pressure, no boiling is observed up to the
g; limits of operation allowed aboard the ISS. Evaporation from the ﬁlm surface must still be too high to
33 . . .
34 permit b01ling.
35
36 In addition to the data in F igure 82 whose peak in heat transfer coefﬁcient could be used as an
37
38 indicator of heater end ﬂooding, we were also interested in whether a simple l-D heat transfer model
39
3:? could provide more information about the processes occurring in F igure 2 and allow us to locate a
:3 temperature proﬁle signature that might indicate the interfacial ﬂooding effect. This would be very useful
3:: in cases where Visualization is impossible and one is interested in distinguishing between the dry-out and
46 .
47 ﬂooding.

3 conduction gradient down the glass walls of the CVB shown in Figure 6b and the internal heat transfer
7
8 rate shown in Figure 60 show a number of characteristic features that indicate the presence of the ﬂooded
9
10 region. The change in Figure 6c is perhaps the most dramatic. Here one can see that the internal heat
11
12 transfer rate changes from transferring heat from the wall to transferring heat to the wall near the heater
13
1: wall. This bending of the curve near the heater end and the presence of a local minimum in the q’m
1‘; proﬁle is the signature needed to identify heater end ﬂooding formed due to the competition between
1: capillary and Marangoni forces. The local minimum roughly tracks the location of the central drop,
20
21 especially so at the higher power inputs When the Marangoni stresses are most signiﬁcant.
22

2 coating ﬂow. The scale of the microscope is 1.281 p/pixel. So, the wall thickness or hprOJ-ected is obtained
3 by multiplying the number of pixels in the gray scale image with the scale of the microscope. The
7
8 measured thickness proﬁle of the liquid in this region is shown in F igure 7a. The length of the foot and
9
10 the ﬁlm thickness are both functions of power input. It is important to note that the thickness measured in
11
12 Figure 7a is actually a projected meniscus thickness onto the two-dimensional surface imaged. A truer,
13
1: average ﬁlm thickness is obtained by considering the general shape of a corner meniscus and how that
1675 translates into the gray-seale image we see. The thickness presented in F igure 7b is a good estimate of
13 what we feel the true thickness might be. This approximation leads to the corrected thickness shown in
20 .
21 F igure 7c.
22

1: A signiﬁcant difference is observed in the 1iquid-vapor interface temperature gradient proﬁle with
1675 respect to the solid wall temperature gradient as shown in Figure 9. The observed difference is mainly
13 because of signiﬁcant heat removal in the transition region due to evaporation [23] and also due to
20
21 conduction heat transfer resistance in the wall to transfer heat into the liquid layer. The absolute value of
22
23 the temperature gradient at the wall increases with increasing power input but the absolute value of the
24
25 temperature gradient at the 1iquid-vapor interface decreases with increasing power input. This indicates
26
3:3 that there is a decrease in the Marangoni effect with an increase in the power input and an increase in
:3 ﬂooding. This is mainly a result of the surface tension decreasing with increasing temperature as shown
3; in Figure 8a. The heated end is extremely complex since it includes three- dimensional variations in
33
34 radiation, conduction, evaporation, condensation, ﬂuid ﬂow and interfacial forces. The inclusion of these
35
36 terms in the model would predict more accurate 1iquid-vapor temperature gradient but using this model
37
38 with the given assumptions, we were able to model the gist of these complex processes with a simple

32 Mathematical models can be developed that can predict the average ﬁlm thickness, length of the
33
34 foot and the liquid-vapor interface temperature gradient as a function of power input. The heated end is
35
36 extremely complex since it includes three- dimensional variations in radiation, conduction, evaporation,
37
g: condensation, ﬂuid ﬂow and interfacial forces. So, three-dimensional mathematical modeling of these
40 . . .
41 details awaits future analys1s.
42
43 MicrograVity operation has resulted in the observation of a new limitation to heat pipe operation,
44
45 the combined effects of Marangoni and capillary forces. The Marangoni effect occurs When temperature
46
47 gradients near the heater lead to a signiﬁcant Marangoni stress at the vapor-liquid interface that impedes
48
48 capillary pumping of the ﬂuid towards the hot end. Signiﬁcant capillary gradients occur because of the
5
g; sharp comers. While this may be a consequence of the design of the CVB system, it is difﬁcult to say
:3: deﬁnitively since this is the ﬁrst time liquid ﬁlm thicknesses 0n the walls of a heat pipe operating in
55
56 microgravity have been measured.

6 CONCLUSIONS:
7
8 Both Visual observations and thermal measurements are essential for understanding the
9
10 performance limitation caused by a complex, interfacial ﬂow region at the hot end of a ""Wickless"" heat
11
13 pipe. The surveillance images of the CVB 30 mm module show the shape of the region and therefore the
1: capillary pressure gradient. The temperature measurements show the presence of Marangoni shear
1 . . . . .
1675 stresses. A newly developed, Simple, 0ne-d1mens10na1 stress model based on interfaeial forces was used
18
19 to analyze the shape of this region. The results indicate that the performance of the heat pipe is not
20
21 limited by reaching a 'dry-out' region but by 'ﬂooding' of this region by the working ﬂuid. Both
22
23 descriptions based only on temperature proﬁles decrease the effective length of the heat pipe and
24
3: therefore its performance. However, the pictures demonstrate that the cause is ﬂooding. Since the ﬂow
3:3 ﬁelds are three-dimensional, the complete details of the basic phenomena require extensive future
