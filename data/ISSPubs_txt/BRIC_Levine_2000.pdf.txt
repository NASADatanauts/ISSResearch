ABSTRACT
As part of the “Cellular Mechanisms of Spaceﬂight—Speciﬁc Stress to Plants” experim ent, nine BRIC (Biological
Research in Canisters) 100VC canisters, each containing four 100 mm dia polycarbonate petri dishes with
embryogenic daylily (Hemerocallis sp.) cultures, were launched on 12 Jan 97 (STS-8l), transferred to ‘Mir’ and
returned on 24 May 97 (STS-84). Pre-ﬂight, ﬂight and ground control data for temperature, relative humidity,
CO2 and ethylene in the BRIC canisters are presented. © 2000 COSPAR. Published by Elsevier Science Ltd.
INTRODUCTION '
Interplay among cell cycle controls, morphological complexity and the space env ironment has been studied using
somatic embryos (in vitro) as model deveIOping systems (Krikorian, 1996a,b,c). Aberrant growth and nuclear
abnormalities observed in some space—grown samples were due to a combination of factors including biological
status, culture protocols, and multiple stresses, some of which were microgravity—related. The problem arises as
to how to separate cause and effect relationships relating to direct microgravity effects vs indirect effects. The
“Cellular Mechanisms of Spaceﬂight-Speciﬁc Stress to Plants” experiment was designed to address some of these
questions, speciﬁcally whether mic rogravity alters the water and gaseous relations of developing cells growin g on
substrates with different water potential characteristics. This aspect is crucial because the availability and
behavior of water in microgravity is signiﬁcantly different ﬁom that on earth. Changes in water relations and
distribution of gases may induce stresses in sensitive developing cells which may result in aberrant nuclear
responses. To characterize the environm ental conditions to which the somatic embryos used in this experiment
were expose d, we present results obtained during pre-ﬂight, ﬂight and ground control experiments on the
temperature, relative humidity (RH), CO2 and ethy lene environm cuts to which the cultures were exposed. '
METHODS
Eighteen spaceﬂight and ground control BRICs (B iological Research In Canisters) version 100VC were washed
on 7 Jan and allowed to ‘air—dry’ on a laminar ﬂow bench for three days. On 10 Jan, temperature and RH data
loggers (HOBOTM; Onset, MA) were placed in six ﬂight plus six ground control canisters (three BRICs from each
set did not receive data loggers due to concerns with off—gassing). Embryogenic daylilly cells (Hemerocallis sp)
on standard 100 mm diam polycarbonate petri dishe s, were loaded into clips (four dishes/clip) and inserted into

each of the nine spaceﬂight plus nine control BRICs (Figure 1 A, B, C). All canisters were sealed and the flight
BRICs ﬂushed for ca 10 min (with a medical grade 5% C02, 20% O2 and 75% N2 gas mixture) from 16:40-18:00
(ail times EST), followed by the controls betweer: 18:10-19:40. Both the ﬂight and centre} canisters were then
stacked, placed in a foam cushion and housed within a Piroda transfer bag (Figure 1 D, E, F) within the same lab.
The ﬂight set was taken for installation into the Orbiter between 2:00-5:00, 11 Jan. At this time the ground
control BRICs were stowed in controlled storage at Kennedy Space Center (KSC). Another nine canisters were
maintained at Stony Brook, NY. The payload was launched on 12 January 1997 (STS-81) at 4:27, transferred to
‘Mir’ and stowed in the Krystall mo dule. No on-orbit manipulations were conducted. The payload returned after
132 days on 24 May 1997 (STS—84). We received the canisters ca 7 h aﬁer landing and collected gas samples
before open ing. The following morning the ground controi sampies stored at KSC were de-integrated and gas
samples collected.
RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
Fungal contaminants were found on the inside of the aluminum canisters and on the stainless steel clips from the
ﬂight BRICs, but all petri dishes with biological specimens were clean. The same contamination was present in
the KSC ground control canisters, but here 17 out of 36 dishes showed varyin g levels of contamin ation. Post-
ﬂight microbiological assessm ents revealed the presence of Penicillium sp., Aspergillus niger and Paecilomyces
81‘). The Stony Brook set of controls were aseptic.

Both ﬂight and ground control BRICs experienced temperatures primarily between 21-26"" C with the total range
l8-28° C (Figure 2A). Differences in temperature between spaceﬂight and ground controls were unavoidable
without ﬁequent ‘Mir’ temperature downlinks or access to well—eontrolled incubators on orbit. For Shuttle
experiments, downlinked temperature, CO2 and RH data are routinely used to provide comparable conditions for
ground control experiments. Lack of this option on ‘Mir’ likely had minimal impact since daylily somatic
embryo de velopme nt is not tightly tied to tem perature (unless extreme con ditions are encountered).
RH in the ﬂight BRICs reached 100% at 20-25 days whe teas the ground controls approached 100% within 1-2
days (Figure 2B). The more rapid rise in RH in the controls appeared even before turnover, and was therefore
independent of spaceﬂight. The pre—ﬂight BRIC canister processing proceeded serially from nine ﬂight un its to
the nine controls, and all were washed and handled under the same conditions. The ﬁrst data points for both data
sets (obtained prior to gas ﬂushing) were consistently ca 40% RH (Figure 2B insert). However, after 2.5 h, the
KSC control set had higher RH levels (ca 80%) compared to the ﬂight set (ca 18%). We have been unable to
resolve the cause for this divergence. Since all biological materials in the petri dishes were prepared at the same
time, using the same protocols, they should not be a source of variation. A post-ﬂight experiment that repeated
the ﬂushing procedure with the same gas cylinder, BRIC canisters and HOBO data loggers failed to reproduce
the pattern.
There was an unexpected failure of most of the data loggers. Flight HOB Os Operated for a mean duration of 84
days vs 37 for the ground controls. The higher RH levels in the ground controls may have contributed to more
rapid battery degradation. The higher RH may also have contributed to the greater levels of fungal contamination
in the controls. .
Closure provided by the BRIC IOOVCs was evaluated. In one te st, a BRIC was placed in a vacuum chamber and
the ambient pressure lowered to 9 psia (Figure 3). Pressure within the BRIC dropped within several hours to ca
14.2 psia, followed by a slow decline to 14.0 psia over the next 44 hrs. In another test, BRICs were ﬂushed with
5% CO2 and three replicate canisters were sacriﬁced for CO2 and ethylene gas sampling at 0, 7, 16, 45 and 77
days after ﬂushing (Figure 4). CO2 levels gradually decreased from 44,800 to 522 ppm over time along with
slight (but not statistically signiﬁcant) elevations in ethylene lev 613 (from 7 to 42 ppb).

These data indicate that while the canisters were nom inally ‘sealed,’ they leaked, albeit slowly. This may be
negiigibie fer a short duration experim ent, but for long duration studies there is a slew equilibration with the
ambient environme nt. 1n systems where accum ulated gases is a concern, a forced air ﬂow -through approach may
be more appropriate. But even this would require a cleansing ﬁlter to avoid deleterious eﬁects from volatiles in
the spacecraft. For exaxnple, background lev els of ethylene on—board ‘Mir’ have been reported to be routinely in
excess of 1,000 ppb (Salisbury et aL, 1997). These levels are high enough to induce physiological changes in
biological sy stems. Yet the BRICs here contained < 100 ppb ethylene in the canister space. (The canister gases
would, however, norm ally be expected to equilibrate with the gases inside the petri dishes despite the
poiy propyiene Paraﬁim ciosures. Whether this occurred in space was not addre ssed.)

CONCLUSIONS .
While nominally “simple/passive” experimental ﬂight packages have many adv antages, they present ch allenges so
far as critically evaluating the microe nvironments that occur within them. As used here, the ERIC IOOVC
canisters avoided many of the com plications oﬁen associated with conductin g 10 ng duration experiments on ‘Mir’
(including a ﬁre and seve re power re strictions that occurred duriag this particular mission). But as we move into
the International Space Station era, more effort must be expended to develop fastidiously-controlled growing
env ironments if inv estigators are to ultimately resolve the matter of what responses are attributable to the direct
versus indirect effects of spaceﬂight.
