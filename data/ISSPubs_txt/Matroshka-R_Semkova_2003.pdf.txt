ABSTRACT

Described is the Liulin~5 active dosimetric telescope designed for measurement of the space radiation dose depth-
distribution in a human phantom on the Russian Segment of the International Space Station (ISS). The Liulin-S
experiment is a part of the international project MATROSHKA-R on ISS. The MATROSHKA-R project is aimed
to study the depth‘ dose distribution at the sites of critical organs of the human body, using models of human body—
anthropomorphic and spherical tissue~equivalent phantoms. The aim of Liulin-S experiment is a long term (4-5
years) investigation of the radiation environment dynamics inside the spherical tissue—equivalent phantom,
mounted in different compartments. Energy deposition spectra, linear energy transfer spectra, and ﬂux and dose
rates for charged particles will be measured simultaneously with near real time resolution at different depths of the
phantom by means of three silicon detectors. Data obtained together with data from other active and passive
dosimeters will be ‘used to estimate the radiation risk to the crewmembers, which verify the models of radiation
environment in low Earth orbit. Presented are the test results of the prototype unit. Liulin~5 will be ﬂown on the
ISS in the year 2003. © 2003 COSPAR. Published by Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.

INTRODUCTION

Radiation exposure of crewmembers on manned space ﬂight has been recognised as an important factor in the
planning and design of such missions. Indeed, the effects of ionising radiation on crew health, performance and
life expectancy are a limitation to the duration of man’s sojourn in space. Predicting the effects of radiation on
humans during a long-duration space mission requires: i) accurate knowledge and modeling of the space radiation
environment, ii) calculation of primaiy and secondary particle transport through shielding materials and though the
human body, and iii) assessment of the biological effect of the dose.

In addition to trapped charged particles and albedo protons and neutrons, there will be a substantial number of
galactic cosmic ray (GCR) heavy ions at the ISS orbital inclination. An important issue is the biological effect of
cosmic heavy ions that is still not well known and is the subject of several research programs at an international
level (Durante, 2001),. and (Chaterjee, 2001). Highly energetic particles in the heavy ion component, typically
referred to as HZE particles, play a particularly important role in space dosimetry. HZE particles, possess high
linear energy transfer (LET) and are highly penetrating, giving them a large potential for radiobiological damage
(Benton, 2001). Particularly hazardous is the iron, which has relatively high abundance. Because of the highly

and internal material, including the astronaut’s bodies. For the estimation of the organ doses, and thus the radiation
risk, measurements in human phantoms are essential (Petrov et al., 1999). Several. research programs at an
intemati’onal level have been proposed to provide the necessary depth—dose-equivalent measurements using fully
instrumented phantoms on ISS. The 94-E039 - TORSO experiment (http:#hrf.isc.nasa.gov/science/e039.htm) has
been conducted in year 2001 on the USA Segment of ISS by NASA Johnson Space Center. And now the
MATROSHKA—R international experiment is planned for the Russian segment of ISS.
MATROSI-IKA-R INTERNATIONAL EXPERIMENT

The experiment MATROSHKA—R is aimed to study the depth -— dose distribution at the sites of critical organs
of the human body, using models of human body—anthropomorphic and spherical tissuewequivalent phantoms
(Petrov, 2000). The MATROSHKA—R experiment envisages long - term measurements of absorbed and equivalent
dose rates from all space radiation sources at different points inside phantoms located on the 188 external surface,
as well as inside the station. Depth-dose—equivalent measurements will be done as a function of spacecraft altitude,
location and time. Measurements in the phantoms will be supported by other radiation measurement
instrumentation.
Spherical Tissue—Equivalent Phantom

The spherical phantom consists of 13 tissue—equivalent layers. The diameter of the phantom is 350 mm, and
the weight is 30 kg. The layers beside the center have cylindrical openings, where passive dosimeters will be
placed. The central layer has 4 perpendicular channels. Inside three of the channels will be installed dosimetric
containers. The Liulin-S dosimeter will be mounted inside the largest channel (see Figure 1). Passive dosimeters
will be also placed on the outer surface of the phantom.
LIULIN-S DESCRIPTION

The Liulin-S is a further development of the Liulin active dosimeter (Dachev, et al., 1998a), variants of which

ﬂew for several years on the Mir space station.

Liulin-S Goals

The main goal is investigation of the radiation environment in the phantom on 188, which envisages:

1. Measurement of the energy deposition spectra, and then particle flux, dose rate and absorbed dose (D);

2. Construction of the LET spectra, and then assessment of the quality factor (Q(LET)) and dose equivalent
(H); H=DXQ(LET);

Simultaneous measurements with near real time resolution at three different depths of the phantom will be done by
Liulin-S.

Instrument block diagram

The Liulin-S consists of two units: a detector module, placed inside the phantom and an electronic block
outside it (see Figure 2).

The detector module will be mounted in a container in the form of a tube with dimensions of 175x30 mm. The
detector module contains three silicon detectors, D1-D3, arranged as a telescope, and placed at different depths of
the phantom, to measure the dose-depth distribution, and three charge sensitive preampliﬁers-shaping ampliﬁers,
CSAl-CSA3. The lay-outs of the detectors and electronics in the telescope of Liulin-S is shown in Figure 3. The
detector's thickness is 400 pm. The thickness of the sensitive volume of each detector is 300 pm, and the area is
176.6 mmz. The sensitive area of the D1 and D2 detectors is in front of the aperture of the telescope, while the
sensitive area of D3 detector is at the back of the telescope. There are different possible lay-outs of the detector
module inside the phantom. Each detector records the amount of energy deposited in the detector. The detectors
D1 and D2 operate in coincidence mode. If a particle enters the telescope within the 60-degree sensitivity cone,
and it has enough energy to make it through both the D1 and D2 detectors, it is considered a coincident event. The
data for this event is recorded, and is used to deﬁne the LET. The D3 detector is designed for measurement in the

center of the phantom.

absorbed dose rate measured in each of detectors. The real-time clock, keyboard, and visual display are
incorporated in the electronic module for the control of the instrument operation. The measured parameters can be
displayed and monitored on the LCD display by the operator commands. Different operational modes are pre—
programmed. Switching between modes is done automatically or manually. The output data contain the time of the
measurement, operational mode, and measured data.
Telemetry data

The instrument will provide:
0 Absorbed dose rate in the range 0.04 x10'6 Gy'h'] — 0.6 Gy'h‘l, measured by each of detectors.
0 Intensity of the particle ﬂux in the range 0 — 103 particle's'l, measured by each of detectors.
0 Energy loss spectra in the range 01-20 MeV in 256 spectral channels (low energy loss spectra, LELS)
measured by each of detectors; Energy loss spectra in the range 20—200 MeV in 240 spectral channels (high energy
loss spectra, I-IELS) measured by each of detectors.
0 LET spectra in the interval: 0.33 — 66.6 keV'pm’I in 256 spectral channels for LELS; LET spectra in the
interval 66.6 — 666 keV'tlm'l in 240 channels for HELS.
Measurement modes

The Liulin-S instrument perfonns measurements according to different operational modes:

0 Standard mode - Dose and ﬂux rates have a time resolution of 90 3, energy loss spectra and LET
spectra are constructed for every 1 hour of measurements; ‘
0 Fast mode - This mode will be used for measurements during crossing of the South Atlantic Anomaly
(SAA), or during Solar Proton Events (SPE). In this mode dose and ﬂux rates have a time resolution of 10 5,
energy loss spectra and LET spectra are constructed for every 15 min of measurements;

0 Calibration mode - This mode is used mainly for ground—based tests, so sampling intervals can be
switched on manually.

LABORATORY TESTS

The Liulin—S prototype has been electrically calibrated. The electrical calibrations were used to determine the
conversion functions of the ADCI-ADC3 channel numbers to the amplitude of the output signal of the respective
charge- sensitive ampliﬁer, for all 3 detectors and all sub-ranges of measurement.

Initial testing of the prototype was performed using 60Co gamma and 24lArn alpha sources. The purpose of
these tests was to characterize the response of the dosimetric telescope to types of radiation, to which the device
encounters in space ﬂight. ‘

1) The purpose of the ﬁrst test was to measure the response of each one of the detectors in the telescope to
gamma radiation. The 60C0 source of maximum photon energy 1173 keV was placed in front of the sensitive area
of detector D1 at distance 66 mm. The threshold of the discriminator was set to 80 keV. The sampling time was
150 s. In Figure 4 the distributions of the deposited energies in each of three detectors of the telescope are
presented. No coincidence events were registered in both ﬁrst and second detectors above 90 keV of absorbed
energy as measured by the D1 detector. For detector thickness of 300 pm, this means LET < 0.3 .keV‘pm'l, which
is typical for gamma rays. Figure 5 shows the count rates, which accordingly decreased in the detectors D1, D2
and D3 in order.

2) The purpose of the second test was to measure the response of the detectors in the telescope to alpha
particles, and to study the efﬁciency of the Liulin-S at high-count rates. The 241Am source was placed in front of
the sensitive area of D3 detector at several distances. The distributions in the D3, corresponding to distances of 37
and 20 mm are shown in Figure 6. The sampling time was 10 s. It was conﬁrmed that the deposited energy
measured was inversely prOportional t0 the path lengths of alpha particles in air. No spurious events or
coincidences were registered in other two detectors. The total number of events, measured in the D3 at the distance
of 20 mm was 4300 per second. The charged particle ﬂux inside [88 remains below 4300 per second (Dachev, e!
611., 1998b). This means that the Liulun-S has enough efﬁciency to measure the charged particle ﬂux inside the
station during crossing the SAA, or during SPE.

3) The purpose of the third test was to measure the response of the detectors t0 the low energy photons of
maximum energy 60 keV of the 241Am source. The 241Am source was placed in front the sensitive area of the third
detector at distance 20 mm. The detector was covered by Al foil of 20 pm thickness, which absorbs the alpha

particles. For this test the threshold of the discriminator was set to 40 keV. The time of the spectral measurement
was 200 s. The distribution of the deposited energies is represented in Figure 7, which corresponds to the photon
energies of the 241Am source.

CONCLUSIONS
The Liulin-S active dosimetric telescope was designed and developed for long-term measurements of

radiation environment parameters inside a tissue equivalent phantom on ISS.

Electrical calibrations and initial tests of the laboratory model with laboratory radioactive sources were
performed to obtain the metrological and calibration characteristics of the new device. The conversion functions of
the ADCl-ADC3 channel numbers to the amplitude of the output signal of the respective charge- sensitive
ampliﬁer, for all detectors and all sub~ranges of measurement were determined. The response of each one of the
detectors in the telescope to gamma radiation was measured. The obtained LET< 0.3 keV'um‘l is typical for
gamma rays. The tests with an alpha source showed that the counting rate of the Liulin-S is higher, than the
maximum counting rate, necessary to measure the charged particle ﬂux inside 188 during crossing the SAA, or
during SPE. The determined response of the telescope to the low energy photons 0f the 241Am source corresponds
to the photon energies of this source.

The ﬂight unit will be tested with particle accelerators. The MATROSHKA — R project, including experiments

with Liulin~5 will be carried out on the ISS in 2003.
