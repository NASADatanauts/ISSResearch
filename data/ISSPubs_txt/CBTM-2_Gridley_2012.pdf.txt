Abstract 0
Raw data derived from mass spectroscopic (MS) analyses of formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE) tissue
sections of the essential metabolic organ, liver, allocated by the provider (Amgen) from mice subjected to 13 days
of microgravity on NASA Flight STS-118 were analyzed by two different search engines, using shotgun proteomics.
With the eight statistically significant readouts in hand, Ingenuity Pathway Analysis (IPA) was employed to visualize
probable biologic pathway relationships among proteins that might be associated with alterations in liver biochemistry
due to space flight. Most noteworthy was the finding of up-regulation of the first urea cycle enzyme carbamoyl-
phosphate synthetase, consistent with increased amino acid catabolism resulting from gravitational changes, and/
or other stress associated with missions in space. Down-regulation of fructose-bisphosphate aldolase B, regucalcin,
ribonuclease UK114, alpha enolase, glycine N-methyltransferase and S-adenosyl methionine synthetase isoform
type-1 was observed. 60 kDa heat shock protein was elevated.
