Abstract: In the preparation for missions to Mars, basic knowledge of the mechanisms of
growth and development of living plants under microgravity (micro-g) conditions is essential.
Focus has centered on the g-effects 0n rigidity, including mechanisms of signal perception,
transduction, and response in gravity resistance. These components of gravity resistance are
linked to the evolution and acquisition of responses to various mechanical stresses. An
overview is given both 011 the basic effect of hypergravity as well as of micro-g conditions
in the cell wall changes. The review includes plant experiments in the US Space Shuttle and
the effect of short space stays (8—14 days) 011 single cells (plant protoplasts). Regeneration
of protoplasts is dependent on cortical microtubules to orient the nascent cellulose
microfibrils in the cell wall. The space protoplast experiments demonstrated that the
regeneration capacity ofprotoplasts was retarded. TWO critical factors are the basis for longer
space experiments: a. the effects of gravity on the molecular mechanisms for cell wall
development, b. the availability of facilities and hardware for performing cell wall experiments

1. Introduction

The plant cell wall in a growing plant is composed of a variety of oomponents—oellulose, matrix
polysaccharides, phenolios, and glycoproteins [1]. The wall, which surrounds the plant cell, is the maj or
source of mechanical strength and form and despite its rigidity it permits and facilitates growth. The
network of cell walls in a plant can be compared to both skin and bones in humans and animals. The cell
walls surrounding the plasma membrane deﬁne the boundaries of the cell itself and represent the place
where the plant cell meets a variety of environmental signals. In this way, the wall is the maj or location
of plant responses to such signals [2,3]. Located at the surface and forming the interface between
adj aoent cells, the wall plays an important role in cell intercellular communication.

This reView focuses on gravity as one of the environmental signals that is always present in a constant
direction and magnitude on Earth. Throughout evolution, plants have utilized gravity as the most stable
and reliable signal for their survival. The immediate effect of gravity enables plants to orient their leaves
towards sunlight and to develop a root system to anchor and absorb water and minerals. Plant
gravitropism is the most typical response when a plant is turned onto its side and the plant stem bends
upwards towards the gravity direction and the root grows the opposite way. This occurs both in light and
in darkness but the true gravitropio response requires darkness. It is also well recognized nowadays that
the best environment for studying plant gravitropism in order to elucidate the mechanisms behind gravity
effects is under microgravity conditions, 126., in space experiments.

Gravity resistance was introduced by one of the authors of the present article as a new term, and its
nature and mechanism were initially studied in ground-based experiments using hypergraVity conditions
produced by centrifugation [4,5]. More recently, the same authors performed a space experiment on the
International Space Station (188) to study the effect of microgravity on the gravity resistance phenomena [6].
These experiments were proposed and performed in order to explain that the initial curvature, the true
gravitropism, and the following straight growth against gravity are quite different in origin and mechanisms.
According to the results obtained, the mechanical resistance to the gravitational force may be a principal
graViresponse in plants, independent of gravitropism. In the present reView article, the results obtained,
which have clariﬁed the outline of the sequence of events in gravity resistance, will be described in more
detail. The role of the cell wall in gravity resistance in plants will also be further elucidated.

Since the experiments in space are dependent on the availability of plant cultivation facilities,
adequate hardware will be described in the present article. Historically, the reView starts with a link back
to the early plant experiments in the US Space Shuttle period. Initially, and due to the limited time
periods in space (up to 15 days), freshly produced plant cell protoplasts were used to study the effect of
short exposures to microgravity conditions and the effect on single cells. Plant protoplasts 116., cells from

"
"3","Plants 2015, 4 46
which the cell wall has been enzymatically removed, were produced immediately before the launch of
the space shuttle, and the initial effects of the cell wall regeneration was followed for the ﬁrst time under
mioro-g. Further on in the present article, a summary of these results obtained with cell walls is presented.
After the introduction of a functional 188 in 2005, cultivation of intact plants originating from seeds was
possible. The different types of facilities and their limitations and advantages for intact plant studies
focusing on growth and development of the cell walls are presented.

The end of this reView article deals with the molecular aspects of the cell wall development under
mioro-g conditions. In order to fully understand the cell wall composition, function, and regulation on
the Earth, it is expected that results from space experiments will be useful. For the optimal construction
of such experiments, sophisticated methods within molecular biology, molecular genetics, and genomics
will have to be applied. A key question here, which has not yet been answered, is how to obtain and
preserve RNA/DNA samples from the microgravity environment for further analysis on Earth.

2. Gravity Resistance

Plants show mechanical resistance to gravitational acceleration. Genetic and physiological evidence
indicate that this response, termed gravity resistance, is distinct from gravitropism. Weeping,
characterized by hanging branches, is caused by a genetic mutation. Weeping is not a mutant of
gravitropism, because branches of most weeping trees show normal gravitropism [7]. However, weeping
branches lose the capacity to maintain enough mechanical rigidity to resist gravitational acceleration [8].
On the other hand, stem organs of some aquatic or semi-aquatio plants such as rice ooleoptiles elongate
rapidly and grow more slender when underwater. This growth response is partly caused by reduction in
the gravitational acceleration actually applied to their bodies due to buoyancy, and it is reversible [2,8].
The rigidity of rice ooleoptiles when grown under submergenoe is lower than when grown in the air [2].
However, rice ooleoptiles show normal gravitropio curvature under submergenoe, as in the air [9]. In the
gravitropio curvature of stem organs and roots, the initial curvature, which represents true gravitropism,
and the following straight growth against gravity are quite different in origin and mechanism. Gravity
resistance may sustain the latter process [8]. The cell wall is the maj or source of mechanical rigidity for
plant bodies, and so it may be responsible for gravity resistance. Evidence obtained by the ground-based
studies and space experiments described below supports this hypothesis.

3. Gravity Resistance and Evolution

During evolution, a link has been created between the responses to various mechanical stresses and
the establishment of land plants. When plant ancestors ﬁrst emerged on land, probably about 450 million
years ago in the mid-Ordovioian, their bodies were surrounded by soft cell coverings, because it was not
necessary for them to develop hard bodies. Plant ancestors were directly exposed to a gravitational
acceleration of 1 g on land, and only plants that successfully evolved a tough body with rigid cell walls
were able to resist the force and survive on land [10,11]. The development of the mechanisms of gravity
resistance was indispensable for the transition of plant ancestors from an aquatic environment to a
terrestrial environment and the consequent establishment of land plants. On land, plants also have been
exposed to a variety of mechanical stresses, such as wind. An increase in cell wall rigidity is, as for the
gravity signal, generally induced in response to mechanical stimuli [12—14], the same. In addition, the

"
"4","Plants 2015, 4 47
pathway leading to gravity resistance, described below, may be at least in part common With that of
mechanical stresses. Thus, the development of the mechanisms of gravity resistance should be important
for the acquisition of responses to mechanical stresses for plants [8].

4. Mechanisms Controlling Gravity Resistance

The mechanism of gravity resistance consists of signal perception, transformation and transduction
of the perceived signal, and response to the transduoed signal, as is seen in other environmental responses
as well. The outline of the sequence of events in gravity resistance has already been described [5,15].
The gravity signal may be perceived by meohanoreoeptors (meohanosensitive ion channels) on the
plasma membrane, and it appears that amyloplast sedimentation in statooytes is not directly involved.
The signal should be then transformed and transduoed into the cells. Membrane sterols and cortical
miorotubules (CMTs) may be involved in this process. In the membranes, sterols consist of
miorodomains called rafts, and CMTs are linked to the rafts Via miorotubule-assooiated proteins (MAPS).
Because the functions of CMTs, the plasma membrane, and the cell wall are mutually and deeply
dependent, as shown by the results of studies using mutants and metabolic inhibitors, the structural
continuum or physiological continuity of these cellular components may play a key role in signal
transduction. The transduoed signal then may induce the expression of diverse genes inﬂuencing the
structure and function of various cellular components. These steps regulate the synthetic levels of cell
wall constituents. At the same time, transformed signals may be transduoed through the plasma
membrane, and they might modify the activities of proton pumps or other ion channels, Which regulates
the cell wall environment. The signal transduoed through the plasma membrane may also directly
inﬂuence cellulose synthase activity or exocytosis of Golgi vesicles. In addition, the changes in
orientation of CMTs may bring about reorientation of cellulose mioroﬁbrils. The modiﬁcations to the
cell wall environment, in combination With the changes in the levels and structure of the cell wall
constituents, determine the cell wall rigidity, leading to gravity resistance.

5. Cell Wall Changes under Hypergravity Conditions

Miorogravity conditions can be produced by free fall or parabolic ﬂight on Earth. However, the
microgravity obtained by these methods is generally too brief to induce obVious changes in plant growth
and morphogenesis. Therefore, hypergraVity generated from oentrifugation has been Widely used to
analyze plant responses to gravity. Since the pioneering study by Waldron and Brett [16] in pea seedlings,
the effects of centrifugal acceleration on growth and development have been analyzed in various plant
materials. As a result, hypergraVity has been shown to suppress elongation growth but promote the lateral
expansion of stem organs and roots [4,5,17]. The first analysis of changes in the mechanical properties
of the cell wall under hypergraVity conditions was carried out in garden oress seedlings [18]. It has been
conﬁrmed in various materials that hypergraVity increases cell wall rigidity [4,5].

The structural aspects of the wall under different gravity conditions are the basis for understanding
how the gravitational acceleration can inﬂuence the mechanical rigidity of the cell wall. The plant cell
wall consists of two phases: a oellulosio miorofibrillar phase and a matrix phase consisting of
polysaccharides, phenolios, and glycoproteins (see e.g., Carpita and Gibeaut [1]). The rigidity of the cell
wall is determined by the chemical nature of each wall constituent and the interactions among them,

"
"5","Plants 2015, 4 48
such as oross-link formation. In particular, the levels of wall constituents and the molecular mass of
certain matrix polysaccharides are important for the regulation of the rigidity. HypergraVity has been
shown to increase cell wall thickness in various organs [4,5,8]. In azuki bean epiootyls, hypergraVity
increased the level of cellulose mioroﬁbrils in the basal supporting regions, and those of matrix
polysaccharides in the upper growing regions [19,20]. Cellulose accumulation was also induced by
hypergraVity in pollen tubes [21]. On the other hand, hypergraVity caused the polymerization of certain
matrix polysaccharides, the types of which differed between dicotyledonous plants and monocotyledonous
Gramineae plants. In diootyledons, hypergraVity increased the molecular mass of xylogluoans, whereas
hypergraVity increased that of 1,3,1,4-B-gluoans in Gramineae plants. HypergraVity also decreased the
xylogluoan-degrading activity in diootyledons and 1,3,1,4-B-gluoanase activity in Gramineae. In
addition, modiﬁcations to xylogluoan metabolism under hypergraVity conditions were regulated by
prompt and differential changes in the expression of xylogluoan endo-transgluoosylase/hydrolase (XTH)
genes [22]. In pollen tubes, hypergraVity altered intracellular vesicle transport related to the synthesis of
matrix polysaccharides [21]. Thus, modification of the metabolic turnover of matrix polysaccharides as
well as their accumulation may be involved in making the cell wall mechanically rigid to resist the
gravitational acceleration under hypergraVity conditions.

Certain differentiated cell walls contain a signiﬁcant amount of phenolic substances such as lignin
and monophenols. The lignin content was increased in response to hypergraVity treatment in various
stem organs [8]. In wheat seedlings, the levels of monophenols, in particular of diferulio acid, were
increased under hypergraVity conditions [8]. Also, the activity of wall-bound peroxidase, which is
responsible for polymerization of lignin and the coupling reaction that produces diferulio acid, was
increased by hypergraVity [20,23]. The stimulation of oross-link formation by phenolios may increase
cell wall rigidity and thus enhance resistance to the gravitational acceleration.

6. Cell Wall Changes under Micro-g Conditions—Space Experiments

Experiments under true microgravity conditions in space are effective to study gravity responses in
plants. Opportunities for space experiments have been limited, but the situation was greatly improved
by the initiation of scientific operations on the 188. Growth and development of various organs has
been examined in space, but the results are controversial. Such a contradiction may be caused by
differences in culture conditions other than gravity, as well as differences in materials, age, and
parameters measured [4,5,17]. Careful consideration of these conditions has confirmed growth
stimulation under microgravity conditions in space at least in seedlings of Arabidopsis and rice and in
inﬂorescence stems of Arabidopsis [4,5 ,24,25]. The first analysis of changes in cell wall rigidity under
microgravity conditions in space was carried out in RICE experiments on the Space Shuttle STS-95
mission, and it was conﬁrmed that microgravity decreased cell wall rigidity in seedlings of Arabidopsis
and rice and inﬂorescence stems of Arabidopsis [4,5,25].

A comprehensive analysis of the chemical properties of the cell wall constituents was also conducted
in the RICE experiments. The levels of cellulose and matrix polysaccharides per unit length were lower
in the spaoe-grown rice ooleoptiles and Arabidopsis hypoootyls than the controls, indicating that microgravity
decreased the cell wall thickness. The spaoe-grown materials also had a lower molecular mass of the
matrix polysaccharides, which is mainly due to the decrease in the molecular size of 1,3,1,4-B-gluoans

"
"6","Plants 2015, 4 49
in rice and xyloglucans in Arabidopsis. In Arabidopsis hypoeotyls, the activity of xyloglucan-degrading
enzymes was also increased in space. These changes in cell wall properties are opposite to those induced
by hypergraVity, as mentioned above. These results support the hypothesis that under microgravity in
space the metabolic turnover of cell wall constituents of plant seedlings is activated, which leads to a
decrease in cell wall rigidity [4,5,8].

As to phenolics, the changes in content and formation of lignin under microgravity conditions in
space were ﬁrst analyzed in hypocotyls of pine and mung bean [26]. The lignin content in spaee-grown
materials was lower than in those grown at 1 g on Earth. Also, peroxidase activity in space-grown pine
hypocotyls was lower than that of ground controls [26]. On the contrary, there were no signiﬁcant effects
of microgravity 0n lignin content in seedlings or leaves of wheat [27,28]. This discrepancy may be due
to the differences in experimental conditions mentioned above.

7. Cell Walls and Gravity Resistance—Future Aspects

The results obtained by the ground-based studies and space experiments so far support the hypothesis
that plants increase the rigidity of their cell walls Via modiﬁcations to the metabolism of cell wall
constituents to resist the gravitational acceleration. However, the type of plant materials used in space
experiments is limited. Changes in cell wall properties need to be examined in further space experiments
to conﬁrm the universality of cell wall functions in gravity resistance. On the other hand, CMTs are involved
in gravity responses in plants through the regulation of the orientation of cellulose mieroﬁbrils, as discussed
below for the protoplasts. Under hypergraVity conditions, the expression of most Ot- and B-tubulin genes
was upregulated in Arabidopsis hypoeotyls, depending on the magnitude of the gravitational force [29,30],
and a reorientation of CMTs from transverse to longitudinal directions was induced [31]. To clarify the
role of CMTs in gravity resistance, we are conducting Resist Tubule (PI, T. Hoson) and Anise Tubule
(PI, K. Sega) space experiments on the J apanese Experiment Module “Kibo” 0f the 188.

The physiological functions of the cell wall are sustained by its intimate crosstalk with the symplast,
and the plasma membrane plays an important role in regulating the crosstalk [15]. As mentioned above,
mechanoreceptors located on the plasma membrane may be responsible for the perception of the gravity
signal, and membrane rafts play a role in transformation and transduction of the perceived signal in
gravity resistance. In addition, two other plasma membrane components, cellulose synthase complexes
and H+-ATPase (proton pump), are likely involved in gravity resistance [5,8,15]. The role of these
membrane components and the interaction among them in gravity resistance remain to be clariﬁed in
future space experiments.

8. Micro-g and Cell Wall Free Plant Cells (Protoplasts)

Historically, the review of the plant space experiments starts with a link back to the US Space Shuttle
period with focus on short stays in space and the effect on single cells. Important here is the use of plant
protoplasts i.e., cells from which the cell wall has been enzymatically removed. These cells represent a
uniform population of true single cells where tissue specific variations are eliminated. The totipotency
0f the plant cell makes the protoplasts isolated from mature differentiated tissue competent to express
genes that regulate mitotic activity. The lack of eell-to-eell interactions in newly isolated protoplasts
makes them ideal obj eets for environmental changes and systematic modiﬁcation of extracellular

"
"7","Plants 2015, 4 50
conditions. The effect of variations in graVity forces on cell wall regeneration can easily be detected in
the initial stages of the protoplast wall reconstitution. In this context, it should be stressed that this is
dependent on CMTs, which are believed to orient the nascent cellulose mioroﬂbrils in the regenerating
cell wall.

The earliest experiments using protoplast cells started on a satellite launched from the Soviet Union
in 1989 [32]. Rapeseed protoplasts were used and exposed for mioro-g conditions for 14 days on
Biokosmos 9 (Kosmos 2044). The maj or result of the space experiment was a significant decrease in the
content of cellulose and hemioellulose. A callus culture was established from the protoplasts, and after
retrieval a decreased number of peroxidase isoenzymes and a decreased total peroxidase activity were
also detected. The callus cultures established during the two-week—long ﬂight also showed a retarded
growth and division compared to the ground control [32,33]. An attempt to get the retrieved tissue cultures
to differentiate into mature plants was unsuccessful. Protoplasts exposed to simulated 0 g for 3 days on
a 2-D olinostat and protoplasts, which were permitted to regenerate cell walls at ground conditions (1 g),
were used as controls for the Biokosmos 9 experiment. A disadvantage of the Biokomos 9 experiment
was, however, the lack of a 1 g centrifuge on board the space vehicle. This meant that it was difficult
to differentiate between the effect of the weightlessness and the other environmental conditions
(e.g., cosmic radiation) under space conditions. Later on, Skagen [34] attempted to clarify the effect of
weightlessness compared to the other effects by using rapeseed protoplasts exposed to simulated 0 g.

The Biokosmos 9 experiment was followed by an experiment called “PROTO” which was ﬂown on
the Space Shuttle in 1992 with the IML-l (International MicrograVity Laboratory) mission [3 5—3 7]. Four
years later, a new mission (S/MM-03; Shuttle Mission to Mir-03) was launched where a protoplast
regeneration experiment was included. Both the IML-l and the S/MM-03 conﬁrmed some of the results
obtained in Biokosmos 9; after 8—11 days of mioro-g conditions the regeneration of the rapeseed
protoplasts was retarded and mature plants did not develop from the retrieved oalli obtained from the ﬂight
samples. In the space shuttle experiments, a oentriﬁage was placed on board the vehicle and ﬁanotioned as
a 1 g control. In addition, a 1 g ground control was used in the comparison to the micro- g results obtained.

The space ﬂight protoplast experiments have shown that the critical step in the regeneration of the
protoplast into an intact cell is the immediate reconstitution of the cell wall. In the period after the
enzymatic removal of the cell walls from the mother hypoootyl plant tissue, the intention was that the
oell-wall-free cells should be exposed to the mioro-g conditions in space. For technical reasons, the
protoplast samples in the experimental set-up were permitted to be placed in the shuttle cargo as a late
access delivery. This meant that the freshly isolated protoplasts were only 17 hours old when they were
exposed to the mioro-g conditions in space for the ﬁrst time. One of the astronauts on the shuttle had the
special task to microscopically observe that the cells still were at the cell wall free stage when the Space
Shuttle Bioraok laboratory was opened in space. This made it possible to follow the regeneration of the
walls throughout the complete space period from an early stage up until the small oalli had developed.
9. Protoplasts and Cell Wall Regeneration

Already in the 1980s, one of the authors of the present reView article knew that after the Space Shuttle
period, whereby plant cells were exposed space conditions for short periods, a new era with longer
duration cultivation of plants, and not only cells, would come in due time. Our space biology group had

"
"8","Plants 2015, 4 51
already been selected as one of the plant cell study groups with experiments for the Space Shuttle
Challenger in late 1986. Challenger was launched for the ﬁrst time in 1983 and after nine successful
ﬂights a disaster occurred, and the practical consequence for our group was that we were offered the
Biokosmos 9 experiment as an alternative.

Our protoplast experiments and the results obtained and experience gained should eventually lead to
preparation of an ISS experiment of longer growth duration. As a link to this work, Skagen [34], in her
PhD—thesis and in several articles [38—40], had focused on CMTs, which were believed to orient the
nascent cellulose microﬁbrils in the regenerating cell wall [41—44]. At that time, it was also known that
the amount of CMTs was anticipated to affect both the cellulose incorporation [45] and the division
capacity in cell cultures [46].

The importance of various g-forces and the orientation of CMTs in the protoplast cell wall
regeneration have been described by [40]. As demonstrated in Figure l [40], the protoplasts exposed to
l, 7 and 10 g reoriented the CMTs in parallel arrays while protoplasts exposed to simulated 0 g
conditions showed CMTs aligned in a random pattern after 48 hours. Based on the experience from the
protoplast experiment and the various g-effects 0n the cell wall regeneration, Skagen [34] selected a
number of key elements which should therefore be included in an 188 single cell experiment; the effects
of various g-forces and naphtaleneacetic acid (NAA) 0n the CMT organization, density, wall
reconstitution (cellulose synthesis and peroxidase activity), and evaluation of the signiﬁcance of a dense
parallel CMT array for cellulose incorporation and cell division.

A we11prepared experimental set—up using rapeseed single cells based on our basic protoplast knowledge
was submitted to BSA for tests on the 188. However, in the ﬁnal selection of our different proposals
submitted to BSA for experiments in the European Modular Cultivation System (EMCS) the use of
Arabidopsis thaliana as a model plant was given priority. Following is a summary of the adequateness
0f the EMCS for plant growth and development studies in general and the potential for future plant cell
wall studies.
10. The EMCS and Plant Space Studies

The EMCS (Figure 2) and also the parallel space laboratory called BIOLAB were the result of a
request to the ESA (the European Space Agency) from plant space scientists, and they were developed
by EADS Astrium (Friedriehshafen, Germany) on behalf of BSA. The idea was to design two dedicated
facilities to improve and standardize plant growth in the 188. The EMCS Flight Model (EMCS FM) was
brought to the 188 on the Space Shuttle ULF 1.1 in March 2006 after bio-eompatibility and functionality
tests [47]. The EMCS, which is the facility specially equipped for plant studies, has been equipped with
two eentriﬁages to perform experiments in microgravity with variable g—levels up to 2.0 g. Detailed
descriptions of the EMCS before being launched have been given by various authors [48—52]. In a more
recent reView article [53], the utilization of the EMCS 0n the 188 is presented.

The experience gained after 8 years of the EMCS in function on the 188 is that cultivation of higher
plants can be performed under fully controlled environmental conditions and for long growth periods.
So far, ten plant experiments have been perforrned(Tab1e 1). One of these, the MULTIGEN 1 experiment,
lasted for 85 days and Arabidopsis thaliana were grown from seeds to new plants producing embryos.
In this speciﬁc experiment, circumnutations were in focus and, using the Video technique (Figure 3)
developed for that experiment, detailed representation of their growth and development could be
followed over the total growth period as illustrated in Figure 4.

11. Space Experiments and Cell Wall Behavior

Despite the fact that the 188 has been in function since 2006 and quite a few plant experiments have
been performed, the majority of these are already linked to the effect of miero-g on higher plant
development. However, principally, samples could have been taken to observe the behavior of the cell
wall characteristics, but so far this has not been implemented in any of the ten experiments (Table 1)
performed in the EMCS.

The Cell Biology Experiment Facility (CBEF) installed in the Kibo Module also has been used for
plant cultivation up to 62 days [62]. As described previously, in the present review article, the growth
and cell wall mechanical properties ofAmbidopsis grown for 33 days were followed in the Space Seed
experiment on the Kibo Module on board the ISS [8]—f0r more detail on the results obtained see Section 6
“Cell Wall Changes under MierO-g Conditions—Space Experiments” in the present review. For the
scientiﬁc community interested in the effect of various gravity signals on the cell wall behavior, there

"
"12","Plants 2015, 4 55
are possibilities for using both the EMCS and the CBEF 0n the 188. However, due to the selection
procedure for potential cell wall studies and the long preparation period for 188 experiments, the present
authors would advise potential cell wall scientists to contact us in an attempt to implement new relevant
experiments in already accepted space experiments using the EMCS (e.g., Plant Development).

12. The Effects of Gravity 0n the Molecular Mechanisms for Cell Wall Development

Global gene expression analysis is a powerful tool to evaluate how plants adapt to microgravity.
There have been a few space experiments where the transcriptome of higher plants and cell cultures have
been compared with ground controls [60,63,64]. Stutte and eo-authors [28] reported that 820 of the
analyzed genes were found to be expressed both under microgravity and in the ground control samples,
but none of these were found to be above the two-fold eut-Off. Etiolated Arabidopsis seedlings and
undifferentiated cultured Arabidopsis cells have been exposed to microgravity during the BRIC— 16 ﬂight
on STS-131. The post-ﬂight analyses revealed transcription proﬁles that were quite similar for the cells
and tissues. The genes regulated a ﬁve-fold or less in microgravity, were mainly associated with pathogen
response and wounding. The response was moderate in the seedling, but more dramatic for the cell culture.
Genes associated with cell wall metabolism and cell elongation were among the genes encoding transcription
factors that were down regulated ﬁve-fold. As part of the TROPI—2 experiment [5 9] in EMCS, Arabidopsis
seedlings were used to perform transcriptome analyses [60]. The experiment was primarily designed to
study tropisms of plants using image analysis, and the preservation to ﬁx the seedlings for RNA
extraction 0n the rotor immediately following the experiment was not feasible due to hardware
limitations. Still, by comparing gene expression proﬁles from a range of gravity treatments, they were able
to identify genes involved in e.g., cell-wall development. Among the genes identified when comparing
spaceﬂight and ground were e.g., eXpansin-related genes (ATEXPA4, ATEXPA7), three extensin—related
genes (At4g08380, At5g06630 and LEUCIN—RICH REPEAT/EXTENSIN 1-LRX1) and pectinases and
ehitinases. When comparing the transcriptome of all the g-treated spaceﬂight samples with the
microgravity samples, only 27 genes were at least two-fold differently regulated and among them was a
cell wall kinase (WAK3, At1g48100).

The gene expression studies in space experiments are challenging because the time period from the
end of an experiment (126., after the stop of the 1>< g rotor) until the point in time when the samples are
preserved is critical. Studies have shown that genes are induced by gravity and mechanical stimulation
less than 2 min in the Arabidopsis root apex [65]. The time period from the end of an experiment
(1.6. , after the stop of the 1 X g rotor) until the samples are preserved is critical for gene expression studies.
The BPS growth system on 188 allows for a sample collection and preservation within 2 min [28]. For
samples in the EMCS, the preservation will vary depending of what kind of unique experiment
equipment is used. When using equipment like MULTIGEN—l and TROPI (see Table 1), approximately
1—1.5 h must be anticipated from the point in time when the rotor stops until the last sample is preserved.
This depends on how quickly the samples can be removed from the EMCS Experimental Container and
be inserted in e.g., MELFI (Minus Eighty Laboratory Freezer for 188; [66]). When using GRAVI-2
equipment (optimized for experiments on etiolated lentil seedlings), the preservation can take place
automatically when the samples are still under a controlled environment and a selected gravity level. A
modiﬁed version of the GRAVI-2 hardware are being developed to ﬂy the Plant Development

"
"13","Plants 2015, 4 56
experiment that will allow optimal growth ofArabidopsis thaliana seedlings under light conditions with
preservation in e.g., RNAlater under a controlled environment [53]. When testing the preservation
protocol for the MULTIGEN—2 experiment (ﬁnally included as part of the Plant Development experiment),
the RNA quality and quantity was satisfactory for microarray analysis [66]. However, among the genes
induced in the RNAlater preserved samples, three salt inducible transcription factors (ZATl 0, SZF 1 , and
SZF2) were identiﬁed, suggesting that the high salt concentration in RNAlater causes salt stress before the
transcription has stopped. The results (10 indicate that not all the biological processes are stopped
instantly by the RNAlater, and ﬁthher optimization of the preservation protocol will be performed.

The Random Positioning Machines (RPMs) and elinostats allow studies of simulated microgravity
effects on plants on the ground. A RPM consists of two planar frames that can be rotated independently
with random speeds and directions [67—69]. In several cases, it has been demonstrated that higher plants
grown on RPMs perform a similar growth and cellular response as under true microgravity conditions
for the parameters studied [24,68,70]. When exposing Arabidopsis thaliana seedlings on a RPM under
light conditions for 16 h the results demonstrated a moderate to low regulation of 55 genes (<0.2% 0f
the analyzed genes; [71]). Most of the differentially expressed genes could be linked to either a stress or
light response. The AtEXP8 was among the significantly repressed genes, and this gene encodes an
eXpansin with a known eell-wall loosening function in plants [72] linked to auxin and both photo- and
gravitropic growth responses [73]. Gene expression analyses on a DNA chip have been carried out on 6 day
old plants using a 3-D elinostat in two experiments, the ﬁrst lasting for 1 h and the second for 6 days [74].
Both the 1 h and the 6-day-long exposures showed a differential expression of a relatively large number
of genes (400 and 500 genes, respectively). Among the induced genes were Ext (At3g244890) that has
been linked to cell wall modifications and plant tip growth [75]. This gene was shown to be induced
after a 1 h exposure to simulated microgravity, but not after a 24, 96 or 144 h exposure. This indicated
an early response for redistribution/reformation 0f the composition in the cell wall structures [74]. In the
same study, the XTR6 (At4g25 810) gene was found to be signiﬁcantly induced, especially after 24 h.
The XTR6 correlates with plant cell expansion/elongation by decorating cellulose micro fibrils and
forming eross-links between them [76].

13. Conclusions

The results obtained from the ground-based studies and space experiments have supported the
hypothesis that plants increase the rigidity of their cell walls Via modifications to the metabolism of cell
wall constituents in gravity resistance. Because the type of plant materials used in space experiments is
limited, the universality of this hypothesis needs to be conﬁrmed in further space experiments. In
addition, the roles of the symplast and the plasma membrane sustaining the functions of the cell wall
remain to be clariﬁed.

The earliest space experiments using rapeseed protoplasts exposed for micro-g conditions for 14 days
on Biokosmos 9 demonstrated a significant decrease in the content of cellulose and hemicellulose. From
the protoplasts retrieved after ﬂight, the callus cultures established showed a retarded growth and
division compared to the ground control, and the tissue cultures were not able to differentiate into mature
plants. Both the IML-l and the S/MM-03 experiments also using protoplasts confirmed some of the
results obtained in Biokosmos 9; after 8—11 days of micro-g conditions the regeneration of the rapeseed

"
"14","Plants 2015, 4 57
protoplasts was retarded and mature plants did not develop from the retrieved oalli obtained from the
ﬂight samples. The space ﬂight protoplast experiments have shown that the critical step in the
regeneration of the protoplast into an intact cell is the immediate reconstitution of the cell wall. CMTs
are believed to orient the nascent cellulose miorofibrils in the regenerating cell, and apparently the
amount of the CMTs is anticipated to affect both the cellulose incorporation and the division capacity in
cell cultures.

The results from the performed space experiments, including the few focusing on cell walls, are
difﬁcult to interpret and often inconclusive due to the use of various ﬂight hardware, growth conditions,
preservations, the small number of experiments, and few replicates. Future space experiments should
therefore have standardized conditions e.g., for plant growth [77,78]. Whenever possible, the preservation
for gene expression analyses should take place under environmentally controlled conditions. For the “omio
data” (e.g., genomics and proteomios), a general database should be developed [77] giVing the science
community access to these limited and exclusive space experiment datasets.

Cell wall molecular mechanisms that are well established on Earth (e.g., cell wall loosening and
selective cell wall rearrangement mechanism) are important candidates for space experiments.
