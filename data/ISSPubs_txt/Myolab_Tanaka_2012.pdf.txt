Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is an incurable and fatal neurodegenerative disease characterized by the

expression was substantial in the sera of sporadic ALS patients than that of other diseased patients. This
study suggests that GPNMB can be a target for therapeutic intervention for suppressing motor neuron
degeneration in ALS.
myotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), also known as Lou Gehrig disease, is a devastating adult-onset neu-
A rodegenerative disease characterized by progressive muscular paralysis reﬂecting the degeneration of
motor neurons and causing death within 3—5 years of diagnosisl. Approximately 10% of ALS cases are
genetically inherited, whereas the remaining 90% have no clear genetic causez. Several ALS-linked genes have
been identiﬁed, including SOD] (encoding superoxide dismutase 1), TARDBP (encoding TAR DNA binding
protein-43), FUS/TLS (encoding RNA-binding protein FUS), and others3. Furthermore, new models based on
these genes have been established during recent years, improving the understanding of ALS pathogenesis3’4.
Despite enormous research efforts, however, a mechanistic understanding of the neurodegenerative disease
processes in vivo is still largely lacking, and no effective treatments to halt the progression of ALS have yet been
developed.

Gene expression profiling studies using microarrays have been conducted on various tissues from rodent
models for ALS”, cell cultures9, and postmortem ALS central nervous system tissueslo‘15 to identify new disease-
relevant genes and targets for therapeutic intervention in ALS, and many novel genes involved in the disease
pathogenesis have been identified. Furthermore, these studies have highlighted many key issues pertaining to
microarray analysis in ALS, such as differences in (i) animal models and human cohorts, (ii) familial and sporadic
ALS (SALS), (iii) tissue collection points at the presymptomatic or symptomatic stages, and (iv) cell speciﬁcity.
Consequently, the results of genome-wide screening have tended not to reﬂect the development of a scientiﬁc and
rational approach for ALS treatment owing to poor reproducibility. Indeed, only ~5% of the genome is overlap in
the same direction in more than one study”.

By microarray analysis, we identified glycoprotein nonmetastatic melanoma B (GPNMB) as a novel ALS-
related factor from the spinal cords of mutant superoxide dismutase (SOD1G93A) mice. GPNMB is a type I
transmembrane protein that is also known as Osteoactivin, Dendritic Cell—Heparin Integrin Ligand or
