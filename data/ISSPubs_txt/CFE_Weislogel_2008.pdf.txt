A scaling of the tWO—dimensional Laplacian operator is demonstrated for certain solutions (at least)
to Poisson’s equation. It succeeds by treating the operator as a single geometric scale entity. The
belated and rather subtle method provides an efﬁcient assessment of the geometrical dependence of
the problem and is preferred When practicable to the hydraulic diameter or term—by—term scaling for
slender fully developed laminar ﬂows. The improved accuracy further reduces the reliance of
problems on Widely varying numerical data or cumbersome theoretical forms and improves the
prospects of exact 0r approximate theoretical analysis. Simple example problems are brieﬂy
described that demonstrate the application and potential of the method. © 2008 American Institute
