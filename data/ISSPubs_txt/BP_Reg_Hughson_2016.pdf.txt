Elevated End-Tldal Pco2 During Long-Duratlon
Spaceﬂ lg ht
Richard L. Hughson; Nicholas J.Yee; Danielle K. Greaves
BACKGROUND: Elevated ambient Pco2 in the International Space Station (ISS) has been cited as a potential contributor to the vision
impairment intracranial pressure syndrome (VIIP), a signiﬁcant health risk for astronauts during Iong-duration space
missions. The elevation in ambient Pco2 is rather modest and normal respiratory compensation could minimize the
impact on arterial PC02.
METHODS: In nine male astronauts, breaths measured prior to a rebreathing maneuver were examined to assess inspired and
end-tidal Pco2 during upright seated preﬂight and in-ﬂight conditions.
RESULTS: Inspired Pco2 increased from preﬂight baseline (0.6 i 0.1 mmHg) to in ﬂight (3.8 i 0.4 mmHg). End-tidal Pco2 also
increased from preﬂight baseline (36.0 i 3.2 mmHg) to in ﬂight (42.1 i 3.7 mmHg).The difference between end-tidal
Pco2 comparing in ﬂight to preﬂight (6.1 i 1.6 mmHg) was greater than the difference between inspired Pco2 compar-
ing preﬂight to in ﬂight (3.3 i 0.5 mmHg).

DISCUSSION: The greater increase in end-tidal vs. inspired Pco2 might reﬂect alveolar hypoventilation due to differences in ventilatory
control with spaceﬂight.These data suggest that further studies should focus on arterial PC02 and acid-base balance to
determine if CO2 dilates cerebral and retinal vessels and might contribute to the incidence ofVIIP in astronauts.

KEYWORDS: astronaut, respiratory control, arterial PC02, vision impairment intracranial pressure syndrome.
