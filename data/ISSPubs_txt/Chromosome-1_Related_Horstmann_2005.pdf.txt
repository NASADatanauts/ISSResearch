We measured the induction of structural aberrations in human chromosome 5 induced by iron ions using the novel technique of
multicolor banding in situ hybridization (mBAND). Human lymphocytes isolated from whole blood were exposed in vitro to
500 MeV/n (LET : 200 keV/ttm, doses 1 0r 4 Gy) Fe nuclei at the HIMAC accelerator in Chiba (Japan). Chromosomes were pre-
maturely condensed by calyculin A after 48 h in culture and slides were painted by mBAND. We found a frequency of 0.11 and 0.57
residual breakpoints per chromosome 5 after 1 and 4 Gy Fe-ions, respectively. 1nter—chromosomal exchanges were the prevalent
aberration type measured at both doses, followed by terminal deletions, and by intra~chromosomal exchanges. Among intra-chro-
mosomal exchanges, intra-arm events were more frequent than inter-arm, but a signiﬁcant number of intra-changes was associated
to inter-changes involving the same chromosome after 4 Gy of iron ions. '1‘hese events show that the complexity of chromosomal
exchanges induced by heavy ions can be higher than expected by previous FESH studies.
