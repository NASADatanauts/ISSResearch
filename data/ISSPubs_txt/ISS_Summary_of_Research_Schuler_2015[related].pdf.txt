During evolution, plants have developed mechanisms to adapt to a variety of
environmental stresses, ihcludihg drought, high salihity, Changes in carbon dioxide levels
and pathogens. Central sighalihg hubs and pathways that are regulated in response
to these stimuli have been identified. In contrast to these well studied environmental
stimuli, changes in transcript, protein and metabolite levels in response to a gravitational
stimulus are less well understood. Amyloplasts, localized in statocytes of the root tip,
in mesophyll cells of coleoptiles and in the elongation zone of the growing ihterhodes
comprise statoliths in higher plants. Deviations of the statocytes with respect to the
earthly gravity vector lead to a displacement of statoliths relative to the cell due to
their ihertia and thus to gravity perception. Downstream signaling events, including
