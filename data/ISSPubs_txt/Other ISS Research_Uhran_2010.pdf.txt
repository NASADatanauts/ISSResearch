Abstract
The completed International Space Station (ISS) is among the greatest ofinternational
cooperative endeavors in the history of science and technology. While the design, as-
sembly and operations to date are remarkable human achievements in their own right,
the opening of the utilization era over the next decade presents unprecedented oppor-
tunities for advancing research and development of space resources. NASA has been
working with international partners in Canada, Europe, Japan and Russia, as well as
the US. White House and Congress to maximize the value of this extraordinary global
asset. Scientific, technological and industrial uses are being enabled through new ini-
tiatives that are designed to contribute to both the future of space exploration and the
missions of organizations other than space agencies in the domains ofpublic health,
energy, the environment and education. International humanitarian projects are on
the drawing boards, as is a US. independent non-proﬁt foundation for the advance-
ment of scientific research into the realm of applied products and services. During the
next 12-18 months, the ISS will be strategically positioned to best support success in
these initiatives and unequivocally demonstrate the benefits of international coopera-
tion for peaceful purposes and value-added applications. A new global economy in
space is approaching the tipping point.
