Increased on landlng day. Addltlonally, durlng the stand test 6days after landlng,
parasympathetic modulation remained suppressed and heart rate remained elevated
compared to preﬂight levels. Heart rate and autonomic activity were not different from
preﬂight levels 30 days after landing. We detected changes in heart rate and autonomic
activity during a 3—min stand and a variety of functional tasks, where cardiovascular
deconditioning was still evident 6 days after returning from short—duration spaceﬂight.
The delayed recovery times for heart rate and parasympathetic modulation indicate the
necessity of assessing functional performance after long—duration spaceﬂight to ensure
crew health and safety.
