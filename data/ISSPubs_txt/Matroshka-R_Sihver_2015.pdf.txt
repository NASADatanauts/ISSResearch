pixel detector TimepiX. Outside the Earth’s protective atmosphere and magnetosphere, the environment is much harsher than at 8
aviation altitudes. In addition to the exposure to high energetic ionising cosmic radiation, there are microgravity, lack of atmos- é

solar ﬂares, exposures of spacecraft crews may even be lethal. In this paper, long-term measurements of the radiation environ- 0%
