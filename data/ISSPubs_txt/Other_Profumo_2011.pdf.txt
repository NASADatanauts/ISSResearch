"2","I. INTRODUCTION

Indirect dark matter detection is the search for the annihilation 0r decay products of
particle dark matter — instead of directly detecting the dark matter, indirect detection
aims at pinpointing the n0n—standard origin of a cosmiC—ray or a gainina—ray signal based
upon the messenger’s spectral 0r angular features (see the relevant Chapters of Ref. fer a
collection of recent reviews). Examples of indirect detection With gamma rays are searches
for a peculiar gamma—ray signal from nearby dwarf spheroidal galaxies (see e.g. I), from
nearby Clusters (e.g. II), from the center of the Galaxy (e.g. [5]), in the extragalaetie
gamma—ray background (e.g. l) or in the diffuse background angular distribution (e.g.
El); high—energy neutrinos from the center 0r 0f the Sun 0r 0f the Earth (see e.g. n), the
search for features in the spectrum of positrons 0r antiprotons (e.g. l), and the search for
antidetuerons (e.g. .) are further examples of indirect dark matter detection Channels.

This is an especially exciting point in time for the ﬁeld of indirect dark matter detection.
The Fermi Large Area Telescope (LAT) is well into its third, successful year Of science
Operations. Crucial aspects of the gamma—ray sky for indirect dark matter searches, such as
the issue of the galactic and extra—galaetie diffuse background, are undergoing Close scrutiny
With signiﬁcant progress well under—way -. Research and development is also in
progress for the next generation gamma—ray detector, a ground—based Cherenkev Telescope
Array (CTA), Whose signiﬁcantly lower IOW—energy threshold Will enormously beneﬁt its use
for dark matter searches. The IeeCube neutrino telescope has recently been completed,
With a thiekly—instruinented portion (DeepCore) that makes it an even better dark matter
detection instrument than originally designed -. Finally, the AMS—OZ payload has recently
been successfully deployed 0n—b0ard the International Space Station, and science results Will
soon be delivered.

The weakly—interaeting massive particle (WIMP) paradigm for the nature of dark matter
is a highly compelling scenario, as it relies on generic weak—seale physics and on the well—
knewn thermal freeze—out mechanism for the production of a relic With just the right density
to match the inferred dark matter abundance in the universe. However, the so—Called WIMP
miracle does not provide an explanation to Why the universal density of baryons QB (in units
of the critical density, QB E pB /pcrit) is tantalizingly Close to the density of dark matter QDM,
so much as to pose the veritable “coincidence problem” of explaining Why QDM/QB N 5.

2

"
"3","A general Class Of models posits that the dark matter relic density is in fact set by an
asymmetry between dark matter and anti—dark matter particles, in full similarity to the
baryonie relic density (e.g. ll.) If the two asymmetries are related to each other (for
example if there exists a “transfer mechanism” between the dark matter and the baryonie
sector), then generically mDM % c (QDM/QB)mp % 5 GeV, with mp the proton mass and C
a model—dependent number of order unity. These models have been dubbed “asymmetric
dark matter” models in Ref. -, and received a considerable amount of attention recently,
in part because of direct detection results that might point to a light (with a mass of a few
GeV) dark matter candidate.

While asymmetric dark matter models give rise to an interesting phenomenology (see
e.g. I), including new contributions to proton decay, and, as mentioned, can even
explain anomalies in direct dark matter experiments (e.g. l), by deﬁnition, asymmetric
dark matter does not annihilate (or does so at a very suppressed rate, should there be a
left—Over symmetric component). One might thus naturally wonder whether indirect dark
matter detection is or not entirely doomed in asymmetric dark matter scenarios (see however
I.)-

In this paper we consider a process that was, in an entirely different astrophysical setting,
suggested some time ago by Bloom and Wells -. There, the Authors suggested that high—
energy electrons in the jets of active galactic nuclei (AGN) could up—seatter dark matter
particles, possibly radiating a photon in the ﬁnal state. Estimating, with the techniques of
effective ﬁeld theory, the relevant cross section, and estimating the ﬂux of electrons and the
density of dark matter particles, the authors concluded that (1) the level of the signal was
several orders of magnitude below the sensitivity of the LAT, and (2) no speciﬁc “smoking—
gun” spectral features were present in the signal.

In Ref. we recently studied the same process originally proposed in -, improving
on the previous analysis in a number of ways. First, we carried out the complete elementary
process calculation, including resonance and threshold effects, for two particle dark matter
models (supersyininetrie neutralinos and the lightest Kaluza—Klein of universal extra dimen—
sions) for both cosmiC—ray electrons and protons in the AGN jet; Second, we re—evaluated
the AGN jet components and the dark matter density in View Of recent Observational and
theoretical—inodeling results. We concluded that the process can be resonant, and that the
resonance entails 0n the one hand a larger ﬁnal—state photon ﬂux, and on the other hand

3

"
"4","a distinctive spectral feature, corresponding to a certain, well—understood kinematic condi—
tion. As a result, we predicted that for some dark matter models the process of dark matter
scattering off of AGN jet particles can be observable by the Fermi LAT.

Here, we observe that our own Galaxy is populated by cosmic rays (hadrons and heavy
nuclei, electrons, positrons and neutrinos) that might interact with the Galactic dark matter
— a process that might be “Visible” with a gamma—ray telescope such as Fermi LAT if it
radiates a photon in the ﬁnal state. Evidently, the elementary processes we considered in
detail in Ref. are precisely the same for the ease of scattering off of Galactic cosmic
rays (albeit a few technical differences will be of importance, as we point out later). A
further possibility, that we leave for future work, is that dark matter—oosmio ray scattering
lead to inelastic processes producing e.g. neutral pious, eventually resulting in gamma rays.
Note that inelastic interactions between oosmio—ray protons and dark matter particles have
been also recently considered in Ref. and as a possible explanation to the origin
of the observed “knee” in the spectrum of galactic cosmic rays, for dark matter models
in the context of extra dimensions with a low fundamental scale of gravity. Limits on
the interaction cross section of dark matter off of hadronio cosmic rays have also been
considered in Ref. in the context of models of strongly interacting dark matter; the
strongest constraints were found to arise from effects on the predicted abundances of light
elements in big bang nueleosynthesis.

In this study we ﬁrst consider, in See. the process of dark matter scattering off of cosmic
rays in the Galaxy for a generic WIMP model, and we compare the expected luminosity
from ﬁnal—state radiated photons with what expected for WIMP pair—annihilation; we also
consider the same process for two additional dark matter models that received some attention
recently: dipolar dark matter and “luminous” dark matter. We then present the core of our
numerical results in See. and separately give details for the ease of oosmio—ray electrons
and protons -. We present a discussion and our conclusions in the ﬁnal Sec.
II. DARK MATTER PAIR ANNIHILATION VERSUS COSMIC RAY—DARK
MATTER SCATTERING

In this Section we estimate, for generic WIMP models as well as for dipolar and luminous
dark matter models, the expected luminosity for the process where a photon is emitted in

"5","the ﬁnal state of a cosmiC—ray scattering Off Of dark matter.

We start by comparing, for the case Of (symmetric) WIMP dark matter models where
pair—annihilatien can occur, the luminosity of the ﬁnal—state photon emission from cosmic
ray scattering Off Of dark matter to the well—known dark matter pair—annihilatien rate. Beth
processes can be thought of as occurring on the same target particles: Galactic dark matter.
We thus construct an order—Of—magnitude estimate for the relevant rates, per unit target.
These are deﬁned here as follows:

qexam N 10—38 g —> (few) x 10—34 g
This calculation only employs the local dark matter density and oosmio—ray electron ﬂux:
both these quantities are larger the Closer one gets to the center of the Galaxy. This order of
magnitude estimate, however, implies that in the generic case where the dark matter pair—
annihilates and there are no symmetries or kinematic effects suppressing the natural pair—
annihilation rate for a weak—soale weakly—interaoting particle, the effect under investigation
here is suppressed by 3 to 7 orders of magnitude compared to pair—annihilation. Notioe also
that the number of photons produced in each annihilation event is typically on the order
of 10—100, as opposed to the single photon that scattering off of cosmic ray would produce
1967’ event (an exception to this is given by inelastic processes leading to neutral pions in the
ﬁnal state). Since the detectable quantity here is not the event—rate, but the actual gamma
rays produced in the interactions, the suppression in the predicted gamma—ray ﬂux is thus
generically larger by a further 1 to 2 orders of magnitude.

If, however, effects such as oo—annihilation or velocity dependence of the pair—annihilation
are in place, the two processes could produce a comparable ﬂux of gamma rays. In addition,
if dark matter cannot pair—annihilate because of discrete symmetries or because of lack of
annihilation partners, such as in asymmetric dark matter models I, then scattering off of
cosmic ray electrons With a ﬁnal—state photon emission might be one, if not the only way to
detect a signal from dark matter With gamma—ray telescopes.

It is interesting to investigate two more dark matter scenarios that have received some
attention recently: dipolar dark matter (see e.g. _), and luminous dark matter -. The
former arises as dark baryons in hidden—seotor gauge mediation supersymmetry breaking
(see e.g. l), or in technicolor models (see e.g. n) While the relio density of this
Class of dark matter candidates is produced non—thermally, often a mechanism relates the
dark baryon to the Standard—Model baryon density, thereby providing an explanation to

interesting proposal in light of recent direct detection results -.

Notice that the effective target number density is likely over—estimated in Eq. ', as one
should really only consider dark matter particles within the diffusion region where Galactic
cosmic rays are conﬁned.

One can also compare our estimate in Eq. with the luminosity that would be produced
by sterile neutrinos with a lifetime 7' N 1031 s and a mass of a few keV, which lie at the verge
of the sensitivity of current X—ray data (see e.g. I.) This case is relevant here since sterile
neutrinos at that mass would produce exactly the same X—ray feature, a monochromatic line
at an energy of a few keV. We estimate that the corresponding Milky Way X—ray luminosity
would be on the order of

We thus infer that the luminosity we estimate for luminous dark matter excitation from
oosmio—ray scattering, Eq. ', is well below the current X—ray telescope sensitivity.

In what follows, we shall focus on the case of WlMPs, motivated by the estimates above,
and by the fact that if resonances are present, those can produce interesting and potentially
revealing spectral features, such as those we found in the case of scattering of dark matter
off of AGN jet cosmic rays -.

neutralino—proton cross section with the radiation of a photon in the ﬁnal state to calcu—

the ﬁnal electron. We relax here, however, that assumption, While still only considering

incoming direction, thus we want to keep the full kinematics unconstrained, and we integrate
over the full solid angle. In doing so, we encounter two distinct logarithmic enhancements:
(i) when the photon is collinear with the ﬁnal electron, as in l, and (ii) when the photon
is collinear with the initial electron. Notice that this integration is numerically non—trivial,
as it runs over ﬁve independent variables, which can be taken to be the photon angle {27, the
direction of the ﬁnal state electron, and the energy of the initial state electron. We adopt
here a Monte Carlo global adaptive integration strategy, as implemented in the Mathematica
package.

We show our numerical results in Fig. where we employ, for the sake of illustration,
10w lightest—neutralino Inasses (10 and 50 GeV) and small separations between the mass
of the lightest selectron and the lightest neutralino (0.5 and 1 GeV). The mass difference
sets the location Of the kinematic condition that corresponds to the end of possible resonant
effects. As a result, we ﬁnd a sharp cutoff at 0.5 (black line) and at 1 GeV (red and green
lines). Notice that the drop—Off is of about one order of magnitude. Also, notice that the

11

"
"12","spectrum is signiﬁcantly harder at energies below the kinematic drop—off, where it is slightly
harder than E7”. In principle, this might make this particular process distinguishable from
the diffuse galactic background. Also, from the standpoint of the angular distribution, this
process is not isotropic, as the corresponding intensity correlates with the product of the
oosrnio—ray density times the dark matter density. Finally, we note that the level of intensity
we predict for the signal for the models under consideration is only 3—4 orders of magnitude
smaller than the isotropic diffuse background -.

While a full—soale simulation of the detectability with Fermi LAT of the signal we eal—
oulated here is beyond the scope of the present analysis, we argue that the level of the
gamma—ray einission predicted e.g. in the models illustrated in ﬁg. might be potentially
detectable. At a gainina—ray energy of around 1 GeV, in the same units as in ﬁg. the ex—
tragalaotio diffuse emission is at the level of % few x 10—4, and has a very regular power—law
spectrum -. Considering an angular region of interest of 1 sr, the LAT effective area of
m 104 cm2 at 1 GeV -, and an observing time of 3 years, T N 108 s, this corresponds to a
total number of isotropic background photons collected at energies around 1 GeV on the or—
der of 105, and a total number of signal events (for e.g. the red line model of ﬁg. of around
102. This would correspond to a relatively low signal—to—noise (for example, N s / \/N—B ~03),
but in principle an excess corresponding to the sharp spectral feature we predict here could
be detectable with Fermi LAT. A further handle would be to correlate the detected, albeit
with low statistical signiﬁcance, bump with its angular distribution, that should trace the
product of the dark matter tiines galactic oosrnio—ray density.

the integrals over a: and Eq can be done separately.

As we see in Table the normalization for the oosmio—ay proton ﬂux is two orders
of magnitude higher than the one for electrons. Naively, one might thus hope to get a
higher photon signal, but this is not actually the ease. The coupling constants enter the
cross section as a?) R, and because of the fractional electric Charge of the quarks, almost two
orders of magnitude are lost there. This is of course only a simple model—dependent accident.
The further integration over the PDFs, however, also suppresses the signal, because having
partons at a given energy requires having much larger proton energies, and the spectrum of
oosrnio—ray protons falls very steeply With energy. As a result, we ﬁnd that the photon ﬂux
coming from proton scattering ends up being comparable to the ﬂux from electron scattering
for the particular case of supersyininetrio dark matter.

Using again for illustrative purposes the ease of supersyininetry, we Choose three

smeared out over a broader range of photon energies, but is still noticeable. The overall
normalization is still in a range which is, for some models, within 3—4 orders of magnitude
of the isotropic gamma—ray background.

Notice that we ﬁnd for the proton case a kinematieal condition on the minimum quark

from which we see that the ﬁnal photon energy cannot exceed Mx/ (1 —COS 67). That explains,
for example, the sudden drop to zero at around 5 GeV for the line with MX : 10 GeV in
Fig.

IV. DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSIONS

We studied the process of Galactic cosmiC—ray electron and proton scattering Off Of dark
matter with the emission of a photon in the ﬁnal state. We argued that the gamma—ray
ﬂux from this process is, for WIMP models, suppressed compared to gamma rays from dark
matter pair—annihilatien. However, if the latter is in turn suppressed, or nonexistent as
in asymmetric dark matter models, cosmiC—ray—dark matter scattering can Offer a unique
Opportunity for indirect dark matter searches with gamma rays. We ﬁnd that, while for
dipolar and luminous dark matter the intensity of the signal is well below detectability, for
WIMP models resonances can enhance the signal to a detectable level in principle.

We illustrated the expected photon spectrum for the particular case Of supersymmetrie
dark matter, and for a few particle dark matter and selectren/squark masses. We found
that the resonant structure entails a sharp spectral drop—Off, at energies corresponding to the
mass difference between the selectron/squark and the lightest neutralino. The spectrum is
harder than E ‘2 below the cutoff, and softer, and much more suppressed, at higher energies.
In conclusion, while this process might be sub—dominant with respect to traditional searches
for pair—annihilatien signatures, it might still Offer a unique Chance Of detecting indirectly
dark matter with gamma—ray telescopes.
