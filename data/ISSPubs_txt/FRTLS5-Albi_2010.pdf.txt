Abstract
Prolonged spaceﬂights are known to elicit changes in human cardiovascular, musculoskeletal, and nervous
systems, whose functions are regulated by the thyroid gland. It is known that sphingornyelin metabolism is
involved in apoptosis (programmed cell death) of thyroid cells induced by UVC radiation, but at present no data
exists with regard to this phenomenon, which occurs during space missions. The aim of this study was to
analyze, for the first time, the effect of spaceﬂight on the enzymes of sphingornyelin metabolism, sphingo-
myelinase, and sphingornyelin synthase, and to determine whether the ratio between the two enzymes might be
used as a possible marker for thyroid activity during space missions. Both quiescent thyroid cells and thyroid
cells stimulated to proliferate with thyrotropin (TSH) were cultured during the Eneide and Esperia missions on
the International Space Station. The results show that during space missions the cells treated with TSH grew
only 1.5 i 0.65—fold and, thus, behave similarly to quiescent cells, while on the ground the same cells, main-
tained in experimental conditions that reproduced those of the ﬂight, grew 7.71 i 0.67—fold. Comparison of the
sphingornyelinase/sphingornyelin-synthase ratio and the levels of Bax, STATS, and RNA polymerase II in
proliferating, quiescent, pro-apoptotic, or apoptotic cells demonstrated that thyroid cells during space missions
were induced into a pro-apoptotic state. Given its specificity and the small amount of cells needed for analysis,
we propose the use of the sphingornyelinase/sphingornyelin-synthase ratio as a marker of functional status
of thyroid cells during space missions. Further studies could lead to its use in real time during prolonged
spaceﬂights. Key Words: Biosensors—Lipids—Nucleus—Space enVironment—Sphingornyelin—Thyroid cell.
