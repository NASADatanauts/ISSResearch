Plasma Cytoklne Concentrations Indicate
That In VIVO Hormonal Regulation of Immunity
Is Altered During Long-Duratlon Spaceflight

Aspects of immune system dysregulation associated with long—duration spaceﬂight have yet to be fully Charac—
terized and may represent a Clinical risk to crewmembers during deep space missions. Plasma cytokine concen—
tration may serve as an indicator of in viva physiological changes or immune system mobilization. The plasma
concentrations of 22 cytokines were monitored in 28 astronauts during long—duration spaceﬂight onboard the
International Space Station. Blood samples were collected 3 times before ﬂight, 3—5 times during ﬂight (depending
on mission duration), at landing, and 30 days after landing. Analysis was performed by bead array immunoassay.
With few exceptions, minimal detectable mean plasma concentrations were observed at baseline (launch minus
180) for innate inﬂammatory cytokines or adaptive regulatory cytokines; however, interleukin (IL)—1ra and several
chemokines and growth factors were constitutively present. An increase in the plasma concentration, tumor
necrosis factor—oc (TNFoc), IL—8, IL—lra, thrombopoietin (Tpo), vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), C—C
motif chemokine ligand 2 (CCL2), chemokine ligand 4/macr0phage inhibitory protein 1b (CCL4), and C—X—C
motif chemokine 5/epithelia1 neutrophil—activating protein 78 (CXCLS) was observed associated with spaceﬂight.
No signiﬁcant alterations were observed during or following spaceﬂight for the inﬂammatory or adaptive/T—
regulatory cytokines: IL—lot, IL—lB, IL—2, interferon—garnma (IFN—y), IL—17, IL—4, IL—5, IL—10, G—CSF, GM—CSF,
FGF basic, CCL3, 0r CCLS. This pattern of cytokine dysregulation suggests multiple physiological adaptations
persist during ﬂight, including inﬂammation, leukocyte recruitment, angiogenesis, and thrombocyte regulation.
