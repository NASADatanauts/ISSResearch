Gene expression changes in space. Genes Whose expression changes more than 3-fold in space are listed according to gene groups. For
comparison, changes during rotating wall vessel (RWV) culture in the same genes are also listed. The values shown represent balanced
differential gene expression. Gene expression is reported as the difference between the cyanine-3 ﬂuorescent signal in the control cDNA
sample and cyanine-5 signal on the experimental cDNA sample. The experimental cDNA sample is corrected for differences in total signal
strength based on internal controls on the gene chip. See Ref. 8a for description of IMAGE nos. (see also http://image.llnl.gov/).
