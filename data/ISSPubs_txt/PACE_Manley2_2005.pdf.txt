We present a uniﬁed framework for understanding the compaction of colloidal gels under their own
weight. The dynamics of the collapse are determined by the value of the gravitational stress 0g, as
compared to the yield stress 0'Y 0f the network. For 0g < 0y, gels collapse poroelastically, and their rate
of compression decays exponentially in time. For 0g > 0y, the network eventually yields, leading to rapid
settling. In both cases, the rate of collapse is backﬂow limited, while its overall magnitude is determined
by a balance between gravitational stress and network elastic stress.
