Abstract
The ALTEA project, an international and multi—disciplinary collaboration scheduled to ﬂy in the International Space Station
(ISS) after July 2006, is aimed at studying particle radiation in space environment and its effects on astronauts, in particular the
anomalous perception of “light ﬂashes’. In this paper, we present experimental results obtained by testing the Flight Model of
the ALTEA particle detector in two measurement sessions performed at the heavy ion accelerator of GSI laboratory in Darmstadt,
Germany. Instrument response was compared With M0nte—car10 simulations to study its linearity and calculate ampliﬁcation.
