Abstract
In the frame of the joint experiment BRADOS—l, absorbed dose and average linear energy transfer were assessed by means of
7LiF:Mg,Ti (TLD—700) thermoluminescence detectors for different panels onboard the Russian Segment of the International Space Sta—
tion in the timeframe between February and October 2001 (248 days). A technique is presented to correct the measured absorbed dose
values for thermoluminescent eﬂiciency in the radiation climate onboard the spacecraft. Average linear energy transfer is determined
from the high—temperature thermoluminescence emission in the TLD—700 glowcurve and used as a parameter in the thermolumines—
cent—eﬂiciency correction. Depending on the shielding distribution, the eﬂiciency—corrected absorbed dose varies between 168(2) tLGy/
d in panel N0. 318 (core block ceiling) and 249(4) tLGy/d in panel No. 443 (starboard—side commander cabin). The experimental data
are compared With model calculations using detailed shielding distributions and orbit parameters as input.
