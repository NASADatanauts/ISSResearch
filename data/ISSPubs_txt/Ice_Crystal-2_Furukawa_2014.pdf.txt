Abstract
Microgravity experiments for ice crystal growth were conducted twice in the J apan Experiment Module “Kibo” 0f the International Space
Station. Experimental cartridges newly developed for each experiment were transported to the space station and installed in the SCOF facility.
All of the experiments were possibly could be performed by using a tele-control system on the ground. Crystal patterns during free growth of
ice crystals in supercooled water were observed by using specially designed interference microscopes. Experiments were carried out for ice
crystal growth in supercooled pure water (D20) and in a supercooled solution (H20) 0f antifreeze glycoprotein. Based on analysis of moving
images, the pattern formation mechanism of ice dendrites in pure water and the ﬂuctuation mechanism of growth rates in protein solution are
discussed.
