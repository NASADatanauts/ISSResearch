g 24 Abstract
6
7 25 White spruce (Picea glauca [Moeneh] Voss) seedlings produced by somatic
8
18 26 embryogenesis were grown both at the Kennedy Space Center and in weightlessness in
11 . . .
12 27 the 188 for 30 days. Plants were placed 111 closed enV1r0nrnent meubators (Advanced
l3
14 28 Biological Research System) under controlled light, temperature, humidity and C02
15
i: 29 conditions. At the end of the experiment, the leading shoot from three plantlets of each 0f
18
19 30 the three lines tested were sampled and pooled in Kennedy Space Center F ixation Tubes
20
g: 31 (KFT) containing a RNA stabilization solution. Transcript levels were determined by
23
24 32 quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) for 27 candidate genes and
25
:3 33 three reference genes on the nine seedlings grown in each environment. About two-thirds
28
29 34 0f the 27 genes produced a larger number of transcript molecules in microgravity
3O
31 35 conditions. However, only three genes showed significant differences between the two
32
3: 36 environments, and all of them were up-regulated in microgravity. These genes appear to
35
36 37 be involved in important processes such as cell propagation, plant development and
37
3: 38 response to stress, and their up-regulation has likely contributed to inﬂuencing seedling
4O
41 39 growth patterns.

18 47 During their development, plants are inﬂuenced by diverse exogenous and endogenous
11 . . . . .
12 48 Slgnals that can either vary over time or be constant. GraV1ty 1S one of the few that do not
l3
14 49 vary during a plant’s lifetime (Valster and Blancaﬂor, 2008). Plants need to orient their
15
i: 50 various organs in order to access resources that allow them to survive and ultimately
l 8
1 9 51 reproduce. Hence, roots Will generally grow in the direction of the gravity vector, i.e.
2 0
g: 52 downwards, Where they find access to water and nutrients, Whereas the leader sheet will
2 3
2 4 53 be negatively gravitropic to have access to the light, moisture, oxygen and carbon dioxide
2 5
:3 54 required for photosynthesis.
2 8
2 9
3O 55 The gravitational response proceeds through four steps: 1) sensing the direction of gravity,
31
ii 56 2) converting this biophysical stimulus into a biochemical signal, 3) transmitting the latter
34
3 5 57 signal to the right tissues, and 4) the organ changing direction if needed (Tasaka et a1.,
3 6
3; 58 1999). In both roots and stems that change their orientation relative to the gravity vector,
3 9 . . .
4 0 59 the growth regulator auxm accumulates to higher levels towards the graV1ty vector on the
4 1
42 60 lower side of the affected organ (Friml and Palme, 2002; Perrin et a1., 2005). In roots,
4 3
4 4 . . . . . . . . .
4 5 61 auxm accumulation results 111 the loeahzed 1nh1b1t10n of cell eXpans10n and the
4 6
4 7 62 reorientation of growth towards the gravity vector. In stems, auxin accumulation has the
4 8
:8 63 opposite effect and stimulates cell expansion, Which causes the growth direction to
51 .
52 64 reorient away from the growth vector.
53
54
g: 65 TWO hypotheses have been proposed to explain how plants perceive the direction of
57
58 66 gravity. These are 1) the gravitational-pressure model and 2) the starch-statolith

g 67 hypothesis (Morita and Tasaka, 2004). The latter is now the most widely accepted as the
6
7 68 maj or gravity-sensing mechanism and states that staroh-aooumulating amyloplasts move
8
18 69 along the gravity vector within gravity-sensing cells (statooytes). This amyloplast
1 1 . . . .
12 70 movement would be an 1ntrloate process 1nvolV1ng vacuolar membrane structures and the
l 3
l 4 71 aotin oytoskeleton (Morita, 2010).
1 5
l 6
l 7 . . . .
1 8 72 When one wants to study the effect of graV1ty on plant growth, 1t 1s very dlfﬁeult to
l 9
:2 73 design an experiment in which the effects of gravity will be largely eliminated while
2 2 . . . .
2 3 74 oontrolhng any other factors that mlght also 1nﬂuenoe growth. The most effeotlve way to
2 4
25 75 reduce gravity effects on obj eots like plants is through the use of free fall (Correll and
2 6
g; 76 Kiss, 2008). Several devices can create simulated microgravity environments, but only a
2 9
3O 77 space infrastructure such as the International Space Station (188) can make it possible to
3 1
ii 78 study the effects of gravitropism on plants over a long period of time. While there are
3 4
3 5 79 scientiﬁc interests and potential economic benefits to better understanding how plants
3 6
3; 80 react to gravitational forces, any knowledge on adaptation of plants to the microgravity
39 . . . . . . .

4 1
42 82 space have included the idea that a closed ecological system is a necessity for long term
4 3
j: 83 life support at great distances from earth (Dempster, 1999). In such closed ecosystem
4 6
47 84 (Dempster et al., 2004), plants, and especially trees, would help capture C02, produce
4 8
:8 85 oxygen and provide a continuous supply of moisture in the air through evapotranspiration.
5 1
52 86 Presence of plants would also provide a positive psychological impact on humans living
53

12
13
l 4 331 The ABRS environmental conditions had to be adjusted during the experiment due to
15
i: 332 difﬁculties maintaining the conditions chosen. They were adjusted both on the ISS and at
l 8
1 9 333 KSC. Hence, the temperature was increased from 24°C to 25°C 10 days after the
2 0
g: 334 experiment begun. The carbon dioxide concentration set at 500 ppm could not be
2 3
24 335 maintained. Thus 5 days after the seedlings were put into the ABRS, carbon dioxide
2 5
:3 336 concentration was increased to 700 ppm, was maintained as such for 20 days, but was
2 8
2 9 337 increased to 1000 ppm for the last 5 days.
30
31
ii 338 Because water is free to go in any direction, management of water and humidity is a real
34
3 5 339 challenge in microgravity. As the ABRS is a closed environment, temperature tends to
3 6
3; 340 increase when 1i ghts are on, and the air in the incubator needs to be cooled down to
3 9
4 0 341 maintain the constant temperature required for the experiment. While the ABRS is
4 1
42 342 equipped with a system to remove moisture from the air and put it back into the root tray,
4 3
j: 343 some water nevertheless condenses 0n the ABRS walls and accumulates with time. T0

4 7 344 avoid any potential breakdown of the in-ﬂight incubator, the experiment rack was opened
4 8
:8 345 twice during the course of the experiment and the water that had accumulated 0n the
51
52 346 walls was wiped out. At the second opening of the incubator, 100 mL of water was added
53
g: 347 to the plants to replace the quantity of water that had been removed. While this
5 6
57 348 phenomenon is not observed on the ground, the incubator 0n the ground was also opened
58

g: 356 Tests were carried out using RT-qPCR to evaluate whether the determination of transcript

2 4 357 levels was affected by the lower than expected RNA quality. Three reference genes (efla,

2 8
2 9 359 The RT-qPCR cycle thresholds were slightly higher than previously observed for these
30
31 360 genes on higher quality RNA extracts (Bedon et a1., 2007, Boyle et a1., 2009) suggesting
32
3: 361 that the number of intact transcripts was slightly reduced. However, the different samples
35
3 6 362 produced very similar melting curves for each of the genes, suggesting that the apparent
37
3: 363 RNA degradation had not introduced signiﬁcant variation among the samples. Results of

2 4
25 467 interactions and found in 21 number of functionally different proteins (Blatch and L2iss1e,

4 0
4 1 473 been involved in re-establishing normal cellular homeostasis in plants (Atkinson and
42
j: 474 Urwin, 2012). Many of them are known to have diverse roles (Siddique et 211. 2008) and
4 5
4 6 475 to react not only to elevated temperature but also to other extreme conditions such as
4 7
:5; 476 water, salinity and osmotic, cold and oxidative stress (Waters et a1., 1996; Wang et a1.,
50 . .
51 477 2004; Sorensen et a1., 2003; Sun et a1., 2002). Numerous genes, 1nclud1ng heat shock

54

:2 487 The third gene showing significant up-regulation in microgravity is GQ03719_P07 (GB:
:2 488 BT116507). It is highly similar to the locus At5G22480 which is a ZPRl zino-finger
2 4
25 489 domain protein. ZPRl may have a signalling role as there is evidence that it accumulates
2 6
g; 490 in the nucleolus of proliferating cells and contributes to its normal function (Galoheva-
2 9
30 491 Gargova et al., 1998). Its transcript level is known to increase in response to activation of

i: 507 Conclusion
1 7
18 508 The analysis of gene expression in white spruce plants grown in a microgravity
l 9
:2 509 environment for a period of 30 days identiﬁed an impact that was small overall. Three out
22 . . . . . .
2 3 510 of the 27 candidate genes studied were s1gn1floantly up-regulated under spaceﬂight
2 4
25 511 conditions. These three genes appear to be involved in important processes such as cell
2 6
g; 512 propagation, plant development and response to stress. Tissues for the gene expression
2 9
30 513 study were conserved in a RNA stabilization solution (RNAlater). Unfortunately, this
3 1
ii 514 solution did not appear to have maintained, as expected, the integrity of RNA molecules.
3 4
3 5 515 The number of genes investigated in this study was limited owing to partial RNA
3 6
3; 516 degradation. The RNA was not suitable for transoriptorne-wide proﬁling using
3 9 . . . . .
4 0 517 microarrays desplte attempts to optlmlze the labellmg methods (not shown). In any
4 1
42 518 future experiments of this type involving trees, we recommend that another method of
4 3
j: 519 tissue conservation be used. Access to liquid nitrogen, which is ideal, is not possible on
4 6
47 520 the 188, but freezing samples as soon as possible after harvesting would likely be
4 8
:8 521 advantageous for maintaining RNA integrity. Finally, an in-ﬂight lxg control on a
5 1
52 522 centrifuge would also be useful to differentiate between effects of microgravity and other
53
g: 523 spaceﬂight environmental factors because the ground control cannot help estimate any
5 6
57 524 possible effects of the transport procedure to the 188.
