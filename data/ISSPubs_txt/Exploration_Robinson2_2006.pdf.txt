ABSTRACT
In response to the U.S. President’s Vision for Space Exploration (January 14, 2004), NASA has revised its
utilization plans for 188 to focus on (1) research on astronaut health and the development of countermeasures
that Will protect our crews from the space environment during long duration voyages, (2) 188 as a test bed for
research and technology developments that Will insure vehicle systems and operational practices are ready for
future exploration missions, (3) developing and validating operational practices and procedures for long-
duration space missions. In addition, NASA Will continue a small amount of fundamental research in life and
microgravity sciences. There have been signiﬁcant research accomplishments that are important for
achieving the Exploration Vision. Some of these have been formal research payloads, While others have come
from research based on the operation of International Space Station (188). We Will reVieW a selection of these
experiments and results, as well as outline some of ongoing and upcoming research. The 188 represents the
only microgravity opportunity to perform on-orbit long-duration studies of human health and performance and
technologies relevant for future long-duration missions planned during the next 25 years. Even as NASA
focuses on developing the Orion spacecraft and return to the moon (2015-2020), research on and operation of
the 188 is fundamental to the success of NASA’s Exploration Vision.
