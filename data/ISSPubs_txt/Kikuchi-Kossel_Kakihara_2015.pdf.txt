Abstract
We examined inﬂuences of the particle volume fraction ¢ and effective charge number Zeff on the crystal structures of charged colloids,
by means of the reﬂection spectroscopy and Kikuchi-Kossel diffraction measurements. We employed dilute salt-free aqueous dispersions of
charged polystyrene (PS) particles (the diameter d = 110 to 120 nm; Zeff = about 1300) and colloidal silica (d = 120 nm, Zeff = about 550).
The PS colloids had the BCC structure at ¢ S 0.01 and exhibited the structural phase transition into the FCC lattice on increasing ¢. The silica
colloids, which had lower Zeff, took the BCC structures at all ¢s examined (¢ S 0.04).
Keyword(s): charged colloidal crystal, BCC-FCC phase transition, reﬂection spectroscopy.
