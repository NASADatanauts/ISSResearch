Purpose: To describe the history, Clinical findings, and possible etiologies of ophthalmic findings discovered
in 7 astronauts after Iong-duration space flight, and document vision changes in approximately 300 additional
astronauts.

Design: Retrospective, observational examination of ophthalmic findings in 7 astronauts and analysis of
postflight questionnaires regarding in-flight vision Changes in approximately 300 additional astronauts.

Participants: Seven astronauts with ophthalmic anomalies upon return from Iong-duration space missions
to the International Space Station and 300 additional astronauts who completed postflight questionnaires
regarding in-flight vision Changes.

Methods: Before and after Iong-duration space flight, all 7 subjects underwent complete eye examinations,
including cycloplegio and/or manifest refraction and fundus photography. Six underwent postmission optical
coherence tomography (OCT) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI); 4 had lumbar punctures (LP). Approxi-
mately 300 astronauts were queried regarding visual Changes during space missions.

Main Outcome Measures: Refractive Change, fundus photograph examination, retina OCT, orbital MRI, LP
opening pressures, and examination of visual acuity data.

Results: After 6 months of space flight, 7 astronauts had ophthalmic findings, consisting of disc edema in
5, globe flattening in 5, choroidal folds in 5, cotton wool spots (CWS) in 3, nerve fiber layer thickening by OCT
in 6, and decreased near vision in 6 astronauts. Five of 7 with near vision complaints had a hyperopic
shift 2+0.50 diopters (D) between pre/postmission spherical equivalent refraction in 1 or both eyes (range, +0.50
to +1.75 D). These 5 showed globe flattening on MRI. Lumbar punctures performed in the 4 with disc edema
documented opening pressures of 22, 21, 28, and 28.5 cm H20 performed 60, 19, 12, and 57 days postmission,
respectively. The 300 postflight questionnaires documented that approximately 29% and 60% of astronauts on
short and Iong-duration missions, respectively, experienced a degradation in distant and near visual acuity.
Some of these vision Changes remain unresolved years after flight.

Conclusions: We hypothesize that the optic nerve and ocular Changes we describe may result from
cephalad fluid shifts brought about by prolonged microgravity exposure. The findings we report may represent
parts of a spectrum of ocular and cerebral responses to extended microgravity exposure.
