Abstract

An atomic oxygen ﬂuence monitor was ﬂown as part of the Materials International Space Station
Experiment—6 (MISSE—6). The monitor was designed to measure the accumulation of atomic oxygen
ﬂuence with time as it impinged upon the ram surface of the MISSE 6B Passive Experiment Container
(PEC). This was an active experiment for which data was to be stored on a battery-powered data logger
for post-ﬂight retrieval and analysis. The atomic oxygen ﬂuence measurement was accomplished by
allowing atomic oxygen to erode two opposing wedges of pyrolytic graphite that partially covered a
photodiode. As the wedges of pyrolytic graphite erode, the area of the photodiode that is illuminated by
the Sun increases. The short circuit current, which is proportional to the area of illumination, was to be
measured and recorded as a function of time. The short circuit current from a different photodiode, which
was oriented in the same direction and had an unobstructed View of the Sun, was also to be recorded as a
reference current. The ratio of the two separate recorded currents should bear a linear relationship with
the accumulated atomic oxygen ﬂuence and be independent of the intensity of solar illumination. Ground
hyperthermal atomic oxygen exposure facilities were used to evaluate the linearity of the ratio of short
circuit current to the atomic oxygen ﬂuence. In ﬂight, the current measurement circuitry failed to operate
properly, thus the overall atomic oxygen mission ﬂuence could only be estimated based on the physical
erosion of the pyrolytic graphite wedges. The atomic oxygen ﬂuence was calculated based on the
knowledge of the space atomic oxygen erosion yield of pyrolytic graphite measured from samples on the
MISSE 2. The atomic oxygen ﬂuence monitor, the expected result and comparison of mission atomic
oxygen ﬂuence based on the erosion of the pyrolytic graphite and Kapton H atomic oxygen ﬂuence
witness samples are presented in this paper.

1.0 Introduction

The ability to measure the atomic oxygen ﬂuence as a function of time as it impinges upon spacecraft
surfaces in low Earth orbit has been difﬁcult to achieve. Early deVices to measure atomic oxygen ﬂuence
consisted of thin ﬁlms silver or carbon coatings (often called thin ﬁlm actinometers) whose electrical
resistivity increased with time as the silver oxidized or the carbon was converted to gaseous
oxides(Refs. 1 to 3). Such thin ﬁlm deVices have limited ﬂuence measurement capability due to the
ﬁnite thickness of the thin ﬁlms. They also can give nonlinear responses as a function of ﬂuence.

The time variation of accumulation of atomic oxygen ﬂuence is also difﬁcult to predict based on end
point Kapton H weight loss measurements as a result of variations in solar activity, spacecraft altitude,
and spacecraft orientation. The prediction of atomic oxygen ﬂuence from orbital and spacecraft

"6","orientation data is also complicated by potential shielding of the ram facing surfaces. This is especially
true for complex distributed space structures such as the International Space Station. This paper describes
an atomic oxygen ﬂuence monitor that is based on the erosion yield of pyrolytie graphite from the
MISSE 2 mission (Ref. 4). It uses two 120 inclined wedges of graphite that are over grit blasted fused
silica Windows covering photodiodes. As the wedges erode a greater intensity of light illuminates the
photodiode. The short circuit current from the photodiode is compared to a reference photodiode also on
the MISSE 6B. The advantage of using wedges 0f pyrolytie graphite rather than using techniques
involving measuring the conductivity change of coatings of silver, carbon, or semiconductors is that the
ratio of the short circuit currents of the sample and reference is a signal that is linear With atomic oxygen
ﬂuence and also allows measurement of very high atomic oxygen ﬂuenees.
2.0 Apparatus and Procedure
The MISSE 6 atomic oxygen ﬂuence monitor was designed to allow 10W Earth orbital atomic oxygen
to erode pyrolytie graphite allowing sunlight to impinge on a fused silica Window that was grit blasted t0
diffusely scatter the sunlight Which then impinged upon a photodiode as shown in Figure 1. Figure 2
shows the conﬁguration of the pyrolytie graphite after atomic oxygen erosion.

The sharp wedge of pyrolytic graphite was made by attaching the pyrolytic graphite to a 120 wedge of
aluminum and sanding it on abrasive paper over a ﬂat surface. As shown in Figure 3.

The wedge angle 0f 120 was chosen as the smallest practical angle that the pyrolytic graphite could be
sanded to without resulting in very irregular sharpened ends resulting in the pyrolytic graphite. Because it
is not possible to atomically sharpen the pyrolytic graphite wedges using abrasion alone, there would be
an initial delay and lack of linearity in the photodiode current increase with ﬂuence until the graphite
wedges are atomically sharpened in LEO. To minimize the consequences of the less than perfect
mechanical sharpening, an additional sharpening step was performed using a hyperthermal atomic oxygen
beam from an end Hall atomic oxygen source operating on pure oxygen at 70 eV, shown in Figure 4. An
exploded View of the atomic oxygen ﬂuence sensor is shown in Figure 5.

Figure 6.—F|ight atomic oxygen fluence monitor and indium-tin oxide conductivity and transmittance experiment.

The ﬂuence monitor was assembled prior to the atomic oxygen sharpening, which is why the exposed
wedge portion appears black as a result of atomic oxygen texturing in the end Hall atomic oxygen beam
facility. The sharpening was performed to a Kapton H equivalent ﬂuence of 1.2><1022 atoms/cmz.

After the atomic oxygen sharpening the ﬂuence monitor was taken apart and reassembled to provide a
very small initial gap (0.0578 cm) in the pyrolytic graphite wedges prior to ﬂight. To be able to
discriminate between changes in photodiode current due to Sun angle variations and changes due to
erosion of the graphite wedges, an identical reference photodiode was used which had an View of the Sun
incidence upon an adj oining experiment. The short circuit current from the ﬂuence monitor photodiode
was then compared to this identical photodiode which also served as a reference Sun illumination
measurement on an adjoining indium—tin oxide conductivity and transmittance experiment. The ﬂight
atomic oxygen ﬂuence monitor and the reference photodiode from the indium—tin oxide conductivity and
transmittance experiment are shown in Figure 6.

"10","One of the merits of the design of the pyrolytic graphite atomic oxygen ﬂuenee monitor is that it
should have a reasonably linear output current With accumulated ﬂuenee and capable of sensing a high
ﬂuenee. To validate the high ﬂuenee linearity premise, an experiment was constructed using a lamp at a
large distance from the ﬂuence monitor along With a reference photodiode as shown in Figure 7. The
pyrolytic graphite gap was manually widened to allow measurement of the ratio of the ﬂuence monitor
current, I, to the reference current, 10, as a function of graphite gap, h, as shown in Figure 8. As can be
seen from Figure 8, the ﬂuence monitor has a reasonably linear response With a correlation coefﬁcient of
0.963 over a ﬂuence range Which represents at least 3.14><1022 atoms/em2 based on the erosion yield of
4.15><10'25 em3/at0ms. The scatter in the data points is thought to be due to the uncertainty in the setting
and measurement of the gap between the pyrolytic graphite wedges.

Figure 9.—Atomic oxygen fluence monitor measurement domain of 720 < CD < 180°.

Short circuit current measurements were to be recorded on a time interval of every 108 minutes. The
time interval between successive data points was purposely chosen to be slightly out of phase with the
91.2 minute average orbital period to insure that near normal solar illumination on the photodiodes, which
were oriented with their surface normal vectors facing tangential to the Earth’s surface and facing the ram
direction (see Fig. 9 where (l) = 90°), would frequently occur.

The data for near normal illumination could be corrected based on off—normal to normal short circuit
current calibrations for both the ﬂuence monitor and the reference photodiodes. The ground laboratory
calibration data for the ratio of measured to theoretical (based on sin CD) short circuit currents for the
ﬂuence monitor and the reference photodiodes is shown in Figures 10 and 11 respectively.

One would expect that the calibration data show a quicker loss in short circuit current with time after
6 am due to the fact that the active surface of the photodiodes is recessed within the photodiode enclosure.
This causes the Sun light to begin to miss the active surface of the photodiodes after 30 minutes past
midnight when the Sun is beginning to have an inclined angle of arrival on the photodiodes. The cover
glasses over the photodiodes were sandblasted to help moderate the effect of off—normal illumination
beginning to miss the active surface of the photodiodes.

The reference photodiode had similar output losses with off—normal illumination as the ﬂuence
monitor photodiode and for the same reasons.

Using the data from Figures 10 and 11, one can determine that data points taken between 20.3 and
25.3 minutes after midnight could be easily adjusted for off—normal output calibrations to be able to make
a long term plot of maximum short circuit current versus time to produce atomic oxygen ﬂuence data as a
function of time.

"13","3.0 Results and Discussion

The atomic oxygen ﬂuence monitor was attached to the International Space Station on the ram facing
surface of MISSE 6B passive experiment container (PEC) on March 13, 2008, as shown in Figure 12. The
experiment was retrieved on September 1, 2009. Although there were many periods of off normal atomic
oxygen incidence including periods in which the carrier was oriented in the ram direction, the atomic
oxygen ﬂuence was measured independently by Kapton H samples on the adjoining MISSE 6A PEC to
be approximately 1.97 i 0.05X1021at0ms/em2.

After examination of the data logger information it became apparent that the electronics had failed in
sending the short circuit current information from both the ﬂuence monitor and reference photodiodes.
Thus, the only measurement of ﬂuence that was obtainable from the experiment was from direct
measurement of the growth in the gap between the tips of the pyrolytie graphite wedges. Figure 13
compares photographs of the pre-ﬂight and post-ﬂight gaps in the pyrolytie graphite wedges. The before
and after ﬂight gaps in the pyrolytie graphite wedges were measured at 19 equally spaced locations along
the length of the gap by using digital calipers to measure close up photographs of the gap. The locations
of the gap measurements were identical for each measurement. To calibrate the photographs, the gap
between the aluminum plates that held down the pyrolytie graphite was measured in three identical
locations. It was assumed that the pyrolytie graphite wedges and aluminum hold down plates did not
move as a result of launch and retrieval Vibration. This was reasonable because the parts were all
machined to provide a tight ﬁt together and nested within each other.

Figure 13.—Comparison photographs of the pre-flight and post—flight gaps in the pyrolytic graphite wedges.

Substituting the change in gap (0.0054 cm) in Equation (2) and performing a propagation of errors
analysis of the measurement errors yields an atomic oxygen ﬂuence of 1.37 i0.16><1021atoms/om2.

Although the pyrolytic graphite wedges have straight edges on a macroscopic scale, they have rather
irregular edges on a microscopic scale. However, the wedges continue to retain a tapered sharp edge
which is limited in sharpness only by the microscopic cone-to-valley texture on the pyrolytic graphite
which is a result of the ram atomic oxygen erosion, as can be seen in Figure 14.

Based on the 9.2 percent growth in the gap between the ﬂuence monitor pyrolytic graphite wedges
and assuming a linear growth in accumulated ﬂuenoe with time, one would expect a resulting ﬂuenoe
versus time plot as shown in Figure 15.

However, the current measurement circuitry failed to operate properly and no useful data logger
information was retrievable from either the ﬂuence monitor or reference photodiodes. As a result, only
end points are available of the measurement in the gap in the pyrolytic graphite wedges as indicator of
total mission ﬂuenoe and no ﬂuenoe information as a function of time was possible to be measured. Based
on the many changes in the International Space Station orientation, if data was available one would
expect a very non-linear shape to the curve shown in Figure 15.

"16","It is interesting to note that the atomic oxygen ﬂuence monitor on PEC 6B predicted a lower ﬂuence
than from two Kapton H samples located nearby on PEC 6A even if one takes into account the
uncertainties as shown in Table I.

TABLE I.—MISSE 6 ATOMIC OXYGEN EROSION YIELDS
PEC Description Fluence, Uncertainty,

m

m

As can be seen from Table I, the ﬂuence measured by the atomic oxygen ﬂuence monitor was
~ 30 percent lower than the most accurate ﬂuence measured using a Kapton H sample from an adjoining
MISSE 6A PEC and ~32 percent lower than the ﬂuence measured by Kapton HN on the MISSE 6B PEC.
Explanations for the differences between measurements of atomic oxygen ﬂuence are somewhat
speculative. For the ﬂuence difference between to be accounted for by differences in thermal expansion,
the temperature of the experiment when photographed after the ﬂight would have to have been ~20 OC
lower than for the preﬂight photograph. This does not seem to be a good explanation because both
photographs were taken at room temperature in a controlled ofﬁce environment. Another possible
explanation could be that is possible shadowing from International Space Station Structures might have
produced a lower atomic oxygen ﬂuence on PEC 6B than on 6A. Another explanation considered is
relates to the atomic erosion yield of pyrolytic graphite wedges at 120 incline from the graphite basal
planes. If the erosion yield was lower as a result of the inclined surface it would contribute to a reduced
apparent ﬂuence. However, the amount of the reduction required appears too large to be caused by only a
120 incline. The most reasonable explanation appears to be small changes in the pyrolytic graphite gap
due either to launch or landing Vibration or thermal cycling caused gap shrinkage in space. The aluminum
(type 6061-T6) experiment base has a high thermal expansion coefﬁcient and the pyrolytic graphite and
has a near zero thermal expansion coefﬁcient. If one or both of the pyrolytic graphite wedges slipped
together by only 0.0012 cm (0.00049 in.) then the apparent loss in ﬂuence could be accounted for. If the
experiment ﬂew with active recording of the data this error would not eXist because there would be
negligible Vibration over the in-space mission duration.

4.0 Summary

An atomic oxygen ﬂuence monitor, ﬂown as part of the MISSE 6B, was designed to measure the
accumulation of atomic oxygen ﬂuence with time as it impinged upon the ram surface of the MISSE 6B.
This was an active experiment for which data was to be stored on a battery-powered data logger for post-
ﬂight retrieval and analysis. The atomic oxygen ﬂuence measurement was accomplished by allowing
atomic oxygen to erode two opposing wedges of pyrolytic graphite that partially covered a photodiode.
As the wedges of pyrolytic graphite erode, the area of the photodiode that is illuminated by the Sun
increases. The short circuit current, which is proportional to the area of illumination, was to be measured
and recorded as a function of time. The short circuit current from a different photodiode, which was
oriented in the same direction and which had an unobstructed View of the Sun, was also to be recorded as
a reference current. The ratio of the two separate recorded currents should bear a linear relationship with
the accumulated atomic oxygen ﬂuence and be independent of the intensity of solar illumination. Ground
hyperthermal atomic oxygen exposure facilities were used to evaluate the linearity of the ratio of short
circuit currents to the atomic oxygen ﬂuence indicated that the deVice was both linear and capable of
measuring atomic oxygen ﬂuences up to at least 3.14><1022 atoms/cmz. Because the electronics failed to
operate correctly, the atomic oxygen ﬂuence had to be calculated based on the knowledge of the space

growth in the gap between the two pyrolytie graphite sensing wedges. An atomic oxygen ﬂuence of

1.37 i 0.16><1021atoms/em2 was measured. The ﬂuenee was ~ 30 percent lower than ﬂuenees measured

using Kapton H samples from an adjoining MISSE 6A PEC. Possible slippage due to launch or retrieval

Vibration or thermal cycling caused creep causing the gap between the pyrolytie graphite wedges to

become closer together by 0.0012 cm appears to be the most likely cause of the ﬂuence discrepancy.

14. ABSTRACT
An atomic oxygen ﬂuence monitor was ﬂown as part of the Materials International Space Station Experiment-6 (MISSE-6). The monitor
was designed to measure the accumulation of atomic oxygen ﬂuence with time as it impinged upon the ram surface of the MISSE 6B
Passive Experiment Container (PEC). This was an active experiment for which data was to be stored on a battery-powered data logger for
post-ﬂight retrieval and analysis. The atomic oxygen ﬂuence measurement was accomplished by allowing atomic oxygen to erode two
opposing wedges of pyrolytic graphite that partially covered a photodiode. As the wedges of pyrolytic graphite erode, the area of the
photodiode that is illuminated by the Sun increases. The short circuit current, which is proportional to the area of illumination, was to be
measured and recorded as a function of time. The short circuit current from a different photodiode, which was oriented in the same direction
and had an unobstructed View of the Sun, was also to be recorded as a reference current. The ratio of the two separate recorded currents
should bear a linear relationship with the accumulated atomic oxygen ﬂuence and be independent of the intensity of solar illumination.
Ground hyperthermal atomic oxygen exposure facilities were used to evaluate the linearity of the ratio of short circuit current to the atomic
oxygen ﬂuence. In ﬂight, the current measurement circuitry failed to operate properly, thus the overall atomic oxygen mission ﬂuence could
only be estimated based on the physical erosion of the pyrolytic graphite wedges. The atomic oxygen ﬂuence was calculated based on the
knowledge of the space atomic oxygen erosion yield of pyrolytic graphite measured from samples on the MISSE 2. The atomic oxygen
ﬂuence monitor, the expected result and comparison of mission atomic oxygen ﬂuence based on the erosion of the pyrolytic graphite and
Katon H atomic OX en ﬂuence witness samles are resented in this Haer.
