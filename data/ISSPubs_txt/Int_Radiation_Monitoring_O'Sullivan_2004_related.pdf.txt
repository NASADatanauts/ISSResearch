Abstract
Particle intensity, dose equivalent and absorbed dose have been measured on board the space shuttle Endeavour during STS—108
in December 2001 by Dublin Institute for Advanced Studies (DIAS). The dose estimates are based on very accurate measurements
of recoils produced in CR—39 by cosmic ray primary and secondary protons and heaVier nuclei and by secondary neutrons. The
corresponding LET spectra were used to determine dose equivalent and absorbed dose values. Estimates of the total ﬂux of Z 2 2
nuclei have been undertaken and a preliminary Charge spectrum was measured. Some comparisons are made with preliminary data
obtained on STS—105 (ISS Expedition) and other missions using CR—39 detectors.
