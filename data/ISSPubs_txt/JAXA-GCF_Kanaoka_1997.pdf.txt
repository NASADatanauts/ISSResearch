Figure 2. Homology of Hematopoietic PGDS with Members of GST Family
(A) Alignment of amino acid sequences of rat PGDS and GSTs of various classes whose tertiary structures are known. The elements of
secondary structure are highlighted in pink (a helix) and green (B strand). Based on the coordinate data by the current work, amino acid
residues forming GSH- and putative PGHZ binding sites are marked by yellow and blue circles, respectively, on the top of the alignment. A
yellow diamond represents a residue in the counter monomer composing the GSH binding site. A green circle represents a residue interacting
with both GSH and PGHZ. Amino acid sequences and the secondary structural information of GSTs were taken from SwissProt (sw) and
Protein Data Bank (P DB) (Bernstein et a|., 1977). Squid sigma (gts_omms|, sw;1GSQ, PDB; (Ji et a|., 1995), Rat mu (gtm1_rat, sw;1GST, PDB)

(B) Unrooted phylogenetic tree of hematopoietic PGDS and GSTs from sigma, pi, mu, and alpha classes. Amino acid sequences of GSTs
from rats, Drosophila melanogaster, and Schistosoma mansoni were selected as representatives for mammals, insects, and flukes to simplify
the phylogenetic analysis. House fly GST of the sigma class was also included to see the evolutionary relationship between these two species
of fly. Partial sequence data, redundant entries, and highly similar sequences (>90% identity to an already included entry) were excluded.
One representative sequence was included from GSTs and S-crystallins of squid/octopus because they were monophylic in the preliminary
clustering analysis. A multiple sequence alignment was constructed among hematopoietic PGDS and 21 members of GSTs from the four
classes (sigma, pi, mu, and a|pha)because the sequence identities of the theta class GSTs to the other classes of GSTs were too weak (ca.
20%) to obtain a reliable alignment. The amino acid sequences were taken from the sequence databases SwissProt (sw), PIR, and GenBank

Figure 4. Catalytic Pocket of Hematopoietic PGDS Complexed with GSH and a Proposed PGHZ Binding Model
(A) Cleft view of hematopoietic PGDS monomer and bound GSH. The putative substrate binding cleft is shown as a cartoon model with
Connolly surface. The kinked region after a4 from $100 to W104 is shown in pearl. C-terminal L199 is colored light green. Bound GSH is
shown in CPK model.
(B) Horizontal cross section view of the cleft shown in (A). The cleft is composed of three pockets. Pocket 1 opens to bound GSH in atomic
colored stick model with indole ring of W104 (pink)on the ceiling as well as to pockets 2 and 3.
(C)Mode| of PGHZ binding in the catalytic pocket. PGHZ (ball and stick model)was placed in the cleft taking account ofthe pocket environment
and the distance between the thiolic S atom ofGSH and the oxygen atoms of PGH2.The conformation ofa and (o chains of PGHZ was adjusted
to the surface of hematopoietic PGDS by means of tortional rotation of single bonds in these hydrocarbon chains using an energy-minimized
