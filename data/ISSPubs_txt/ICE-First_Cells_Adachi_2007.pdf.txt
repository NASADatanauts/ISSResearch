Abstract
We have investigated the effect of microgravity during spaceﬂight on body—wall muscle ﬁber size and muscle proteins in the paramy-
osin mutant of Caenorhabditis elegans. Both mutant and wild—type strains were subjected to 10 days of microgravity during spaceﬂight
and compared to ground control groups. No signiﬁcant change in muscle ﬁber size or quantity of the protein was observed in wild—type
worms; where as atrophy of body—wall muscle and an increase in thick ﬁlament proteins were observed in the paramyosin mutant unc-
15 (e73) animals after spaceﬂight. We conclude that the mutant with abnormal muscle responded to microgravity by increasing the total
amount of muscle protein in order to compensate for the loss of muscle function.
