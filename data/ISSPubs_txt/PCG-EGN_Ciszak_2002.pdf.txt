ABSTRACT: The enhanced gaseous nitrogen (EGN ) dewar is a cryogenic dry shipper with a sealed cylinder inserted
inside along with a temperature—monitori ng device, and is intended for macromolecular crystal | ization experi ments
on the International Space Station. Within the dewar, each crystallization experiment is contained as a solution
within a plastic capillary tube. The standard procedure for loading samples in these tubes has involved rapid freezing
of the precipitant and biomolecular solution, e.g., protein, directly in liquid nitrogen; this method, however, often
resulted in uncontrolled formation of ai r voids. These air pockets, or bubbles, can lead to irreproduci ble crystallization
results. A novel protocol has been developed to prevent formation of bubbles, and this has been tested in the laboratory
as well as aboard the International Space Station during a 42-day long mission of J uIy/August 2001. The gain or
loss of mass from solutions within the plastic capillaries revealed that mass transport occurred among separated
tubes, and that this mass transport was dependent upon the hygroscopic character of the solution contained in any
given tube. The surface area of the plastic capi | Iary tube also related to the observed mass transport. F urthermore,
the decreased mass of solutions of protein correlated to observed formation of protein crystals.
