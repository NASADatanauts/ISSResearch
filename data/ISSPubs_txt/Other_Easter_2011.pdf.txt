Abstract. Microgravity provides ideal experimental conditions for studying highly reactive
and under-cooled materials Where there is no contact between the sample and the other
experimental apparatus. The non-contact conditions allow material properties to be measured
from the oscillating liquid droplet response to perturbations. This work investigates the impact
of a strong magnetic ﬁeld on these measurement processes for weakly Viscous, electrically
conducting droplets. We present numerical results using an axisymmetric model that employs
the pseudo-spectral collocation method and a recently developed 3D model. Both numerical
models have been developed to solve the equations describing the coupled electromagnetic and
ﬂuid ﬂow processes. The models represent the changing surface shape that results from the
interaction between forces inside the droplet and the surface tension imposed boundary
conditions. The models are used to examine the liquid droplet dynamics in a strong DC
magnetic ﬁeld. In each case the surface shape is decomposed into a superposition of spherical
harmonic modes. The oscillation of the individual mode coefﬁcients is then analysed to
determine the oscillation frequencies and damping rates that are then compared to the low
amplitude solutions predicted by the published analytical asymptotic theory.
1. Introduction
The experiments With liquid metal droplets levitated in AC magnetic ﬁeld show difﬁculties related to
conﬁnement instability and a need for complex correction functions to establish a correlation between
the measurements and the droplet material properties [1-3]. A very intense internal ﬂuid ﬂow is
Visually observed, apparently being in the turbulent regime for earthbound conditions. The
combination of AC and DC magnetic ﬁelds was recently recognised as an efﬁcient tool for the
electromagnetic processing of materials and for thermophysical property measurements Without a
contact to contaminating walls [4, 5]. The intense AC magnetic ﬁeld required to produce levitation,
along With the buoyancy and thermo-capillary forces, results in turbulent large-scale toroidal
recirculation Within the droplet, Which prevents accurate measurements. The use of a homogenous DC
magnetic ﬁeld allows the toroidal ﬂow to be damped. However the intense recirculation generates
turbulence Which could make the effective Viscosity behave in a non-linear fashion depending on the
DC and AC magnetic ﬁeld intensity [5]. The ﬂow in a typical droplet is approaching the conditions
With laminar Viscosity and heat transfer When a uniform DC magnetic ﬁeld reaches about 4-5 T.
Even a purely DC magnetic levitation, using para- and dia-magnetic properties of the materials, can be
used for advanced material research [6, 7]. Due to the low values of magnetic susceptibility for typical
liquid materials the ﬁelds are large (typically > 10 T), requiring superconducting coils With an
associated cooling system. The vertical ﬁeld gradient permits to compensate gravity along the central

aXis, while the radial variation opposes motion of the droplet and acts to centre it on the aXis for stable
leVitation. However, in practice a small Vibration of the droplet as a whole remains even in carefully
conducted experiments [7].

The oscillations in a high DC magnetic ﬁeld are quite different for an electrically conducting
droplet, like liquid metal. In a recent publication [8] an asymptotic solution for very high magnetic
ﬁeld shows damping of the even aXisymmetric modes, but the odd modes are not damped or damped
moderately. The asymptotic linear theory predicts a considerable shift of the oscillating droplet
frequencies from the non-magnetic case. The transition of the droplet behavior from the low to high
magnetic ﬁeld is the subject of investigation in this paper. Numerical models of the ﬂow coupled with
the moving free surface give an insight to the dynamics and complexity of the events within leVitated
droplets of various sizes and magnetic ﬁeld intensities. For simplicity we will restrict the study to
uniform DC magnetic ﬁeld, leaving the more general cases of realistic gradient ﬁelds, as in the
solenoidal coils of superconducting magnets, for a future work.

2. Droplet oscillation mode decomposition
The general theoretical approach assumes that the free surface shape of the droplet is deﬁned by a
small deViation from a sphere of radius R0. The surface position can be represented by:
1;: R0[1+S(6,¢,t)]. (1)
The function deﬁning the deViation from a sphere (S) varies in time and space and can be represented
in spherical polar coordinates as a series of spherical harmonics:
L=ooM=L
saw =2 2A? (012M (6) cos<M¢>+AzM (01):” (6) mew), <2)
L20 M20
The YOU = P00 mode is included to account for conservation of mass (volume). The time-dependent
surface coefﬁcients are assumed to be harmonic with exponential damping:
A2” (t) = eos(a)£4t) eXp(—7/2Wt) (3)
The mode dependent oscillation frequency and damping constants are generally derived by following
a perturbation approach. The zero order result for the frequency was calculated by Rayleigh [9], and is
given for a droplet with density ,0 and surface tension F by:
M L(L—1)(L+2)F
0L = —3 (4)
,0 R0
The zero order result for the damping coefﬁcient for a droplet of Viscosity V was determined by Lamb
[10]:
M (L—l)(2L+l)v (5)
7/ L _ R3
It is interesting to note that the zero order approximation for both the frequency and the damping
constant are independent of the azimuthal number M. These formulae provide a good ﬁrst
approximation for low amplitude oscillations of droplets in microgravity conditions where the effects
of any external forces used to position the droplet are negligible compared with surface tension and
Viscous forces. However it is worth noting that these formulae are restricted and are only valid in the
limit that the amplitude of oscillation and also non-linear effects tend to zero. Modiﬁcations to these
lowest order formulae have been derived by Tsamopoulos & Brown [11]; they showed that for
‘moderate amplitude’, the frequency decreases with increasing amplitude and that a coupling of the
spherical harmonic modes appears at the second order.

Performing experiments in conditions where any external positioning forces are negligible (drop

shafts, parabolic ﬂights, space) is limited due to eXpense and also by the amount of time in which

experimental measurements can be made. The oscillating drop technique has been used in terrestrial
conditions Where the forces used to balance gravity and position the droplet are in the form of some
sort of leVitation, acoustic, aerodynamic, electromagnetic, 0r electrostatic. The use of a positioning
ﬁeld results in a more signiﬁcant impact on the droplet dynamics and adjustments to the theoretical
formulae are required. In the case of electromagnetic leVitation correction formulae have been derived
by Cummings & Blackburn [2], in Which the external ﬁeld is shown to remove the degeneracy of the
L=2 modes resulting in a splitting of the frequency spectrum. Other leVitation forces have also been
considered by Suryanarayana & Bayazitoglu [3].

Perhaps the most promising method of conﬁnement for conducting measurements using the
oscillating droplet technique is diamagnetic leVitation in a superconducting magnet. In this case the
weak diamagnetic properties eXhibited by many materials can be harnessed by a large magnetic ﬁeld
and used to balance the force of gravity Without the more invasive Lorentz forces associated With AC
electromagnetic leVitation. The resulting total magnetic force on the droplet allows gravity to be
compensated, although there is some variation in the force and a component that acts towards the aXis,
Which means that it is a good approximation to microgravity conditions but not completely equivalent.
F requency measurements using the oscillating drop technique have been conducted for water droplets
by Beaugnon et al. [6], Where estimates were made as to the frequency modiﬁcation due to the
magnetic ﬁeld. More recent experiments have been conducted by Hill & Eaves [7], in Which a
derivation of the frequency modiﬁcations due to the magnetic ﬁeld are made and compared With the
experimental results.

In a recent paper Priede [8], considers the effect of a constant high intensity magnetic ﬁeld on the
oscillation frequency and damping rate of an electrically conducting drop. The magnetic ﬁeld is shown
to signiﬁcantly alter the dynamics of the droplet With some interesting results. There are two distinct
cases; the longitudinal modes When (L-M) is odd and the transversal modes When (L-M) is even. The
frequencies for the odd and even modes respectively are given by:

M (L—1)(L+2)F
Q = —, (6)
,0 R0
L —1 L + 2 F
L (L + 1) —M p13,

The damping constant consists of two components, damping due to the magnetic ﬁeld B0 and
damping due to Viscosity V. The damping contribution of the magnetic ﬁeld for the odd and even
modes respectively are given by:

In the following section an outline is given of an aXisymmetric and a 3D numerical model that Will
be used to investigate these effects. F ollowing results are presented that demonstrate quantitatively the
theoretical predictions and the gradual transition With the increase of the magnetic ﬁeld.
3. Numerical Model
The 3D numerical model uses a grid point formulation of the spectral collocation method With the
ChebysheV grid for the radial direction and F ourier in the angular directions. The model uses a
coordinate transformation for the free surface, Which allows the problem to be solved on a unit sphere.

The total force due to the magnetic ﬁeld consists of two components, the Lorentz force due to the

force, Which is potential and is implemented in the model as boundary condition to the pressure
equation along With the gravitational force, Which is also potential. The full boundary conditions for

The Lorentz body force requires an additional equation to be solved for the electric potential. The
electric current density is given by:

The equation for the electric potential is obtained from the charge conservation condition:
V-J =0. (24)
Taking the divergence of the electric current density gives:
V2¢E =V-(VXB). (25)
This equation is solved subject to the boundary condition:
J-en = 0. (26)

The magnetic ﬁeld in this paper is mostly prescribed as the constant ﬁeld given in cylindrical
coordinates by:

B(r,¢,z) =(0,0,BO). (27)
4. Results & Discussion

aXisymmetric [l3] and 3D modes compared With theoretical asymptotic results from [8].

The material chosen for the numerical test cases is either molten silicon having the material

susceptibility, and conductivity, respectively: F = 0.865 N m'1 , ,0 = 2510.0 Kg m'3 , V = 3.75e-7
m2 s'1 , XV = -4.2e-6, G = 1.3e6 S ml; or for the molten nickel: F = 1.778 N m'1 , ,0 = 7995 Kg m'3 ,

The ﬁrst case considered is the aXisymmetric mode 1’02 for the droplet of radius (R0 = 5.0 mm), initial

amplitude (A02 = 0.01), and the velocity V=0. The constant magnetic ﬁeld has strength (BO = 2.5T).

The initial amplitude corresponds to a polar deformation of 1% 0f the equilibrium droplet radius. A

Theoretical asymptotic analysis for high B shows that the mode is over-damped by the magnetic
ﬁeld, the oscillation frequency is zero and the magnetic damping constant is given by:

The reason for this result is clear When observing the ﬂow proﬁle in the F igure 1. The ﬂow
component in radial direction u is perpendicular to the uniform magnetic ﬁeld along the z-aXis. Due to
the symmetry of the ﬂow it is not possible to satisfy mass continuity With a potential ﬂow only in the
z-direction. F igure 2 shows the results of a numerical simulation compared With the theoretical
asymptotic result. In this case the numerical model shows a higher level of damping than the
theoretical because the result (28) does not include the Viscous damping for the aXisymmetric mode at
the ﬁnite value of the magnetic ﬁeld. The numerical results show the dependence on the material
properties and the ﬁeld intensity. For the very high field (10 T) the damping leads to a very slow
motion, and the droplet reaches the spherical shape in a considerably longer time than Without ﬁeld.

With the theoretical result. There is reasonably good agreement With all 3 results.

Figure 4 shows 21 Ni droplet oscillating in the (1’03) mode With a high external magnetic ﬁeld BO

restrictions are not present here and the droplet continues to oscillate in the (1’03) mode. The internal
ﬂow is quite different to the case Without the magnetic ﬁeld (Figure 5). In the presence of the strong
DC magnetic ﬁeld in the z-aXis direction there is practically no radial ﬂow, and the ﬂuid oscillates in
columns along the direction of the external magnetic ﬁeld.

It is of interest to investigate the oscillation change With the gradual increase of the magnetic ﬁeld
magnitude. Rayleigh normal mode frequency remains practically unchanged for a moderate magnetic
ﬁeld 0.5 T, however With the increased damping rate (F igure 6). Oscillations are close to overdamping
at about 2 T. For extreme ﬁelds (10 T and more) the frequency gradually decreases to the asymptotic

value given in [8]. We can conclude from these results that a DC ﬁeld up to 0.5 -l T is beneﬁcial to
stabilize the oscillation, damp the turbulence While preserving the Rayleigh frequency. High DC ﬁelds
(5 T and more) need updated models to interpret measurements. F igure 7 demonstrates that the
asymptotic solution predicted frequency is achieved for the ﬁeld 0f 10 T.

The two results show very good agreement, the oscillation is unaffected by the external magnetic ﬁeld.
The reason for this behavior can be clearly understood from the plots of the ﬂuid ﬂow variables in
F igure 11. F luid ﬂow for this mode only occurs in the X-y plane resulting in an electric ﬁeld (Vx B)
perpendicular to the ﬂow but conﬁned in the same plane. Due to the potential nature of the ﬂuid ﬂow,
charge continuity cannot be satisﬁed and so an equal and opposite electric ﬁeld (—V¢) eXists that
results in zero net current and n0 damping of the ﬂow by the Lorentz force.
5. Conclusions
The oscillating drop technique is a valuable method for measuring surface tension and Viscosity of
materials in a non-contact environment. Numerical results have been presented that conﬁrm the
asymptotic theoretical results relating surface tension and Viscosity to frequency and damping rates for
conducting droplets in a constant magnetic ﬁeld. F urther work involves use of the 3D numerical model
to ﬁnd qualitative and quantitative results for the oscillating drop technique in the presence of gravity
forces. Comparison Will also be made With experimental results Where large amplitude and non-linear
effects have a signiﬁcant contribution to the dynamics and can impact on the measurement process.
