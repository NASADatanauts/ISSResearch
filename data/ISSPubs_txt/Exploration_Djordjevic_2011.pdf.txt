Abstract: In order to achieve multi-gigabit transmission (projected for
2020) for the use in interplanetary communications, the usage of large
number of time slots in pulse-position modulation (PPM), typically used in
deep—space applications, is needed, Which imposes stringent requirements
on system design and implementation. As an alternative satisfying high-
bandwidth demands of future interplanetary communications, While keeping
the system cost and power consumption reasonably low, in this paper, we
describe the use of orbital angular momentum (0AM) as an additional
degree of freedom. The DAM is associated With azimuthal phase of the
complex electric ﬁeld. Because 0AM eigenstates are orthogonal the can be
used as basis functions for N-dimensional signaling. The DAM modulation
and multiplexing can, therefore, be used, in combination With other degrees
of freedom, to solve the high-bandwidth requirements of future deep-space
and near-Earth optical communications. The main challenge for 0AM deep-
space communication represents the link between a spacecraft probe and the
Earth station because in the presence of atmospheric turbulence the
orthogonality between 0AM states is no longer preserved. We Will show
that in combination With LDPC codes, the OAM-based modulation schemes
can operate even under strong atmospheric turbulence regime. In addition,
the spectral efﬁciency of proposed scheme is N2/log2N times better than that
of PPM.

1. Introduction

Power-efﬁcient modulation schemes, such as pulse-position modulation (PPM), are widely

adopted in current deep-space optical communications [1—6]. The very large bandwidth of

these links (compared to RF links) has made the low spectral efﬁciency of PPM less of a

concern. However, in order to achieve multi-gigabit transmission (projected for 2020) for the

use in interplanetary communications [5], the use of large number of time slots in PPM is
needed, which imposes stringent requirements on system design and implementation. On the
other hand, we have shown recently [7,8] that through the use of orbital angular momentum

(0AM) modulation we can satisfy high-bandwidth demands of future interplanetary

communications, while keeping the system cost and power consumption reasonably low. The

DAM is associated with azimuthal phase of the complex electric ﬁeld. Because 0AM

eigenstates are orthogonal, in principle, arbitrary number of bits per single photon can be

transmitted. The ability to generate/analyze states with different OAMs, by using
interferometric 0r holographic methods [9—13] allows the realization of deep-space/near-Earth
optical communication systems with ultra-high photon efﬁciencies expressed in terms of
number of bits per photon. The DAM modulation and multiplexing can, therefore, be used, in
combination with other degrees of freedom, to solve the high-bandwidth requirements of
future deep-space and near-Earth optical communications. By increasing the number of CAM

transmission at these higher speeds by using low-density parity-check (LDPC) codes [14—17].
Dramatic increase in photon efﬁciency through 0AM modulation and multiplexing will
provide revolutionary capabilities for future deep-space/near-Earth applications. The main
challenge for 0AM deep-space communication represents the link between a spacecraft probe
and the Earth station because in the presence of atmospheric turbulence the orthogonality
between 0AM states is no longer preserved.

In this paper, we will show that in combination with LDPC codes, OAM-based
modulation schemes can operate even under strong atmospheric turbulence regime. The
following multi-gigabit enabling approaches for deep-space and near-Earth optical
communications based on 0AM are described: (i) 0AM multiplexing (Sec. 2); (ii) N-
dimensional 0AM modulation (Sec. 2); and (iii) orthogonal 0AM division multiplexing (Sec.
3), similar to OFDM [24]. We will also describe different approaches to deal with
atmospheric turbulence induced 0AM crosstalk including: (1) equalization; (2) OAM-time
coding, which is analogous to the space-time coding; and (3) adaptive modulation and coding
(AMC).

Notice that our previous paper on 0AM modulation [18] deals with terrestrial FSO
communications, and it employs volume holograms to perform 0AM
modulation/deniodulation, while in this paper instead we use multimode ﬁber (MMF) to
perform 0AM modulation/demodulation. Moreover, Ref. [18] does not discuss at all neither
orthogonal 0AM division multiplexing nor compensation of CAM crosstalk effects
introduced by atmospheric turbulence. Further, we provide detailed description of CAM
demodulator and iterative demapper/decoder. Finally, we describe both direct detection and
coherent detection 0AM demodulators.

The paper is organized as follows. In Section 2, we describe the concepts of CAM
multiplexing and modulation. We also describe an N—dimensional OAM-based coded
modulation scheme suitable for deep-space and near-Earth applications. The DAM division
multiplexing is described in Section 3. Different methods to re-establish the orthogonality of
CAM modes, after transmission over atmospheric turbulence channels, are described in
Section 4. We evaluate the suitability of OAM-based coded-modulation schemes for deep-
space/near-Earth applications in Section 5. Section 6 is devoted to concluding remarks.

2. Deep-space and near-Earth optical Communications based on LDPC-coded 0AM
modulation
In this section, we describe how to simultaneously increase the photon and spectral
efﬁciencies based on N—dimensional 0AM coded modulation. The angular momentum, L, of
the classical electromagnetic ﬁeld can be written as [19]
inj ExAdV+ij 2 E (rxV)AdV (1)
47:0 V 47w V kzx’y’z k k 7
where E is the electric ﬁeld intensity, A is the vector potential associated with magnetic ﬁeld
intensity H by H =V><A and electric ﬁeld intensity by E = -c_16A/ 81 , and c is the speed
of light. The second term in (1) is identiﬁed with the DAM because of the presence of the
angular momentum operator rtherm. Among various optical beams that can carry 0AM,
Laguerre-Gauss (LG) vortex beams can easily be implemented. For example, a ﬁeld
distribution of LG beam traveling along z-direction can be expressed in cylindrical
coordinates (r,¢,z) (r denotes the radial distance from propagation axis, ¢ denotes the
azimuthal angle and Z denotes the propagation distance) as follows [10]:

"4","where w(z) = w0[1 + (Z/ZR)]1/2 with wo being the zero-order Gaussian radius at the waist,
ZR 2 7rwo2 / xi is the Rayleigh range (with 9» being the wavelength), k = 271:0» is the propagation
constant, and Llp(-) is the associated Laguerre polynomial, with p and 1 representing the radial
and azimuthal mode numbers, respectively. It can be seen from (2) that lth mode of LG beam
has the azimuthal angular dependence of the form exp(-jl¢), and consequently, l is also called
the azimuthal mode number (index). For I = 0, ﬁeld u(r,¢,z) becomes a zero-order Gaussian
beam, that is the TEMOO mode. For p = 0, Llp(-) = 1 for all Is, so that the intensity of a LG
mode is a ring of radius proportional to (|l|)1/2, as illustrated in Fig. 1(a). It can be shown [10]
that for ﬁxed p, the following principle of ethogonality is satisﬁed:

(ummmmp) 2] 14;}, (r,¢,z)un,p (r,¢,z)rdrd¢ = {I lum’pi rdrd¢, n m (3)

0, n 72 m

Clearly, different 0AM states for ﬁxed p are mutually orthogonal and as such they can be
used as basis functions for 0AM modulation. The number of CAM states to be used depends
on atmospheric turbulence strength. For N = 2L + 1, the corresponding 0AM states can be
indexed by l where 1 takes values in the set {-L,-L + 1,...,-1,0,1,...,L}. By increasing the
number of dimensions (i.e., the number of CAM eigenstates), we can increase the aggregate
data rate of the system.

The transmitter and receiver block diagrams for 0AM modulation are shown in Fig. 1.
Previously, we studied the use of volume holograms based multidimensional terrestrial FSO
communication [18]. The terrestrial FSO system described in [18] employs the volume
holograms to perform 0AM multiplexing/de-multiplexing. Instead of using the set of
holograms to impose different 0AM states, here we use mode multiplexer/demultiplexer
based on multimode ﬁbers as shown in Fig. 1(b)/(c). During mode multiplexing, a continuous
wave laser diode signal is split into N branches by using a power splitter (such as 1:N star
coupler) to feed N Mach-Zehnder modulators (MZMs), each corresponding to one of the N
0AM modes. The mode demultiplexer can be implemented by propagating the multimode
signal in opposite direction, as shown in Fig. 1(0). The jth input to the jth MZM, 13 j S N,
corresponds to the jth coordinate of the signal to be modulated (see Fig. 1b). The output of
mode multiplexer is expanded by telescope and transmitted towards remote destination. The
DAM multiplexing is obtained by summing up N independent streams per each 0AM state
into a single optical beam. Clearly, when 0AM transmitter and receiver are implemented as
shown in Fig. 1(b,c) we are not able to distinguish between 0AM modes with azimuthal mode
numbers of the same magnitude but of opposite sign. Nevertheless, distinguishable modes I =
0,1,...,L (for ﬁxed p) are still orthogonal. The mode detector shown in Fig. 1(e), instead of
being implemented based on Fig. 1(c) it can be implemented based on integrated ring-shaped
detector with N-different p.i.n. regions to capture different l—modes, as illustrated in Fig. 1(a)
for p = 0. Such a mode detector will have N outputs that correspond to N-projections along
0AM modes. After this generic description of CAM based deep-space/near-Earth optical
communication systems, we provide more details of CAM transmitter and receiver.

The K different bit streams coming from different information sources are encoded using
(n,km) (m = 1,...,K) LDPC codes, as shown in the Fig. 1(d). The outputs of the encoders are
interleaved by the K X n block interleaver. The block interleaver accepts bits from the
encoders row-wise and outputs bits column-wise t0 the mapper, which accepts K bits at each
time instance 1'. The mapper determines the corresponding MN-ary signal constellation point
by

s; =CNZ:I(DMCDJ.; i=1,2,---,MN (4)
where M is the number of amplitude levels per 0AM state and CN is the normalization
constant. The set {(Dl, (D2,. . .,(DN} represents a set of N orthogonal 0AM basis functions, while
with guy- we denoted 0AM modulation coordinates of ith constellation point. The signals are

(see Fig. 1).

The number OAM modes N to be used is determined by the desired ﬁnal rate and current
channel conditions. The simplest OAM—based coded modulation scheme With direct detection

constellation can be obtained as the N—dimensional Cartesian product of a one-dimensional
signal constellation originating from non-negative pulse-amplitude modulation (PAM). At the
receiver side (see Fig. 1(d)), after 0AM demodulation (or mode demultiplexing) and
photodetection, the outputs of the N branches of the demodulator are sampled at the symbol
rate, and the corresponding samples, after analog-to-digital conversion, are forwarded to the a
posteriori probability (APP) demapper. The orthogonality among 0AM modes in realistic
deep—space and near-Earth optical communication systems can be re-established by various
MIMO and equalization techniques, as discussed in Section 4. The APP demapper provides
the bit LLRs required for iterative LDPC decoding (see Fig. 1e). The 1th branch in Fig. 1(1)

Therefore, the jth bit reliability is calculated as the logarithm of the ratio of a probability that
c]- = 0 and probability that c]- = 1. In the nominatcr, we perform the summation over all
symbols S having 0 at the observed position j, while in the denominator over all symbols S
having 1 at the same position j. With La(ck) we denoted the prior (extrinsic) information
determined from the APP demapper. The inner summation in (13) is performed over a11bits of

to LDPC decoders, which provide extrinsic bit LLRs for demapper according to (12), and are
used as inputs to (11) as the prior information.

Notice that deep-space/near-Earth optical communication systems shown in Fig. 1 are
based on direct detection. When coherent detection is used, the corresponding modulator can
be: (i) one-dimensicnal MZM biased at null point (see Fig. 1(b)), (ii) two-dimensional
modulator based on I/Q modulator (see Fig. 2(a)) and (iii) four-dimensional (see Fig. 2(b)).
When I/Q modulator is used, in addition to N 0AM orthogonal modes, we employ the in-
phase (I) and quadrature (Q) components so that the corresponding space is 2N—dimensi0nal.
On the other hand, when four-diniensional modulator is used, with two coordinates being I-
and Q-ccordinates in X-polarization and two coordinates being I- and Q-ccordinates in y
polarization, the corresponding space is 4N—dimensi0na1. The 4N—dimensi0nal scheme allows
even 4N—bits to be transmitted per single symbol, which represents an energy-efﬁcient
communication scheme. However, the complexity of such receiver might be too high even for
near-Earth applications. The one-dimensicnal coherent detection scheme seems to be a good
compromise between optical link energy-efﬁciency and receiver complexity. In Fig. 2(c), we
show the receiver conﬁguration with coherent detection that assumes that one-dimensional
MZMs are used. One laser is used to detect all coordinates, whose output is used as an input
to 1:N power splitter. The output of balanced detector 71 (n = 0,1,. . .,N-1) provides the
projection along 0AM state n. This coherent detection receiver scheme; composed of mode-
demultiplexer, balanced coherent detectors, power splitter and local laser; can be integrated on
a single chip using hybrid opto-electrcnic integrated circuit (OEIC) technology.

Notice that different orthogonal basis functions can be used instead of orthogonal 0AM
eigenstates (e.g., [20], [21—23]). For example, the orthogonal subcarriers can be used as the

basis functions for multidimensional signaling, which was the subject of Ref. [20]. However,
the subcarrier-based multidimensional signaling cannot be used to simultaneously improve
SNR sensitivity and spectral efﬁciency. For example, if we are concerned with SNR
sensitivity we can use the orthogonal subcarriers as basis functions in multidimensional
signaling to increase the Euclidean distance between signal constellation points, while
keeping the total signal bandwidth the same. In proposed scheme, however, we can
simultaneously improve the SNR sensitivity and spectral efﬁciency. Namely, by increasing
the number of CAM eigenstates, used for basis functions, we can dramatically increase the
aggregated data rate, while keeping the symbol rate ﬁxed, as the increase of the number of
CAM modes does not lead to bandwidth expansion. In order to achieve multi-gigabit
transmission, which is projected for 2020, for the use in interplanetary communications [5],
the use of better spectral efﬁcient schemes, such as proposed one, is needed. The current
deep—space optical communications are based on PPM, and in order to achieve the multi-Gb/s
data rate, predicted by Hemmati in [5], a huge number of time-slots will be needed in PPM,
which introduces too stringent requirements from implementation point of View.

The transmitter and receiver conﬁgurations for orthogonal 0AM division multiplexing are
shown in Fig. 3(a), and (b), respectively. It has certain similarities with OFDM [24]. The
transmitter conﬁguration up to the mapper is very similar to that shown in Fig. 1(e). The
mapper accepts K bits at time instance 1' from the (K X n) interleaver column-wise and
determines the corresponding M—ary (M = 2K) signal constellation point (¢U, ¢QJ-) assuming a

correspond to in-phase (I) and quadrature (Q) components of M—ary 2D constellation. The 2D
constellation points, after serial-to-parallel (S/P) conversion, are used as the inputs to I/Q
modulators of CAM transmitters shown in Fig. 3(a). On the receiver side, upon 0AM
demultiplexing and detection as shown in Fig. 3(b), the soft estimates of symbols §k carried
by kth 0AM state are forwarded to the APP demapper, Which determines the symbol LLRs.
The soft symbol estimates in the kth 0AM state §k are obtained by using one of the DAM-
crosstalk compensation techniques described in next section. The bit LLRs needed for LDPC
decoders are calculated in the bit LLR calculation block in similar fashion to that described in

4. Compensation of CAM crosstalk introduced by atmospheric turbulence
In this section, we describe several approaches to compensate for atmospheric turbulence
effects.
0AM Channel Model
Atmospheric turbulence is caused by variations in the refractive index of the transmission
medium due to inhomogeneities in temperature and pressure caused by solar heating and
Wind. The optical turbulent channel has been intensively studied, and various models have
been proposed to describe turbulence-induced performance degradation [6]. The OAM-based
FSO channel model With coherent detection can be described as follows:
hll [112 hi,N
y=Hx+w, H: 21 22 2’N’ , (14)
hN,1 hN,2 hN,N
Where x = [x1 x2 xN]T is transmitted vector With ith complex number component being the
in-phase/quadrature (I/Q) signal constellation point transmitted using ith 0AM state; y = [y1 y2
yN]T is the received vector; w = [w W2 wN]T is the vector of noise samples; and H
represents the channel matrix With rank(H) = N that corresponds to the number of CAM states
not experiencing fading (due to atmospheric turbulence). The channel matrix coefficients can
be determined by using a training sequence. The DAM FSO channel model (14) is similar to a
Wireless communication MIMO model [25—29] and, therefore, different techniques used in
spatial interference cancellation are directly applicable here. Below we describe equalization,
OAM-time coding, and adaptive modulation and coding. Other methods suitable to deal With
atmospheric turbulence induced crosstalk among 0AM states include: 0AM diversity; linear

"10","interfaces: zero-forcing interface and minimum mean-square error (MMSE) interface;
nonlinear interfaces: vertical and diagonal BLAST [29], iterative atmospheric turbulence
cancellation; parallel decomposition of OAM-MIMO by singular value decomposition (SVD)
0f the channel matrix; and OAM-beam forming.
0AM crosstalk compensation by equalization
The scalar representation of Eq. (14),
N
yi=Zhinj+wi; i=1,2,---,N (15)
j=1
indicates that ith 0AM detector output can be represented as a ﬁnite impulse response (FIR)
ﬁlter. That is, the channel model (15) is similar to an intersymbol interference (181) model so
that various channel equalization techniques [26—30] can be used to compensate for 0AM
crosstalk including a feed-forward equalizer (FFE), decision-feedback equalizer (DFE),
maximum-likelihood sequence detector (MLSD), and a turbo equalizer.
0AM-time coding
If we allow the signal designs to be extended over multiple 0AM states and over multiple
symbol times, we can refer to these designs as the OAM-time codes, in analogy to the space-
time codes used in wireless communications [25—29]. Most space-time codes designed for
wireless communications are straightforwardly applicable here, but they are most probably
not optimal. Under the assumption that the F80 channel is quasi-static for the duration of NS
symbols, which is true for multi-gigabit transmission, the DAM FSO channel inputs and
outputs are matrices, with dimensions corresponding to space-coordinate (the number of
CAM modes) and time-coordinate (the number of symbol intervals). This can be modeled by
Y 2 IR + W, (16)
where
Y : |:y19y29""'9yNS :l : (Yij)N><NS 9X :|:x19x29""'9st:|:(Xij)NxNS (17)
W =[w19W29---9WN;]=(Wz-j)zvxm
and where N is the number of CAM modes. Let us observe an OAM-time code in which the
receiver has the knowledge of the channel matrix H . Under maximum-likelihood (ML)
detection, the optimum transmit matrix is obtained by the following minimization:
A NY 2
X = ' . — H . 18
arg Xglia; Eb; x; H , < >
where the minimization is performed over all possible OAM-time input matrices.
Adaptive modulation and coding (AMC)
There are many parameters that can be varied at the transmitter side to accommodate FSO
channel conditions, including data rate, power, coding rate, and combinations of different
adaptation parameters. In several of recent papers (e.g., [31—33]), we have studied various
adaptive modulation and coding schemes suitable for dealing with atmospheric turbulence for
different multilevel modulation schemes. This study can be extended to coded 0AM
modulation schemes.
5. Performance analysis
In Fig. 4, we show the BER performance of (girth-12, column-weight-3) LDPC(15120,7560)-
coded N—dimensional (ND) 0AM modulation versus PPM. On horizontal aXis we use average

The results of simulations shown in Figs. 4-6 are obtained for Poisson deep-space optical
channel model for the average number of background photons of 0.1. We assume that residual
crosstalk on a given 0AM mode is given by nX = 0.1. From Fig. 4 it is clear that as we
increase the number of dimensions, the improvement of ND-OAM over PPM is larger. The
improvement (measured at BER of 10—6) ranges from 0.67 dB for N = 2 to 2.81 dB for N = 8.
Moreover, the spectral efﬁciency SE of ND-OAM is
SE,ND-OAM _ 10g2 2N/(1/71) _ N (19)
SE,PPM 10g2 M/(M / TS) 10g2 M/M

times better than that of PPM. In (19), with T S we denoted the signaling interval (reciprocal of
a symbol rate). For the same number of dimensions (M = N), the spectral efﬁciency of ND-
OAM is N2/10g2N times better. For example, for M = N = 8, the spectral efﬁciency of ND-
OAM is 21.334 times better.

In Figs. 5-6, we evaluate performance of LDPC-coded ND-OAM in the presence of
atmospheric turbulence, under medium (Fig. 5) and strong (Fig. 6) turbulence regimes. (For
deﬁnition of Rytov standard deviation GR see [6].) For N = 8, the degradation in performance
ranges from 2.02 dB in medium turbulence regime to 2.87 dB in strong turbulence regime (at
BER of10‘6).

In Fig. 7, we evaluate (girth-8, column-weight—4) LDPC(4320,3242)-coded ND-OAM
scheme for use in near-Earth applications. Both direct and coherent detection schemes are
evaluated. In simulations, we assume that 0AM crosstalk distribution follows the Gaussian
distribution (the same assumption was used in [10]), which motives the use of signal-tO-noise-
and-crosstalk ratio (SCNR) instead of signal-to—noise ratio (SNR). Direct detection schemes
can operate properly in weak turbulence regime, while in strong turbulence regime they
exhibit error ﬂoor phenomena (not shown in ﬁgure) and as such must be combined with
repetition MIMO schemes. On the other hand, the coherent detection schemes with M = 2 and
N22 can operate even in strong turbulence regime for reasonable high SCNRs, as shown in
Fig. 7.

6. Concluding remarks
In this paper, we studied the use of CAM as an additional degree of freedom for modulation
and multiplexing in deep-space and near-Earth applications. The following multi-gigabit
enabling approaches for deep-space communication based on 0AM have been described:
0AM multiplexing, N—dimensional 0AM modulation, and orthogonal 0AM division
multiplexing. We demonstrate by Monte Carlo simulations, over the atmospheric turbulence
channels, that proposed schemes can operate under strong atmospheric turbulence and provide
dramatic improvement in throughput. We have shown that the improvement of ND-OAM

"13","over PPM, for the same number of dimensions, (measured at BER of 10—6) ranges from
0.67dB for N = 2 to 2.81 dB for N = 8. Moreover, the spectral efﬁciency, for the same number
of dimensions, of ND-OAM is N2/10g2N times better. The proposed OAM-based schemes,
therefore, represent the excellent candidates for next generation deep-space and near-Earth
optical communications. In addition to next generation deep-space/near-Earth optical
communication enabling technologies, we have described different approaches to deal with
atmospheric turbulence induced 0AM crosstalk including equalization, OAM-time coding,
and adaptive modulation and coding.

Notice there is a signiﬁcant effort to improve the result from [2] in terms coming closer to
the channel capacity limits. Some researchers are trying to improve this result even for a
fraction of dB. With the proposed scheme, however, we are able to outperform LDPC-coded
PPM for even 2.81 dB for N = 8, and at the same time improve spectral efﬁciency 21 times
(also for N = 8), indicating that the proposed scheme is a promising candidate for next
generation deep-space and near-Earth optical communications.

Some other applications of interest of OAM-based systems described in this paper include:
providing ultra-high-speed Internet connection, increasing data rate and reducing system cost
and deployment time in access networks, enabling ground-t0-satellite/satellite-t0-gr0und FSO
communications at high-speed, enabling ultrahigh-speed intersatellite communications, and
possibly enabling aircraft-to—satellite/ satellite-to—aircraft high-data-rate communications.
