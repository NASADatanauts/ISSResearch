Abstract
Bone homeostasis strongly depends on fine tuned mechanosensitive regulation signals from environmental
forces into biochemical responses. Similar to the ageing process, during spaceﬂights an altered
mechanotransduction occurs as a result of the effects of bone unloading, eventually leading to loss
of functional tissue. Although spaceﬂights represent the best environment to investigate near—zero
gravity effects, there are major limitations for setting up experimental analysis. A more feasible
approach to analyse the effects of reduced mechanostimulation on the bone is represented by the
‘simulated microgravity’ experiments based on: (1) in vitro studies, involving cell cultures studies
and the use of bioreactors with tissue engineering approaches; (2) in vivo studies, based on animal
models; and (3) direct analysis on human beings, as in the case of the bed rest tests. At present,
advanced tissue engineering methods allow investigators to recreate bone microenvironment
in vitro for mechanobiology studies. This group and others have generated tissue ‘organoids’ to mimic
in vitro the in vivo bone environment and to study the alteration cells can go through when subjected
to unloading. Understanding the molecular mechanisms underlying the bone tissue response to
mechanostimuli will help developing new strategies to prevent loss of tissue caused by altered
mechanotransduction, as well as identifying new approaches for the treatment of diseases Via drug
testing. This review focuses on the effects of reduced gravity on bone mechanobiology by providing
the up-to-date and state of the art on the available data by drawing a parallel with the suitable tissue
engineering systems. Copyright © 2014 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.
