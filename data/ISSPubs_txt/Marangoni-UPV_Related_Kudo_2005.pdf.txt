Abstract
Feedback control on was carried out on non—linear thermocapillary convections in a half—zone liquid bridge of a high Prandtl
number ﬂuid. In the liquid bridge, the convection changes from a two—dimensional steady ﬂow to a three—dimensional oscillatory
one at a critical temperature difference. Feedback control was realized by locally modifying the free surface temperature using local
temperature measured at different positions. The present study aims to develop a new control scheme by taking spatio—temporal
azimuthal distribution of temperature ﬂuctuation into account. The new control scheme achieved signiﬁcant attenuation of the tem—
perature oscillation compared with the previous one in a high Marangoni number range.
