Abstract. Constant velocity Off-Vertical aXis rotation (OVAR) provides dynamic linear acceleration stimuli that can be used to as-

sess otolith function. Eight astronauts were rotated in darkness about their longitudinal axis 200 off vertical at low (0.125 Hz) and

high (0.5 Hz) frequencies and their responses were compared before and after spaceﬂight. Eye movements were recorded using

infrared Videography and perceived motion was evaluated using a joystick with four degrees of freedom — pitch and roll tilt, front-

back and lateral translation. Low-frequency OVAR generates tilt otolith-induced responses — modulation of ocular counter-roll

and counter-pitch with perceived conical motion path — whereas high-frequency OVAR generates translational otolith-induced

responses — modulation of horizontal and vergence slow phase velocity with perceived cylindrical motion path. While there were

transient changes in the amplitude of the translational ocular responses on landing day, there were no major changes in the tilt

ocular reﬂexes after adaptation to weightlessness. However, there was an increase in sensitivity to motion perception after space-

ﬂight. Direct comparisons of pre- and postﬂight stimuli suggested that OVAR 0n landing day was less provocative of motion

sickness than before spaceﬂight. These results conﬁrm that some otolith reﬂexes elicited during passive motion may not be a1-

tered by short-duration spaceﬂight — or may readapt very quickly — and that the resolution of sensory conﬂict associated with

postﬂight recovery involves higher-order neural processes.
