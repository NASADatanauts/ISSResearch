Abstract: The lichen Xanthoria elegans has been exposed to space conditions and simulated Mars-analogue
conditions in the lichen and fungi experiment (LIFE) on the- International Space Station (ISS). After
several simulations and short space exposure experiments such as BIOPAN, this was the ﬁrst long-term
exposure of eukaryotic organisms to the hostile space conditions of the low Earth orbit (LEO). The
biological samples were integrated in the EXPOSE-E facility and exposed for 1.5 years outside the ISS to the
combined impact of insolation, ultraviolet (UV)—irradiation, cosmic radiation, temperatures and vacuum
conditions of LEO space. Additionally, a subset of X. elegans samples was exposed to simulated Martian
environmental conditions by applying Mars-analogue atmosphere and suitable solar radiation ﬁlters. After
their return to Earth the viability of the lichen samples was ascertained by viability analysis of LIVE/DEAD
staining and confocal laser-scanning microscopy, but also by analyses of chlorophyll a ﬂuorescence.
According to the LIVEIDEAD staining results. the lichen photobiont showed an average Viability rate
of 71%, whereas the even more resistant lichen mycobiont showed a rate of 84%. Postuexposure Viability
rates did not signiﬁcantly vary among the applied exposure conditions. This remarkable viability is discussed
in the context of particular protective mechanisms of lichens such as anhydrobiosis and UV—screening
pigments.
