Abstract

The orientation of Listing’s Plane (LP) was examined under one—g and zero—g conditions during parabolic ﬂight. Ten healthy subjects
participated in the experiment. In zero—g the orientation of LP was consistently altered. LP elevation was tilted backwards by approx. 100
(p = 0.003). The azimuth angles of the left and right eyes also diverged in zero—g, with a statistically signiﬁcant change ([9 = 0.04) in the
vergence angle between 6.10 and 11.80. A discernible dissociation in torsional eye position was also observed, which proved to be sta—
tistically signiﬁcant (p = 0.03). The thickness of LP was found to be of the order of 1°, and was not signiﬁcantly altered by the transitions
between one—g and zero—g. Additional control experiments involving repeated measurements of LP under normal laboratory conditions
demonstrated that the parameters of LP remain stable in the individual.

The parabolic ﬂight results demonstrate that in contrast to re—orientation in the one—g gravitational ﬁeld, the elimination of gravity
represents a qualitative change for the vestibular and oculomotor systems. It appears that given the lack of voluntary control of ocular
torsion, the tonic otolith afferences are instrumental in the stabilisation of torsional eye position and consequently of Listing’s Plane. The
observed torsional divergence also provides support for the so—called otolith asymmetry hypothesis.

Fig. 5. Individual plots of the displacement planes for each of the ﬁve subjects evaluated binocularly. For each subject the upper plots show the elevation
(Hz VS. Hx) and the lower plots the azimuth (Hx VS. Hy) for both eyes. Data for one-g (left) and for zero-g (right) conditions are included. Notable are the
consistent backward tilts of the elevation and the divergence of the azimuth projections during the zero-g phases. There is also a discernible shift of LP
along the X-axis in most cases — corresponding to a tonic dissociation in the torsional position of the eye (see Table 2 for values).
