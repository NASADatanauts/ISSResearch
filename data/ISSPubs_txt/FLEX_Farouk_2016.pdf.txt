Abstract
We report experiments and detailed numerical modeling of mixtures of primary reference fuel (PRF)
droplets consisting of n—heptane and iso—octane With initial droplet diameters of 0.5 and 3.51 mm. The re—
sults show a quasi—steady, low temperature (or “Cool Flame” (CB) droplet burning mode that stems from a
varying two—stage chemical kinetic behavior of the combustion chemistry. The simulations further illustrate,
that the CF droplet burning mode in 1 atm air is dependent upon the iso—octane fraction and droplet size. CF
droplet burning is predicted to be absent for large diameter droplets containing more than 50% (by volume)
iso—octane (>PRF50), and for all droplet diameters that exhibit hot ﬂame burning Without radiative extinc—
tion. The model predictions are in agreement With new, large diameter PRF50 experiments reported here,
as well as previous ground—based PRF50 sub—millimeter diameter experiments. The effects of PRF mixture
fraction are further analyzed numerically. Additional simulations show that replacing small amounts of in—
ert (nitrogen) With ozone can sufﬁciently modify the low temperature kinetic activity of PRF50 droplets
to promote CF droplet burning, even for sub—millimeter droplet diameters (With no hot ﬂame transition).
The implications are that With proper experimental conﬁgurations, CF droplet burning might be studied in
ground—based, sub—millimeter diameter, isolated droplet burning experiments.
