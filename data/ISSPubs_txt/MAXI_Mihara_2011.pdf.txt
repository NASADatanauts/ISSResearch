to achieve the highest sensitivity among the all—sky X—
ray monitors built so far. It employs large—area position—
sensitive proportional counters With a total detector area
of 5350 cm2 and the slit and slat collimators deﬁning
two rectangular FOVS of 1.50(FWHM) X 1600 to optimize
the monitoring of relatively faint sources including AGNS.
The on—board data processor (DP) has functions to for—
mat telemetry data for the two download paths different
in the bandwidth and to protect the gas counters from
particle irradiation in orbit. The ground calibration tests
conﬁrmed the effective area in the energy band of 2—30
keV, the energy resolution of 16% (FWHM) at 6 keV,
the energy response in the limited proportionality region,
