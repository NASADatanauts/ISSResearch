Abstract: A total of thirty—one samples were included in the National Aeronautics and Space Adminis—
tration (NASA) Glenn Research Center (GRC) Polymer Film Thermal Control (PFTC) and Gossamer
Materials experiments, which were exposed to the low Earth orbit environment for nearly 4 years 011 the
exterior of the International Space Station (188) as part Of the Materials International Space Station EX—
periment (MISSE 1 and MISSE 2). This paper describes objectives, materials, and Characterizations for
the MISSE 1 and MISSE 2 GRC PFTC and Gossamer Materials samples. Samples included films of
polyimides, ﬂuorinated polyimides, and Teﬂon® ﬂuorinated ethylene propylene (FEP) with and with—
out second—surface metalized layers and/or surface coatings. Films of polyphenylene benzobisoxazole
(PEG) and a polyarylene ether benzimidazole (TOR—LMTM) were also included. Polymer film samples
were examined post—ﬂight for Changes in mechanical and Optical properties. The environment in which
the samples were located was Characterized through analysis Of sapphire contamination witness samples
and samples dedicated to atomic oxygen (A0) erosion measurements. Results Of the analyses of the PFTC
and Gossamer Materials experiments are discussed.

vulnerable to the degrading effects of the space environment. Space environmental effects
that can cause damage to polymers include solar ultraviolet radiation, solar ﬂare X-rays,
solar wind electrons and protons trapped in Earth’s magnetic field, temperature and orbital
thermal cycling effects, micrometeoroids and orbital debris, and low Earth orbit atomic
oxygen (A0). Examples of these degrading effects on spacecraft polymers are described
in detail by Dever et al. [1]. For thermal control applications, it is important to understand
space environment effects on optical properties. For applications where polymer films
are “free standing,” it is additionally important to understand space environment effects
on mechanical properties. NASA Glenn Research Center developed two experiments, the
Polymer Film Thermal Control (PFTC) Experiment and the Gossamer Materials Experi-
ment, which were included on MISSE 1 and MISSE 2, in order to examine long-duration
space environment effects on optical and mechanical properties of polymer films. Sam-
ples on these experiments included commonly-used thermal control polymer materials
and other various thin polymer films with and without coatings. Together, the PFTC and
Gossamer Materials Experiments on MISSE 1 and MISSE 2 provided samples of fourteen
materials for examining optical properties, ten samples for examining mechanical proper-
ties, four samples dedicated to examining the atomic oxygen exposure environment, and
three contamination witness samples. The development of these experiments is described
by Dever et al. [2].

On August 16, 2001, as part of the STS-105 Space Shuttle mission, astronauts in-
stalled the MISSE 1 and MISSE 2 passive experiment carriers (PECs) on the exterior of
the International Space Station (188) Quest Airlock. The MISSE 1 and MISSE 2 PECs
installed on the 188 are shown in figure 1. Each of the PEC “suitcases” contained two
exposure faces or “trays”. When the suitcases were opened and installed onto the 188,
each PEC had one face (tray) which was nominally exposed in the ram-facing direction
(receiving A0) and one which was nominally facing the wake direction (intended to not
receive A0). The GRC PFTC samples were located on the nominally ram trays and the
Gossamer Materials samples were located on the nominally wake trays. MISSE 1 and
MISSE 2 were exposed to the space environment for nearly 4 years. On July 30, 2005,
as part of the STS-114 Shuttle mission, astronauts retrieved the MISSE 1 and MISSE 2
PECs. Experiments were de-integrated from the MISSE 1 and MISSE 2 PECs at NASA
Langley Research Center in October 2005 and returned to investigators for analysis. The
analyses of the GRC PFTC and Gossamer Materials Experiments on MISSE 1 and MISSE
2 are described in this paper.

2. MISSE 1 AND MISSE 2 ENVIRONMENT DESCRIPTION

The atomic oxygen environment for the MISSE 2 PFTC samples and Gossamer Materials

samples is described in the “AO erosion” section of this paper. Estimated environmental

conditions of solar exposure, tray temperatures, and ionizing radiation doses on MISSE 1

and MISSE 2 were provided by G. Pippin [3] from which solar exposure equivalent sun

hours (ESH) are summarized in table 1. The total ESH in table 1 includes Earth-reﬂected

2 was determined from on-orbit measurements to be nominally between +40 and —30 0C
with a total of approximately 22 800 thermal cycles [3]. Data 011 the ionizing radiation

through 127 ,um Kapton (for MISSE 1) and approximately 26 krads(Si) through 51 ,um
aluminum (for MISSE 2).

3. EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURES
3.1. Description ofsamples
Polymers included in the PFTC and Gossamer Materials experiments are described in
table 2, and coatings are described in table 3. For coatings with multiple layers, table 3
indicates coating layers separated by a “/” in order from Closest to farthest from the front,
or space-facing, surface. Table 4 lists all samples included in the MISSE l and MISSE 2
GRC PFTC and Gossamer Materials experiments. For polymers with coatings, the mate-
rial descriptions in table 4 indicate the various layers from the front space-facing surface
to the back surface in the following format: front surface coating(s) if used/polymer/back
surface coating(s). Table 4 also indicates the PEC (MISSE l or MISSE 2), the exposure
tray (nominally ram-facing “AD” or nominally wake-facing “non-AO”), the sample holder
and location within the holder, and the various analyses performed for each sample. Note
that the full serial number for each sample is indicated as: holder label-position in holder.
The analysis techniques used for the PFTC and Gossamer Materials samples included
mechanical (tensile) properties measurements, optical properties measurements, atomic
oxygen erosion measurements, and contamination analysis of witness windows. As it is
hoped to use some of the data from the PFTC experiment to make predictions of dura-
bility of these materials for geosynchronous and other orbital environments that do not
contain AO, some samples contained the transparent silicon oXide/Teﬂon® (SiOX/PTFE)
AO-resistant coating (described in table 3) in an effort to eliminate AO effects but still
allow penetration of solar ultraviolet and ionizing radiation. Gossamer Materials samples
were located on “non-AO” trays, also in an effort to assess effects of space exposure on
materials relevant to non-AO environments.

Tensile test samples, listed in table 4, were fabricated using a die manufactured aC-
Cording to specimen “Type V” under the American Society for Testing and Materials
(ASTM) Standard D-638 [4]. This dog-bone-shaped die provided the smallest specimen
size consistent with this ASTM standard with a gage length of 7.62 mm, and a gage width
of 3.18 mm. In order to occupy the least area possible on the MISSE trays, tensile spec-
imen holders were designed and fabricated to allow the gage area of samples to receive

shows pre-ﬂight photographs of the two five-sample holders used for MISSE 1 tensile
specimens, and figure 3 shows an end-on schematic View of a sample loaded in the tensile
specimen holder. In order to have enough sample length to grip the ends once the sample
was wound through the holder, the tensile specimen die was used so that it did not cut
through the grip ends. The grip ends were cut to a longer length than provided by the die.
Once tensile samples were loaded into the holders, excess grip ends were trimmed.
Samples for optical properties measurements and for erosion yield measurements
were cut using a punch with an inner diameter of approximately 2.530 cm that produced
samples of approximately 2.565 cm diameter. Atomic oxygen erosion yield samples typ-
ically included several layers of polymer film material to allow for remaining material at
the end of the mission to accurately measure total mass loss. The numbers of layers in-
cluded in each stack are indicated in table 4. Where multiple layers were included, each
sample stack was comprised of a top stack and an underlying stack which were weighed
separately. Polished sapphire (A1203) windows of 2.52 cm diameter and 1.588 mm thick
were included among samples 011 the AO-facing and “non-AO” facing trays as indicated in

ultimate tensile strength, and elongation to failure. Samples were installed with an initial
grip separation distance of 2.54 cm. Elongation was determined based on the Change in
distance between the grips from test start to break. A test speed of 12.7 mm min‘1 was
used.

were made using a Perkin-Elmer Lambda—l9 spectrophotometer equipped with a 15 cm
integrating sphere. Solar absorptance, a, was obtained from the spectral reﬂectance and
transmittance data according to standard methods [5].

Thermal emittance (obtained for non-transmitting samples only) was obtained using
an SOC—400t, manufactured by the Surface Optics Corporation. This instrument measures
hemispherically detected spectral reﬂectance over the wavelength range 2—25 ,um. Room
temperature hemispherical emittance was obtained from the spectral data and the room
temperature blackbody distribution using methods described by J aworske and Skowronski
[6].

3.4. A0 erosion measurements
The calculation for erosion yield of a material is shown in equation (1):
Am

— = E (l)

A pF
where Am is the mass loss (g); A is the exposure area (cmz); ,0 is the material den-
sity (g cm‘3); F is the atomic oxygen ﬂuence (atoms cm‘z); and E is the erosion yield
(cm3 atom‘l).

Equation (1) can also be used to calculate AO ﬂuence, F , based on the measured mass
loss of a material with a known erosion yield, E. Included among the PFTC AO erosion
samples was Kapton® H, with a well-known erosion yield of 3 x 10‘24 cm3 atom‘l, as de-
scribed by Dever et al. [1]. This sample was used to determine mission AO ﬂuence for the
PFTC samples. Table 4 indicates AO erosion specimens included in the MISSE 2 PFTC
Experiment. Due to their high erosion yield, and thus, the anticipated loss of significant
material thickness, polyimide AO specimens were comprised of stacked layers. For each
sample, table 4 indicates the number of layers included for the erosion yield sample stacks.
It was important to include enough layers in each sample stack in order to ensure that sam-
ples would not be completely eroded during the MISSE l and 2 mission duration. Use of
two separately weighed stacks for each of the erosion yield samples was intended to al-
low for greater sensitivity in the mass measurements, because the underlying stack, which
served as contingency in the event of delayed retrieval of the experiment, would not have
been weighed if its layers were not eroded. Despite the longer—than-planned mission dura-
tion (~4 years), all of the AO erosion specimens had enough material in order for erosion
measurements to be made. The contingency underlying stack experienced some erosion
and was included as part of the mass measurement for each sample stack.

Pre-ﬂight and post-ﬂight mass measurements were obtained for the PFTC AO erosion
samples using a Mettler Model M3 microgram balance. For both pre-ﬂight and post—ﬂight
mass measurements, AO erosion samples were placed in vacuum desiccators at a pressure
of approximately 13.3 Pa or less for at least 6 days to ensure full dehydration. Samples
were removed from the desiccator one at a time, following the same weighing order for
both pre-ﬂight and post—ﬂight mass measurements. While each sample was being mea-

sured, the remaining samples to be weighed were returned to the desiccator and kept
under vacuum.
3.5. Contamination witness window characterizations
The three aluminum oxide (A1203) witness windows, two of which were included 011
the MISSE 2 AO-facing tray and one which was included 011 the MISSE 2 “ncn-AO”
tray, as indicated in table 4, were designated for contamination analysis. Samples were
analyzed using X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and profilcmetry to determine
the chemistry and thickness of deposited contaminants. The XPS analysis was performed
with a Surface Science Labs SSX- 100 XPS spectrometer. The base pressure in the analysis
chamber was 8 x 10‘8 Pa. The SSX-lOO uses a monochromatic aluminum X-ray source.
A nominal X-ray spot size of 600 mm was selected for this analysis. This instrument
has a hemispherical electron energy analyzer and a positicn-sensitive detector with a mi-
crochannel plate. A pass energy of 50 eV was used for the high resolution XPS scans. A
Tenccr Alpha Step 200 profilcmeter was used to determine the step height between the
masked (unexposed) area and the exposed area of the measured sample.
4. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
4.1. Initial observations
In October 2005, sample holders were de-integrated from the MISSE 1 and MISSE 2
trays at Langley Research Center in Hampton, Virginia. Prior to de-integraticn, experi-
menters were able to obtain photographs of their sample holders. Figures 5(a) and (b)
shows the GRC PFTC and Gossamer Materials tensile sample holders 1-Q1 and 2-Q2,
respectively, prior to de-integraticn. The most notable Observations for the tensile speci-
mens were breakage of the following specimens: SiOX-PTFE/CPl/VDA (1-Q1-1), SiOX-
PTFE/Kaptcn HN/VDA (1-Q1-2) and Kaptcn HN/VDA (2-Q2-2). Additionally, the PEG
film sample (2-Q2-4) was mostly gone, except for a small amount of material remaining
at the grip area. The SiOX-PTFE coatings on samples 1-Q1-1 and 1-Q1-2 appear to have
cracked, resulting in atomic oxygen erosion through the 25.4 mm sample thickness in the
areas where the coating was cracked. Furthermore, although holder 2-Q2 was 011 a tray
which was not intended to receive atomic oxygen, it was discovered that maneuvers 0f the
188 during MISSE 1 and 2 exposure resulted in some atomic oxygen exposure of these
samples. The 25.4 mm thick Kaptcn HN sample 2-Q2-2 broke in thinned areas due to this
AO erosion. Additionally, sample 2-Q2-3, UpileX S/VDA, broke upon attempted removal
from its sample holder, because it had become extremely delicate and thinned in areas due
to atomic oxygen erosion. These five damaged/brcken materials could not be analyzed
for measurement of mechanical properties of the bulk material. As the intended purpose

Among the MISSE 2 samples for optical properties measurement, it was noted that
2-E6-20 (SiOX-PTFE/CPI/VDA) had experienced significant perforation along a prefer-
ential direction across the sample, and furthermore, it had also become perforated at the
edge of the sample holder. This failure may have been the result of the SiOX-PTFE coating
failure, allowing atomic oxygen erosion, but further investigation is required to determine
the actual cause(s). The ﬂight sample, compared to a pristine control, is shown in figure 6.
Another notable Change was in sample 2-E6-23, 38.1 mm TOR LM. It had undergone
significant darkening as a result of the 4-year exposure, as shown in figure 7.
4.2. Mechanical properties
Mechanical properties are shown in table 5 for the tensile test samples which were intact
post-ﬂight. For the MISSE 1, l-Ql (AO-facing) samples, each of the three tested samples
experienced a similar reduction in ultimate tensile strength (UTS) and percentage elonga-
tion in comparison with the pristine control specimens. Samples experienced a reduction
in UTS of between 30 and 36% and a reduction in elongation of between 68 and 78%, indi-
cating significant degradation of the polymer materials. The 2-Q2 (“non-AO”) FEP/VDA
sample 10st approximately 23% of its tensile strength and 85% of its elongation, indi-

4.3. Optical properties
Tables 6 and 7 show optical properties Changes for the MISSE 2 PFTC samples (2—E6
holder) and Gossamer Materials samples (1-E10 holder), respectively. Among samples
on the MISSE 2 AO-facing 2-E6 Holder, FEP samples and Kapton HN samples showed
relatively minor Changes in solar absorptanee. As shown in table 6, the uncoated 5 mil
FEP/VDA sample on the MISSE 2 A0 exposure tray experienced a significant decrease
in thermal emittance, a likely result of atomic oxygen erosion which had caused a loss
in FEP thickness for this unprotected sample. Among samples on the AO-facing 2—E6
holder, the most significant increase in solar absorptance was for the TOR LM material
(Aa ~ 0.15), which had undergone significant Visible darkening, as shown in figure 7.

some atomic oxygen exposure to these nominally “non-AO” trays. Furthermore, note that
no optical properties are given for the PEG sample, 1-E10-36, because the sample was
completely eroded/degraded pcst-ﬂight.
4.4. A0 erosion
AO erosion data is summarized in table 8. The MISSE 2 A0 mission ﬂuence was
calculated based on the 2-E6-17 Kaptcn H sample stack. This mission ﬂuence of
8.51 x 1021 atoms cm‘2 was used in the calculation of erosion yields for UpileX S,
CPI, Kaptcn HN and FEP samples included 011 the MISSE 2, 2-E6 holder. These cal-
culations used density values obtained from density gradient column measurements as
described by de Grch et al. [7]. Although AO exposure was not intended for the MISSE
2, Tray 2 materials, samples in holder 1-E10 were observed to be AO eroded, due to
maneuvers 0f the 188, which caused these surfaces to face the ram AO direction for a
period of time. The Kaptcn HN sample in the 1-E10 holder was weighed pcst-ﬂight and
its mass was compared with that of two pristine control samples which were punched
at the same time using the same punch from the same stock material. In this way, the
atomic oxygen ﬂuence experienced by the MISSE 2, “non-AO” tray was estimated to be
1.99 x 1020 atoms cm‘z, which was approximately 2% 0f the ﬂuence experienced by the
AO-facing tray.
4.5. Contamination
The results of the contamination analysis of MISSE 2 sapphire (A1203) witness windows
are shown in table 9. The silica contaminant layer thickness, t in table 9, was calculated
assuming a uniform overlayer of silica 0n the sapphire (A1203) windows and following a
formula described by Wang et al. [8]. If R is the ratio of A1 2p t0 Si 2p intensities, then:
R = R* [exp (—tVZ/i) / (1 — exp (_t\/2//1>>]' (2)

In equation (2), t is the silica overlayer thickness; 2 is the inelastic mean free path
of the A1 2p photoelectron in the silica overlayer; and R* is the ratio of clean A1203 2p
intensity to the Si 2p intensity for a silica layer > 3 2 thick. The value of x1 for the 1400 eV
A1 2p photoelectron in SiOz is taken from the calculation by Powell and J ablonski [9] to
be 3.7 nm. Equation (2) can be solved for t, which gives

T=—/1\/2/—21n(R/ (R+R*)). (3)

The value of R* can be determined from the slope of a linear fit of a plot of the Si 2p
and A1 2p intensities. Figure 8 shows that a value of R* = 0.452 was calculated.

Silica contaminant thicknesses, t, for the MISSE 2 sapphire windows were estimated
using equation (3). It should be noted that the presence of other contaminants, including
hydrocarbons and ﬂuorine compounds, contributes to the uncertainty in the calculated
thickness. In fact, profilometry of the 1-E10—2 sample has indicated a total contaminant
layer thickness of 25 nm, in comparison with the calculated silica layer thickness, which
was > 10 nm as reported in table 9. Based on the data in table 9, it is evident that a
significantly thicker layer of silica contamination was deposited on the sapphire window
located on the “non-AO” MISSE 2 tray in comparison with those on the AO-facing MISSE
2 tray. Furthermore, the trace ﬂuorine contaminants observed on the AO-facing sapphire
windows were not observed on the “non-AO” sapphire windows.

5. SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS

Analyses have been conducted on the NASA GRC Polymer Film Thermal Control and

Gossamer Materials Experiments ﬂown for nearly 4 years on MISSE 1 and MISSE 2. The

(ram) direction and a tray which nominally faced the non-AO (wake) direction. The GRC
experiments described in this paper contained samples on each tray. Optical properties
specimens ﬂown on the MISSE 2 experiment indicated minor solar absorptance increases
for FEP and SiOX-PTFE coated Kapton HN materials (Aa < 0.02), moderate increases
for Ge-coated Black Kapton, UpileX S and CPI materials (Aa ~ 0.04 to 0.05), and a
significant increase (Aa ~ 0.15) for TOR LM. Whereas the SiOX-PTFE coated Kapton
HN material underwent a negligible solar absorptance increase (Aa = 0.007), an uncoated
Kapton HN sample experienced a moderate solar absorptance increase (Aa ~ 0.05). A11
uncoated polymer film samples experienced a decrease in thermal emittance, consistent
with reduced thickness of the polymer due to atomic oxygen erosion.

Tensile specimens ﬂown on the MISSE 1 AO-facing and “non-AO” trays have indi-
cated significant degradation in mechanical properties of Teﬂon FEP, Kapton HN and Up-
ileX S polymer film materials. A CPl/VDA polymer film sample ﬂown on the “non-AO”
side of MISSE 1 showed only minor Changes in mechanical properties in comparison with
the pristine controls. Measurements of mass loss of a Kapton HN film sample located on
the MISSE 2 “non-AO” tray indicated AO ﬂuence on this tray of ~2 x 1020 atoms cm‘z,
which was roughly 2% of the AO ﬂuence measured on the nominally ram AO-faoing tray
(8.51 x 1021 atoms cm‘z). Contamination deposited onto the sapphire witness windows
was analyzed for samples ﬂown on MISSE 2 on both the A0 and “non-AO” facing trays.
