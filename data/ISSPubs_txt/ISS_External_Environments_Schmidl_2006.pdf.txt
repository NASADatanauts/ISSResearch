Abstract: The International Space Station (188) and Orbiter dump water overboard. This
water is from the ISS condensate system, and from the Orbiter’s fuel cell
(supply side) and wastewater (urine and condensate) systems. When water is
dumped into a vacuum, some of it ﬂashes into a vapor. The expanding vapor
bursts the stream into vapor, and small and large liquid/ice particles. The large
liquid/ice particles are approximately 2 mm in diameter and have nominal
velocities of approximately 31 ﬁ/sec (U.S. Lab) and 50 ft/sec (Orbiter). As
these liquid/ice particles impact, they may cause mechanical damage due to
erosion/pitting of sensitive surfaces, including Solar Array or radiator surfaces.
Solar Arrays are of particular concern because of the thin optical coatings on
the surface of the cells. The thickness of these coatings is 43300 Angstroms.
Damage to these coatings can cause degradation of the cells’ optical
characteristics that can potentially reduce performance and shorten the life of g
the cells. To mitigate damage from water dumps, the characteristics of the
water dumps were studied and the results used to develop the constraints
needed to mitigate damage to 188 hardware from US. Lab and Orbiter water
dumps.

Key words: Water dump, vent, purge, impact, damage, erosion, pitting

1. INTRODUCTION

The International Space Station (188) and Orbiter dump water overboard

into space. The phenomena of releasing water into a vacuum has been

studied for many years (Fuchs eta]. 1979, Kofsky eta]. 1992, Mikatarian

and Anderson, 1964). F igure 1 shows a schematic of water dumping into a

vacuum. It is known that as the liquid exits the nozzle it freezes. Then the

expanding gas bubbles burst the stream into vapor, and small and large
liquid/ice particles that can travel in various directions.

When water is dumped overboard, there is a concern that direct contact
from the liquid/ice particles on 188 hardware can cause mechanical damage
to sensitive surfaces due to erosion/pitting of those surfaces. Solar Arrays are
of particular concern because of the thin optical coatings on the surface of
the Solar cells. The thickness of these coatings is 43300 Angstroms. Damage
to these coatings can cause degradation of the Solar cells’ optical
characteristics that can potentially reduce performance and shorten the life of
the Solar cells.

To mitigate potential damage from water dumps, a methodology was
developed that could be used to develop the constraints needed to protect
ISS sensitive surfaces. To develop the methodology, the characteristics of
water dumps were studied and based on the results, constraints were
developed to deﬁne the select angles that the ISS Solar Arrays can be parked
at to preclude damage to Solar Array and radiator surfaces.

2. CHARACTERISTICS OF WATER DUMPS .
2.1 U.S. Lab Water Dumps

Condensate is produced aboard the ISS by the thermal heating and
cooling system and stored in a tank that must eventually be emptied. The '
tank is ﬁll restricted to 100 lbm (60.35% of capacity) to prevent hard—ﬁlling
the tank and to maximize the tank bellows’ life. The US. Lab condensate
system dumps the excess water at cabin pressure (14.7 psi) and with a mass
ﬂow rate that is approximately 14.6 g/s.

The condensate system dumps the excess water overboard through
nozzles located on the US. Lab forward end—cone. These nozzles are located
on the port—zenith side, and starboard-nadir sides and have a diameter of 1.4
mm. Each nozzle is pre-heated to 120° C and heated while dumping to keep
ice from forming close to the nozzle exit that could result in clogging the
nozzle, forming an icicle, or diverting the dump stream. Figure 2 shows the
relative position of the condensate dump nozzles and their direction. The
plume from the nozzles is directed 37.40 from the zenith and nadir directions.

The ﬂight experiment SDTO l6004-A, performed on Sept. 7, 2001, was
to video a condensate dump using the ISS robotic arm, the Space Station

"

Remote Manipulator System (SSRMS) and to measure the characteristics of
the US. Lab water dump (Schmidl et.al. 2002, 2003a, 2003b). The images
were captured using the SSRMS cameras of both the port and starboard
dumps.
The SDTO measurements included the plume cone angle, velocity of the
large liquid/ice particles, and the duration of each of the dump phases.
F igure 3 shows the distinct dump phases that were observed in the SDTO
video. The phases observed were a startup, steady state, and shutdown phase.
The startup phase occurs when the line valve is opened and the liquid ﬁrst
moves into the lower pressure environment. The steady state phase occurs
for the majority of the dumping duration. The liquid is conﬁned to a narrow
directed cone. It lasts for the remainder of the dump, excluding the startup
and shutdown phases. The shutdown phase occurs when gas becomes
entrained in the condensate water being dumped. The shutdown phase was
also divided into an initial shutdown phase and a sputtering shutdown phase.
The initial shutdown phase occurs when gas becomes entrained in the
condensate tank and the valve is still open. The shutdown sputtering phase
occurs after the valve is closed.
The plume cone angles were measured from the centerline for each of the
dump phases. It was observed that the plume had a core region where the
majority of the liquid/ice particles were concentrated; however, some
particles were also observed outside the core region. For SDTO 16004-A,
~145 particles were ejected outside the core region. _
In ﬁgure 3, it can be observed that the steady state phase has a tight cone. é
The startup and shutdown phases, at the beginning and end of the dump -
event, have large cone angles. This is due to the bursting of the stream. The
plume cone angle for the steady state phase was measured to be 10°.
However, for engineering margin, the plume cone angle for the steady state
phase was deﬁned to be 20°. For the startup and shutdown phases, the plume
cone angle was deﬁned to be 60°.
Figure 4 shows the angular distribution function that was developed for
each of the phases observed during SDTO 16004-A. For the startup,
shutdown initial, and shutdown sputtering phases, the distribution is ﬂat to
account for the larger plume cone angle that was observed. Figure 4b shows
the angular distribution function for the steady state phase. It can be seen
that the majority of large particles is concentrated near the plume centerline .

dump, they could rotate directly into the impact zone with engineering
margin of the water dump.

For each vent phase of SDTO 16004-A, the liquid/ice particle velocities
were measured both outside and inside the core region of the plume. For the
startup phase, velocities measured outside the 60° core region ranged from
5.8 to 15 ft/sec (measured velocities including the core region ranged from
2.8 to 30.6 ft/sec). For the steady state phase (core region within 20°), from
average ﬂow rate and nozzle diameter, the average velocity was determined
to be 31 ft/sec. For the initial shutdown phase, measured velocities outside
the core region ranged from 2.0 to 3.3 ft/sec (measured velocities including
the core region ranged from 2.0 to 8.0 ft/sec). For the shutdown sputtering
phase, measured velocities outside the 60° core region ranged from 2.0 to 4.6
ft/sec (measured velocities including the core region ranged from 1.5 to 9.1
ft/sec).

The phase durations for the SDTO l6004-A dump, as shown in ﬁgure 3,
were determined from the video by the NASA Imaging Science and Analysis
Group (IS&AG). The startup phase took approximately 36 seconds, the
initial shutdown phase took approximately 22 seconds, and the shutdown
sputtering phase took approximately 32 seconds. The steady state phase
lasted for the remainder of the dump, which for this experiment (SDTO
l6004-A), lasted ~5 64 sec.

2.2 Orbiter Water Dumps

The Orbiter dumps both waste water (urine and condensate) and supply 5
water. Supply water is generated by the Orbiter’s fuel cells and is extremely
pure, so it is not a molecular deposition concern. The condensate water is
collected from the Orbiter cabin and has approximately 0.004 % non—volatile
residues in the water. So, it does not leave a signiﬁcant deposit. Pure urine
Contains approximately 4% residue and is a deposition concern. To protect
the solar cells from urine deposits, the Solar Arrays are feathered so that
only the backside is hit. The feathering angles deﬁned to protect against
erosion/pitting will also mitigate deposition concerns.

Flight rules are currently in place to minimize urine dumps. To minimize
urine dumps, urine and condensate water are separated, and the condensate
water is stored in contingency water containers (CWCs). Only urine in
excess of the tank capacity is dumped overboard. All urine dumping is to be

discontinued when the Japanese hardware goes up, because it is in the direct
line of sight of the Orbiter vent nozzles.

Water released from the Orbiter is dumped through two nozzles located
close to each other on the Orbiter’s port side and are directed to the port side
of ISS. One nozzle is for supply side water and the other is for wastewater.
The nozzles are 1.4 mm in diameter. Water released from each nozzle is
dumped at 31 psia at 23.7 g/sec.

The concern for Orbiter water dumps is with sensitive hardware on the
port side of ISS. F igure 6 shows a schematic of the direction of the Orbiter
dump for 188 assembly complete.

F igure 7 shows an' image of the Orbiter dumping water. The inset ﬁgure
was captured from a video of the Orbiter water dump.

The Boeing external contamination team developed a model for the
Orbiter water dump (Alred, et.a1., 1998). F igure 8 shows the plume
distribution for that model. It can be seen that the majority of large particles
is concentrated near the centerline of the plume out to 10°. This region is
deﬁned as the impact zone. The 188 External Contamination Team deﬁned
the cone out to 20° from the plume centerline as the impact zone with -
engineering margin.

F igure 9 shows the ﬁeld of view from the Orbiter dump nozzles for 188
assembly complete. Sensitive surfaces of concern are the Japanese
Aerospace Exploration Agency (JAXA) payload sites and the P4/P6 s;
radiators and Solar Arrays. The JAXA payload sites can be seen just below
the center of the plume. It can be seen that if the Solar Array is not feathered,
it will be impacted broadside. In this conﬁguration, the radiator is rotated out
of the ﬁeld of view. As will be shown later, the Solar Arrays should be
feathered so that the impacts occur on the backside of the array and at a
shallow (15°) angle. ‘

The Arnold Engineering Development Center (AEDC) measured the
characteristics of the Orbiter water dump. These measured characteristics
include the Orbiter water dump plume cone angle, the composition of the
plume (the fractions of vapor/ small particles/ large particles), and the
velocity of the large particles. The results from the AEDC ground tests have
been compared with ﬂight images and an Orbiter dump model was
developed (Alred, et. a1. 1998). The results show that the velocity of the
particles is nominally 50 ft/sec and the plume cone angle is 10°.

3. DAMAGE MITIGATION
SPHINX is an impact code developed at the Los Alamos National
' Laboratory (LANL) (Wingate and Stellingwerf, 1993, Stellingwerf and
Wingate, 1993, Alred et. a1., 2003). SPHINX uses smooth particle
hydrodynamics (SPH) to simulate impact phenomena. SPHINX has been
applied, in the past, to modelling thruster droplet impacts onto sensitive
surfaces to develop the appropriate feathering angles for the Solar Arrays
(Alred et. a1. 2003). The results from these studies showed that direct
impacts normal to the surface would damage the solar cells. Impacts at a
shallow angle to the surface of less than 15° (or 75° from the surface normal) ”
did not show any damage to the solar cells.

Using these results as a starting point, the constraints for liquid/ice
particle impacts were developed. Although, the results did not show any
damage to the solar cell, the UVE protective coating is thin, 43300
Angstroms. If the coating is damaged it degrades the performance and ‘
lifetime of the solar cell. To be conservative, it was determined that the
operational constraint will be to not allow impacts onto the active side.

The backside of the Solar Array has a 1300 Angstrom SIOx coating to
protect the kapton backing from atomic oxygen erosion. Below the kapton,
there are additional layers that if lost will not affect the performance of the
solar cell. However, to minimize damage to the Solar Array, the operational
constraint developed for the backside of the Solar Array is that impacts will
be at a shallow angle, less than 15° to the surface. ,

In addition, to minimize the number of impacts, an operational constraint
was developed so that the Solar Arrays will be rotated to remain outside the
impact zone with engineering margin (the 20° half cone angle cone around
the plume centerline).

To mitigate damage to the Solar Array photovoltaic radiators (PVR), an
operational constraint was developed to keep the radiators away from the
plume centerline. The radiators operate cold and cannot be feathered. In
addition, the effect of liquid/ice particle impacts on the radiators has not
been well deﬁned yet. The constraint is to keep a Solar Array between the
impact zone with engineering margin and the radiator. This constraint will
allow the radiators no closer than 50° to 60° from the plume centerline. ’ '

outside of the impact zone with engineering margin and feathered so that

impacts from the water dump occur on the backside of the arrays.

An example of the feathering angles deﬁned, based on the deﬁned

the liquid/ice particles occur on the backside of the arrays at a shallow angle
is shown in ﬁgure 11. t

4. SUMMARY

The International Space Station (ISS) and Orbiter both dump water
overboard into space. The dumped stream bursts into liquid/ice particles.
The large quuid/ice particles are approximately 2 mm in diameter and have
nominal velocities of approximately 31 ft/sec (U.S. Lab) and 50 ft/sec
(Orbiter). As these liquid/ice particles impact, they can cause mechanical
damage due to erosion/pitting of sensitive surfaces, such as the coatings used
on the Solar Array or radiator surfaces. Solar Arrays are of particular
concern because of the thin optical coatings on the surface of the cells.
Damage to these coatings can cause degradation of the cells’ performance
and operational lifetime.

To mitigate damage from water dumps, the characteristics of the water
dumps were studied. The results were used to develop the constraints needed
to mitigate damage to ISS hardware from the US. Lab and Orbiter water
dumps. The results of these studies show that the ISS Solar Arrays can be
parked at select angles during water dump operations to preclude damage to
the Solar Array and radiator surfaces.
