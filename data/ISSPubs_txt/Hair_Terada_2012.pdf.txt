and magnesium (Mg) levels were 55.2% and 20.4% lower, respectively, in the experi—
mental group (P< 0.05 in both cases).
These results indicate that a physiological change in mineral metabolism resulting
from physical or mental stress, such as hindlimb suspension, is reﬂected in body hair.
The Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency (JAXA) has initiated a human research study to
investigate the effects of long—term space ﬂight on gene expression and mineral
metabolism by analyzing hair samples of astronauts who stayed in the International
Space Station (ISS) for 6 months. We believe that hindlimb suspension for 14 days can
simulate the effects of an extremely severe environment, such as space ﬂight, because
the hindlimb suspension model elicits a rapid physiological change in skeletal muscle,
bone, and ﬂuid shift even in the short term. These results also suggest that we can
detect various effects on the body by analyzing the human scalp hair shaft.
