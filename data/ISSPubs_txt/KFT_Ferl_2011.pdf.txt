Abstract
Molecular biology experiments on the International Space Station (ISS) continue to face challenges of sample harvesting and sample
return to earth for post ﬂight analysis; however, the use of Kennedy Space Center Fixation Tubes ﬁlled With RNALater has proven to be
a robust solution to many of these challenges. While it is clear that one direction of future spaceﬂight experimentation may be towards
enhanced on—orbit analytical capabilities, the rapid progress of earth—bound analytical capacity dictates that facile return of molecular
biology samples from the ISS Will continue to be a mainstay of space life sciences research and ﬂight operations. In this paper we present
a case study of the successful performance of KFTs and RNALater over a broad set of operational conditions of ascent conﬁguration,
on—orbit experiment use, on—orbit storage and sample return conﬁgurations that are unique to ISS current operations and constraints. We
also provide observations on performance limits and discuss deployment opportunities and scenarios that are consistent With continued
successful ISS molecular biology experimentation.

CWRW KFTs that were subsequently made available to the TAGES experiment were launched on STS-123 and therefore had a loiter time of nearly two
years on orbit before use. The loiter time on orbit for the TAGES KFTs launched on STS-129 and STS-130 ranged from a few days to several months.
After the experiment activities and sample collection, the loiter time for samples frozen in RNALater KFTs in MELFI on orbit ranged from a few days to
two months.

crux of the orbital activities of the experiment, where samples are harvested, placed into KFTs and stored in RNALater. (A) KFTs were deployed around
