Abstract
There have been ﬁve Materials International Space Station Experiment (MISSE) passive experiment
carriers (PECs) (MISSE 1-5) to date that have been launched, exposed in space on the exterior of
International Space Station (188) and then returned to Earth for analysis. An additional four MISSE PECs
(MISSE 6A, 6B, 7A, and 7B) are in various stages of completion. The PECs are tWO-sided suitcase to size
sample carriers that are intended to provide information on the effects of the low Earth orbital
environment on a Wide variety of materials and components. As a result of post retrieval analyses of the
retrieved MISSE 2 experiments and numerous prior space experiments, there have been valuable lessons
learned and needs identiﬁed that are worthy of being documented so that planning, design, and analysis of
future space environment experiments can beneﬁt from the experience in order to maximize the
knowledge gained. Some of the lessons learned involve the techniques, concepts, and issues associated
With measuring atomic oxygen erosion yields. These are presented along With several issues to be
considered When designing experiments, such as the uncertainty in mission duration, scattering and
contamination effects on results, and the accuracy of measuring atomic oxygen erosion.
Introduction
This paper represents a collection of lessons learned With respect to atomic oxygen interactions
resulting from a variety of space experiments, as well as retrieved spacecraft materials and components
from NASA’s Long Duration Exposure Facility (LDEF), NASA’s Evaluation of Oxygen Interactions
With Materials-3 (EOIM-3) experiment, the Russian Space Station Mir, NASA’s Materials International
Space Station Experiment 2 (MISSE 2), J apanese Aerospace Exploration Agency’s (JAXA) Service
Module/Miero-Partieles Capturer & Space Environment Exposure Device (SM/MPAC & SEED) ISS
Experiment, and the Hubble Space Telescope (HST). The collective experiences from these low Earth
orbital ﬂights provide useful considerations for those Who plan future experiments that involve atomic
oxygen interaction With materials. The objective of this paper is to explain and capture these experiences
to beneﬁt the quality of future experiments.

"6","Lessons Learned
Written Instructions and Procedures

Written instructions and procedures used for mounting and assembly of space ﬂight hardware are
almost always required but occasionally glossed over by those who are tasked with ﬁnal installation of
hardware that they are not familiar with. It is very difﬁcult to actually know who will be performing such
tasks to be able to properly brief them. An example of this is the author’s experience regarding an
experiment on EOIM-3 involving a pinhole camera. The cover on the experiment contained a small hole
which was to act as a lens for the camera. A written instruction was provided in the installation
instructions for the ﬂight hardware with a warning to “not remove the cover of the Pin Hole Camera
which contains the pinhole,” however, post-ﬂight inspection of the Shuttle cargo bay containing the
experiment revealed that the cover was, in fact, removed prior to ﬂight. When the ﬂight hardware was
removed from the Shuttle bay the cover for the Pin Hole Camera was again attached to the experiment,
hence one might have thought it was on during ﬂight. The experiment was a total failure as a result. Thus,
sometimes, installations and removals are performed on the basis of what seems logical as opposed to
reading instructions. High resolution images of experiments can sometimes be taken just after being
launched which may contribute to validating proper installation. Also pictures taken at various time
intervals can contribute to valuable information as to experiment function and materials degradation.

The lesson learned is that it is important to verify and witness that instructions and procedures are
properly followed.

Duration of Mission Estimates

Space experiments that involve retrieval of experiments frequently are much longer than initially
planned due to a variety of factors that cannot be accurately predicted at the time the experiments are
being developed. Table I lists the planned and actual mission durations for four missions in which
experiment retrievals were accomplished (refs. 1 to 4). The average mission was a factor of 2.63 longer
than initially planned.

TABLE I.—COMPARISON OF PLANNED AND ACTUAL MISSION DURATION
1-04

For NASA Glenn Research Center’s MISSE 2 Polymer Erosion and Contamination Experiment
(PEACE), the principle investigators designed the experiment so that the thickness of the samples used
for atomic oxygen erosion yield testing were a factor of 3 thicker than what was needed to survive the
original planned mission duration (1 year) based on estimated erosion yields. This procedure resulted in
85 percent of the material samples surviving the mission which was 4 times longer than initially planned
(ref. 5).

The lesson learned is to design experiments for surviving a considerably longer duration (3+ times)
than the planned mission duration, to ensure that meaningful results will be obtained even if the mission
is factors longer than planned. For example, stack multiple layers of thin ﬁlm polymers instead of ﬂying a
single layer.

"7","Silicone Contamination Sources and Consequences

Silicones which have not been vacuum stripped frequently contain short chain molecules which are
volatile and are readily transported onto neighboring surfaces. When these contaminated spacecraft
surfaces are exposed to atomic oxygen in low Earth orbit (LEO) the silicones oxidize to form silicates.
There is also a tendency to trap hydrocarbons on the surface during the silicate formation. The resulting
deposit can form an atomic oxygen protective coating that can darken as a result of solar radiation
exposure. Evidence of the consequence of silicone contamination was clearly shown on selected samples
ﬂown on LDEF as shown in ﬁgure 1 where several samples liberated volatile silicones.

In ﬁgure 1, some of the volatile silicones formed deposits on the sample holder plate and
subsequently became oxidized by atomic oxygen in areas where the surface was not shadowed from
atomic oxygen arrival by the samples. The oxides are silicates that stay ﬁxed on the surface only to
darken in the ultraviolet solar illumination. Where the silicone volatiles deposit and are not exposed to
atomic oxygen, they gradually re-evaporate and no darkening results (hence the light boundary to the
right of the samples, shown in the enlarged photo area). These silicate deposits can also shield other
samples from atomic oxygen attack, which can adversely alter the outcome of the experiment.

In November of 1997 Russian cosmonauts removed and retrieved a non-articulating foldable panel
solar array from the Mir core module after 10.4 years in LEO and returned it for an international
cooperative analysis (refs. 6 and 7). The solar array panels included a clad structure of solar cells, ﬁber
glass scrim, cover glasses, optical solar reﬂectors and an open weave organic fabric coated with BF-4
adhesive. Silicone adhesives and thread sutures were used to clad the solar array structure together. Over
time, volatile silicones evolved from thread suture holes surrounding the solar cells on both sides of the
solar array. Figure 2 shows photographs of the resulting silica deposits on the front and back of Mir solar
cells resulting from atomic oxygen oxidization of the silicones that had been transported in the gaseous
phase onto neighboring surfaces. The thick contamination appears as a white diffuse deposit.

Although the solar array did not signiﬁcantly degrade in performance from the silicate contamination,
there was signiﬁcant darkening of the optical solar reﬂector surfaces and neighboring thermal control
white paint surfaces. This solar array technology was also used for the Russian supplied solar array for the
188. Thus, silicone evolution onto surfaces and experiments on 188 from hardware such as this may result
in contamination that could affect atomic oxygen erosion and solar absorptance.

Table II shows the large variation in silicate contamination on surfaces from experiments placed at
different locations on 188. The MISSE PEC 2 had two orders of magnitude less contaminant thickness
than the J apanese JAXA three experiment units (units 1 to 3) (refs. 8 and 9). This is probably due to
differences in the total arrival of silicones based on each experiment’s respective View of and distances to
contaminant sources on 188.

The lesson learned concerning silicone contamination is that one needs to be careful to avoid self
contamination as well as be out of the View of sources of silicone to be sure that atomic oxygen does not
produce silica deposits that can affect erosion yields or cause changes in solar absorptance.

Scattering of Atomic Oxygen

It has long been suspected and predicted that a portion of the atomic oxygen arriving at a surface Will
scatter With partial accommodation from surfaces that the atomic oxygen reacts With, as well as from
nonreactive surfaces (such as most metal oxides) (refs. 10 to 12). However, only recently, has quantiﬁable
scattering data been available from the results of a small scattering chamber ﬂown on MISSE 2. The
experiment consisted of a 2.54 cm diameter scattering chamber containing a $102 coated (on the RAM
facing surface only) polyimide Kapton H disk With a 3.05 mm diameter aperture that allowed atomic

"9","oxygen to enter the chamber and scatter off of an aluminum disk and then react With the Kapton 0n the
bottom of the aperture disk. The bottom of the aperture disk also had many microscopic salt particles
attached, Which served as protective areas from scattered atomic oxygen attack (ﬁg. 3). By washing off
the salt particles and using proﬁlometry, the amount of atomic oxygen erosion was measured as a
function of ejection angle. Although cosine (0r Lambertian) scattering had been expected, the results
indicated that normal incident atomic oxygen scattered in a rather narrow angular distribution, at
approximately 45 o from normal. The scattered atomic oxygen produced a surprisingly high effective
erosion yield Which was 21.8 percent of that of RAM atomic oxygen for Kapton H polyimide as shown in
ﬁgures 4 and 5.

The lesson learned is that atomic oxygen does not scatter in a cosine distribution or in a specular
direction but instead at 45 o from normal for aluminum. This means that one may need to be careful to
consider scattered atomic oxygen erosion of materials depending upon the particular geometry of a
spacecraft.

"
"10","Sample Holder Geometry

The geometry of sample holders can inﬂuence the ﬂux of atomic oxygen impinging upon samples.
The typical MISSE sample trays with chamfered circular apertures can allow atomic oxygen to scatter
from the chamfered surfaces onto the samples, thus locally increasing the ﬂux impinging on the samples
as shown in ﬁgure 6. A consequence of the perimeter scattered atomic oxygen is that the erosion around
the sample perimeter is greater than in the central area. An example of this is shown in ﬁgure 7 for
measurements of the MISSE 2 PEACE polyethylene oxide sample. If the atomic oxygen is arriving off
normal, then there will be a variation in ﬂux concentrations around the perimeter of each sample
depending upon the scattering geometry. As can be seen in ﬁgure 8 two of the MISSE 2 samples peeled
up from their lower left edge. Atomic oxygen was found to be arriving at 8° from normal and coming
from the upper right in the photograph. Thus, there appears to be a greater ﬂux concentration from atomic
oxygen that impinges closer to perpendicular from the chamfered surface.

For the MISSE 2 trays with circular 2.54 cm diameter samples, the chamfer was at 450 and the lip
was 0.763 mm thick. The maximum possible additional ﬂuence for 2.54 in. diameter samples caused by
atomic oxygen scattering would be ~15 percent and, based on the previously discussed scattering
chamber experiments, more likely ~33 percent. Thus, the concern is not relating to a higher average
ﬂuence but rather of sample peeling and potential release prior to full erosion of samples, which could
lead to incorrect erosion yields.

The whole problem of ﬂux concentration and premature peeling could be eliminated if a reverse
chamfer was used on the sample holders which would not allow scattering of atomic oxygen on to the
surface of the samples. A potential disadvantage of this would be the loss of intimate contact at the edge
of the sample for proﬁling purposes, which would not be a concern for mass loss measurements.

The lesson learned is that sample holder chamfers can be a source of ﬂux concentrations, which can
cut out the perimeter of samples, and in some cases cause the samples to roll up or potentially be released
prior to the full erosion of the sample. The problem could be eliminated by using a reverse chamfer on the
sample holder.

Documentation of Orientation of Samples With Respect to Atomic Oxygen RAM Direction
Understanding the exact orientation of atomic oxygen arrival, or arrival of contaminants, can be very
helpful in interpretation of environmental degradation results. Often exact information can be found if one
documents the orientation of samples prior to removal from experiment trays. However, once the samples
have been removed the opportunity to do this is lost. The exact orientation of the MISSE 2 atomic oxygen
scattering chamber lid was documented. This allowed the determination that atomic oxygen had drilled
holes that were 8° off of normal incidence and coming from the upper left of the ﬁgure 8 photograph
(ref. 12). The knowledge of this off-angled atomic oxygen ﬂuX enabled an explanation for the preferential
cutting out of thin samples on the lower left perimeter, as shown in ﬁgure 8, by atomic oxygen scattered
from the lower left chamfer 0n the circular sample holders.
The lesson learned is to either mark samples for orientation or photo—document them to allow their
orientation during ﬂight to be known for post ﬂight analysis.
Duration Between Retrieval and Tensile Testing
The duration of time between retrieval of samples from space and ground laboratory tensile testing
can have a signiﬁcant impact on the elongation-to-failure for ﬂuorinated ethylene propylene (FEP), and
possibly other polymers, that have been exposed to the LEO environment. For example, samples of
0.127 mm thick silvered-FEP (Ag-FEP) retrieved from the wake side (rows 1 and 4) 0f the LDEF in
J anuary 1990, and aluminized-FEP (Al-FEP) from the HST retrieved in December 1993, indicated a
signiﬁcant reduction in elongation-to-failure as time progressed beyond the retrieval dates as shown in
ﬁgure 9 (ref. 13). Samples were taken from near-neighbor locations in both cases.

Figure 9.—Reduction in elongation-to-failure with time after retrieval for FEP (ref. 13).

Ground testing also indicated that storage of FEP samples in vacuum as opposed to air slows the rate
of tensile property degradation (ref. 14). Polymer chain soission is believed to be responsible for the
reduction in elongation-to-failure, and is initiated by the impact of energetic electrons and protons,
combined With thermal exposure (ref. 15). What is unique is that the reduction in elongation-to-failure
appears to continue long after the radiation damaging exposure occurs. The latent damage in
ﬂuoropolymers is thought to be caused by the formation and presence of long-lived free radicals (refs. 16
and 17). Storing samples in air or exposure to elevated temperatures increases degradation rates as
compared to storage in vacuum or low temperature exposures (ref. 18).

The lesson learned is that to properly evaluate radiation induced tensile property damage in thin ﬁlm
polymers, it is important to store samples in vacuum and at low (room) temperatures, and to test them as
soon as possible after retrieval. Use of multiple samples, stored and tested over time after retrieval, may
allow back extrapolation to the in-spaoe properties if the degradation proﬁle follows an exponential decay
curve.

Erosion Depth Versus Mass Loss for Erosion Yield Measurement

Measurement of the atomic oxygen erosion yield of thin ﬁlm polymers is complicated by the fact that
cone and valley formation can result in erosion occurring in more than one stacked polymer sheet, as can
be seen in ﬁgure 10 for the MISSE 2 polyetheretherketone (PEEK) sample stack. Figure 11 illustrates
how the valleys between the cones can extend down into a lower sample layer. This situation makes
erosion yield measurement based on proﬁlometry erroneous because the erosion is on two separate layers.

Thus, dehydrated weight loss measurements can easily take this erosion complication into account as
one would weigh the entire stack before and after ﬂight. But, for erosion yield determination based on
mass loss, the density needs to be accurately known. Dehydration of samples is also very important to
avoid weight inaccuracies due to variations in the degree of absorbed water in the samples.

The lesson learned is to use dehydrated weight measurements for erosion yield measurement of
stacked thin ﬁlm polymers to avoid complications due to atomic oxygen texturing of samples.

"14","Polymer Ash Content Effects on Atomic Oxygen Erosion Yield

Most polymers contain some fraction of inorganic material. As atomic oxygen erodes a polymer that
contains inorganic material, the resulting nonvolatile ash begins to accumulate on the eroded surface of
the polymer. For high ﬂuenee missions, such as MISSE 2 PEACE polymers Where the ﬂuence was
8.43><1O21 atoms/em2 (ref. 19), this can cause the atomic oxygen to gradually become somewhat shielded
from reacting With the underlying polymer. As a result, it is believed that the ash content of polymers can
have an inﬂuence on the erosion yield of a polymer. Table 111 lists the erosion yield for a few pairs of
MISSE 2 PEACE polymers that had similar chemical structure. The data (ref. 19) shows that in spite of
the pairs being very similar in chemical structure they had different erosion yields based largely on their
ash content. The ash content was measured by simply exposing and weighing samples of the polymers
(held in small aluminum foil cups) to atomic oxygen in an RF plasma asher until no further polymer
remained.

TABLE III.—COMPARISON OF THE EROSION YIELDS OF TWO PAIRS OF CHEMICALLY SIMILAR
POLYMERS HAVING DIFFERENT ASH CONTENTS

The lesson learned is that ash content in polymers can result in a reduction in erosion yield especially
for high ﬂuenee missions.

Summary

As a result of the data and experiences obtained from numerous space ﬂight experiments and
investigators, several lessons learned stand out as worthy of note for consideration by prudent
investigators designing experiments for space environmental durability of materials. They include:

(1) It is important to verify and Witness that instructions and procedures are properly followed.
Design your experiments to provide useful results even if the mission is factors longer than planned
(hence plan for 3X or greater then the planned mission duration, stack multiple thin ﬁlm samples together,
etc.).

(2) Be careful to avoid self contamination and to be out of the View of sources of silicone to reduce
the possibility that volatile silicone deposits and atomic oxygen do not produce silica deposits that can
affect erosion yields or cause changes in solar absorptanee.

(3) Atomic oxygen does not scatter in a cosine distribution or in a specular direction but instead at
45° from normal for aluminum. This means that one may need to be careful and take into consideration
the geometry of the spacecraft that may lead to scattered atomic oxygen erosion of materials.

(4) Sample holder ehamfers can be a source of ﬂux concentrations Which can cut out the perimeter of
thin samples, and in some cases cause the samples to roll up or potentially be released prior to the full
erosion of the sample.

(5) Mark samples for orientation or photo-doeument them to allow their orientation to be known for
post ﬂight analysis.

(6) To properly evaluate radiation induced tensile property damage in thin ﬁlm polymers, it is
important to store samples in vacuum and at low or room temperatures and then to test them as soon as
possible after retrieval.

13. SUPPLEMENTARY NOTES
14. ABSTRACT
There have been ﬁve Materials International Space Station Experiment (MISSE) passive experiment carriers (PECs) (MISSE 1-5) to date
that have been launched, exposed in space on the exterior of International Space Station (188) and then returned to Earth for analysis. An
additional four MISSE PECs (MISSE 6A, 6B, 7A, and 7B) are in various stages of completion. The PECs are two-sided suitcase to size
sample carriers that are intended to provide information on the effects of the low Earth orbital environment on a Wide variety of materials
and components. As a result of post retrieval analyses of the retrieved MISSE 2 experiments and numerous prior space experiments, there
have been valuable lessons learned and needs identiﬁed that are worthy of being documented so that planning, design, and analysis of future
space environment experiments can beneﬁt from the experience in order to maximize the knowledge gained. Some of the lessons learned
involve the techniques, concepts, and issues associated With measuring atomic oxygen erosion yields. These are presented along With several
issues to be considered When designing experiments, such as the uncertainty in mission duration, scattering and contamination effects on
results, and the accuracy of measuring atomic oxygen erosion.
