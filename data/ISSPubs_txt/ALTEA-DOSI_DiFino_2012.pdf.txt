Abstract. The knowledge of the composition of the radiation environment is an important

information for all the radiation safety issues needed for the planning of future long manned

space missions. The ALTEA detector is on board the International Space Station since J uly 2006

and during this period it has performed a detailed measurement of the radiation environment.

In this paper we present a summary of past measures and results.
1. Introduction
The detailed knowledge of the radiation environment in the International Space Station (188)
is a mandatory step toward a successful radiation risk assessment, needed for the planning of
future long manned space missions. ALTEA (Anomalous Long Term Effects on Astronauts) is a
multidisciplinary program also devoted at monitoring the International Space Station radiation
environment. The ALTEA active particle telescopes feature real time monitoring capability and
nuclear discrimination [1, 2, 3]. The ALTEA—space detector was placed on board the 188 on
J uly 2006 and it has been operative since August 2006 in different conﬁgurations and different
positions and orientations inside the UsLab and the Columbus module of the International Space
Station (188). In this paper we will provide a summary of the results and ﬁndings of these years
of measurements.
2. The ALTEA-space detector
The ALTEA cosmic ray detector is composed by six Silicon Detector Units (SDUs). Each SDU
consists of a particle telescope made of six planes divided in strips to measure energy loss and
direction of detected particles. Each SDU has a geometric factor of 230 cm2 37“. The LET (in sil—
icon) range of the detector goes from a threshold of 2.9i0.2 keV/mm up to about 800 keV/mm,
which corresponds to ions between L73 and F 6 with a small energy windows on Helium and pro—
tons. The modularity 0f ALTEA permits to work with different conﬁgurations. The SDUs were
arranged on a helmet—shaped structure until September 2010. In this conﬁguration the whole de—
tector sports a geometric factor of 1190 cm2 37“. For further details the reader is addressed to [1].

In this conﬁguration ALTEA can operates in two different modes, named Dosimetry (D081)

and Central Nervous System Monitoring (CNSM), which are, respectively, unmanned and
manned operative modes. D081 is a continuous measure, while the CNSM sessions lasts 90
minutes. During DOSI mode ALTEA measures radiation ﬂuxes on board 188. Only Silicon

Detector System (SDS) is switched on and telemetry data, both engineering and scientiﬁc, are
downloaded in real—time. Seven 90 — min CNSM sessions on three different astronaut subjects
were performed between 2006 and 2007. During eaCh session the astronaut signal perceptions of
Light Flashes with a pushbutton while SDS will measure cosmic rays ﬂux, so that it is possible
to study concurrently the passage of cosmic radiation through the brain, the functional status
of the Visual system and the electrophysiological dynamics of the cortical activity.

In September 2010 ALTEA SDUs were rearranged in a different conﬁguration 011 a different
support structure for Survey, the ﬁrst part Of the ESA experiment ALTEA—Shield. Each SDU
couple forms a silicon telescope of twelve planes, and eaCh telescope aims at a different direction
in space. In this conﬁguration ALTEA measured the cosmic ray particle ﬂux until J une 8, 2012,
when ALTEA was moved to the Columbus module of the 188 to start the second part Of the
ALTEA—Shield experiment, named Shield.

3. Measurements
The typical particle rate measured by the ALTEA SDS shows the typical periodic modulations
due to the passage between high and low latitude regions (see Fig.1)[2].
The highest peaks correspond to passes through the South Atlantic Anomaly (SAA), where
there is a large increase of the particle ﬂux due to the contribution of the protons trapped in
the inner radiation belt. The lower curve shows the particle count rate of the Z > 5 component
which, excluding protons, does not show SAA increase. There is another Visible modulation

Correlating ALTEA data with 188 orbital information, we grouped these events with respect
to the value of their geomagnetic coordinates [3], B and L, B being the magnetic ﬁeld value

ﬂux measured by the GOES—ll satellite shows the correlation of the events recorded with the
two instruments. The SPE effects can ﬁnally be identiﬁed in the unusually high rate peaks of
Fig. 4. A study on ion abundances was performed using a novel algorithm that permits to esti—
mate nuclear composition even from spectrum that lacks enough statistics to apply the standard
ﬁtting method [5]. Comparing these measurements with analogous measurements during quiet
Sun conditions we Observed an increase of the light ion (Z < 5) rate with respect to the values
recorded during the quiescent times. In our limited acceptance window for proton the mean
measured rate over the whole SPE week is 1.5 times greater than the rate during the quiescent
condition, but the ratio rises to about 10 (lower limit) when averaged over the solar most aC—
tive period (three 188 orbits). By contrast, the abundance of heavier nuclei results unchanged
within the errors with respect to quiet Sun conditions. Measurements carried on during 2009

show that the radiation ﬂuenees in the USLab—ISS feature quite different constituents along
the three axes: the radiation coming from different directions has signiﬁcantly different quality.
This anisotropy for high—LET particles (LET > 50 keV/mm) is a factor of 3 in LET and con—
sequently in dose and is minimum along the USLab longitudinal axis and maximum normal to it.
To analyze ﬂux anisotropies, we calculated the LET spectra in three orthogonal directions
corresponding to the main axis of 188, where the Y and Z directions correspond to the transverse
sections of the USLab while X is along the ISS longitudinal axis. All the spectra are then
normalized with the proper geometric factor. We notice that high—LET particle ﬂux is very
attenuated along the X direction (Fig. 5), while at low LET (< 13 keV/mm) the X spectrum is
the highest (Fig. 5, inset). Integrating these LET spectra for all particles (LET > 3 keV/mm)

and for high—LET particles, deﬁned here as those with energy release more than 50 keV/mm in
Silicon (corresponding to ions that deposit more energy than a M 9 ion at 2 GeV/nucleon), we
can compare the particle ﬂuxes and total LET rates in the three directions deﬁned above and
in the different geomagnetic regions (see Fig. 6). High—LET particles in the X direction are a
factor between 1.6 and 2.3 lower than in the Y and Z directions in all regions. This anisotropy
for high—LET particles becomes a factor between 2.3 and 3.2 in terms of LET rates.

in the Columbus module.

In this period ALTEA, exploiting its large energy Window acceptance, performed a detailed

measurement of the radiation environment on board a space vessel, studying for example the

different components of the cosmic rays depending on the measurement position and on the

incidence direction, and it was capable to evaluate the enhancement of the ﬂux during the

SPES.

ALTEA is now Operative in the Columbus module, Where it Will evaluate the effects of different

shielding materials on the incidence particle ﬂux.

All the ALTEA measures will provide a hint to assess the radiation risks for the human

permanence in the space.
