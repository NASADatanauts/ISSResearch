Abstract
As the duration of spaceﬂight increases, the impact of habitability on mission success becomes significant. Habitability is
based on the qualities and capabilities of an environment that enable people to work and live. Poor habitability can impact
productivity, safety. well-being, and performance. The International Space Station (ISS) Operational Habitability Project
has been established to address the increased role of habitability for ISS. The primary objective of the project is to
establish a pool of data from which opinions and decisions forjudging and improving habitability on ISS will be generated. .
The main activities of the project are to: 1) collect and interpret data related to habitability on ISS; 2) identify Operational
Habitability Lessons Learned; and 3) provide data summaries. judgments, and recommendations for the improvement of
habitability. As an example, the ISS Operational Habitability Project has provided significant inputs to a current ISS issue
regarding stowage. In this situation, a lack of prioritization on habitability resulted in a less than ideal situation. Operational
Habitability data from previous missions was identiﬁed and summarized to provide inputs to assist in working the issues
toward a resolution that supports habitability on iSS.
