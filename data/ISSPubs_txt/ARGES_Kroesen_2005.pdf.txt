guished. The line integrated measurements of the spectrometer

represent lateral proﬁles. They have to be converted to radial

proﬁles by Abel inversion. This has been done for a number of

experiment conditions. An extreme example of the differences

to be observed for 0g and 2g can be found in ﬁgure 7. Under 2

g conditions, it is obvious that the radial de-rnixing, Which is

strongly occuring (see the 0g measurement), is almost totally

suppressed by convective mixing 0r “stirring”.

The experiments in the 188 were a 100 % success. A11 fore-
seen measurements have been taken and all data was transport-
ed back to the experimenters. Already during the experiment
operations, the results proved to be very surprising. Whereas the
instabilities in the lamp were expected to be shaped as a rotat-
ing helix, they appeared to be a singly bent curve Which is not
rotating. Analysis afterwards has indicated that the rotation is
caused by convection solely and that the curving is caused by
self—generated magnetic ﬁelds. For one condition, residual grav-
ity caused a very slow rotation. As expected, the aXial de-rniX-
ing did not occur during the Delta mission experiments, so the
radial derniXing can indeed be studied udisturbed. The analysis
of the spectra is well underway.
