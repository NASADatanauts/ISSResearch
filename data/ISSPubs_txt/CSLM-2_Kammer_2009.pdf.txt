In any two-phase mixture that contains particles of different sizes, the large particles
tend to grow while the small particles shrink in a process called coarsening. Coarsening
occurs on Earth during the processing of any metal alloy and thus the coarsening process
affects products from dental ﬁllings t0 turbine blades. Solid-liquid mixtures are ideal sys-
tems to study this coarsening process. However, gravity can induce particle sedimentation
and thus hamper the studies of coarsening in these mixtures on Earth. Using the micro-
gravity environment of the Space Station it is possible to study the coarsening process
in solid-liquid mixtures with reduced interference from the sedimentation that occurs on
Earth. Speciﬁcally we have studied the coarsening process in systems consisting of par-
ticles of tin suspended in a liquid tin-lead alloy. A series of experiments were performed
in the Microgravity Glove Box on the International Space Station in November and De-
cember 2007, with sample return in February 2008. The microstructures show that the
experiments were successful. We have begun to collect data from the samples.

decrease the total interfacial area per volume, small particles disappear and large particles grow. This process
is driven by the dependence of the interfacial concentration on the mean curvature, H , of the interface. The
equilibrium concentration at the interface in the matrix of a small particle with large H is higher than that
of a large particle with low H , and thus rnass ﬂows from the small particle to the large particle and the
small particle disappears. As a result the average particle size increases with time while the number density
of particles decreases, and the total volume fraction of particles remains constant. A particularly important
aspect of the coarsening process of a system of spherical particles is that the mean curvature of a particle
is given by H = l/R, meaning that the concentration along the interface of a spherical particle is constant.
Therefore only the particle radius is needed to deﬁne the interfacial boundaries and to specify the interfacial
concentration and curvatures. There is thus a direct link between the curvature of a particle and its volume.

The coarsening of a two—phase system with spherical particles has received extensive study, both theo—
reticallyli8 and experirnentally.9*11 The kinetics of Ostwalol ripening were studied theoretically by Lifshitz
and Slyozov1 and by Wagner2 and it was shown that the microstructure and speciﬁcally R will evolve with
time as follows:

R302) — 153(0) : KLSWt (1)
where R(t) is the average particle radius (which serves as a measure of the system’s length scale) at a time
t, R(O) is the average particle radius in the beginning of coarsening and K LSW is the LSW coarsening rate
constant. For an isothermal solid—liquiol system K LSW is given by:

STOFD

KLSW 9ML(CS _ CL) (2)
T 0 is the coarsening temperature, F is the capillary length of the matrix or liquid phase, D is the diffusion
coefﬁcient of the solute in the matrix, M L is the slope of the liquidus curve at T 0, and CS and CL are
the equilibrium concentrations of the solute at a planar interface in the solid and liquid, respectively. The
coarsening rate constant, K , is a function of volume fraction, Q5, such that:

KW) = KLSWf<¢> (3)
where f (Q5) is a system independent function, such that K : K LSW when Q5 2 0.

Another important Characteristic of the coarsening process for a system of spherical particles is self—
similarity, which is well established, both experimentally and theoretically. Self—similarity describes the fact
that the size distributions of spherical particles for different coarsening times become almost identical when
scaled or renormalizeol by a time dependent length scale, in this case the average radius R. The LSW theory
examines the coarsening of inﬁnitely separated, spherical particles, that is it assumes zero volume fraction.
In the limit where t —> 00, it was found that the microstructure should become self—similar when scaled by
the average particle size. This is also termed the steady—state coarsening,

II. Experimental Procedure

The solid—liquiol system that was Chosen for this work is a mixture of Sn particles in a Pb—Sn eutectic
matrix. The lead—tin system offers many beneﬁts from an experimental point of View because of its low
eutectic temperature (18300), a Virtually isotropic interfacial energy and its documented availability of
physical and thermodynamic olata.9 It is also convenient because of the spherical particles formed and its
rapid coarsening rate (a large Change in particle radius occurs over a relatively short time). Solid—liquiol
systems have the disadvantage that the density difference between the solid and the liquid phase leads to
sedimentation of the particles during coarsening. In our case, to avoid the sedimentation of Sn particles,
as well as limit the amount of convection in the liquid, the experiments were performed in microgravity. A
series of experiments were performed in the Microgravity Glove Box on the International Space Station in
November and December 2007, with sample return in February 2008.

The samples were cast and cold worked following the method used by Hardy and Voorhees.9 In micro—
gravity, the samples are ﬁrst heated to the solid—liquiol regime, held isotherrnally at 1850C (200 above the
eutectic temperature for the Pb—Sn system) for the coarsening time Chosen and then quenched quickly. Once
all the experiments are complete the samples were returned to Earth and analyzed in our laboratory.

A11 twenty—four successful samples (81X coarsening times X four volume fractions) have been examined in
our lab, see Table 1. Figure 1 Shows cross sections of two samples, etched such that the solid Sn—partieles
are White and the region that was liquid at the processing temperature is black, With Figure 1a for a sample
With a 30% volume fraction of solid and Figure 1b for a sample With a 50% volume fraction of solid. We can
make some key observations that ensured the experiments success,,:

0 There were no elongated grains observed in the microstructures.

0 There was no sedimentation observed. The particles are distributed throughout the samples surface,

an important success criterion for the experiments,

0 The samples appear to have undergone a nice, rapid quench, leading to a ﬁne eutectic structure.

Sn—particles are white and the formerly liquid phase is black.

We ﬁnd that in all cases the average particle radius increases With coarsening time, proof that the
microstructures coarsened. The mierostructures Show solid particles that are nearly perfect Spheres for the
lower volume fractions and spheroidal for the higher volume fractions. In the In the 30% volume fraction
samples there is some solidiﬁcation Shrinkage. The solidiﬁcation shrinkage Virtually disappears for the 50%
volume fraction samples and has completely disappeared for the 70% and 80%.

sured on a cross—section, we have determined the kinetics of the coarsening process. The linear dependence
of the average particle radius as a function of 751/3 can be seen in Figure 2. This includes data from both
CSLM—l, taken on the shuttle, and data from CSLM—2, taken on the International Space Station. Both
sets of data lie on the same line, indicating that the initial condition of each sample and the experimental
conditions were the same. Using this data we ﬁnd that the slope of the line is approximately a factor of two
larger than predicted by theory. We are currently examining why this may be the case.

IV. Summary

The International Space Station can be used to perform successful coarsening experiments using solid
particles embedded in a liquid. We received 24 successfully coarsening samples and we are in the process
of analyzing these samples. Preliminary results show that the mixtures at 30% volume fraction of solid are
coarsening a factor of 2 faster than theory predicts.
