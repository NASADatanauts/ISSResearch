Abstract. Boiling is one of the efﬁcient modes of heat transfer due to phase change, and is
regarded as promising means to be applied for the thermal management systems handling a
large amount of waste heat under high heat ﬂux. However, gravity effects on the two-phase
ﬂow phenomena and corresponding heat transfer characteristics have not been clariﬁed in
detail. The experiments onboard J apanese Experiment Module “KIBO” in International Space
Station on boiling two-phase ﬂow under microgravity conditions are proposed to clarify both
of heat transfer and ﬂow characteristics under microgravity conditions. To verify the feasibility
of ISS experiments on boiling two—phase ﬂow, the Bread Board Model is assembled and its
performance and the function of components installed in a test 100p are examined.
1. Introduction
Recent increase in the size of space platforms requires the management of larger amount of waste heat
under high heat ﬂux conditions and the transportation of it along a long distance to the radiator. F low
boiling applied to the thermal management system in space attracts much attention as promising
means to realize high-performance heat transfer and transport. In microgravity two-phase ﬂow
phenomena are quite different from those under normal gravity conditions because buoyancy effects
are signiﬁcantly reduced and surface tension becomes dominant.

Although a number of experiments on boiling heat transfer in microgravity were conducted
worldwide from the 1970s to the present, and reviewed by Di Marco [1], Kim [2] and Ohta [3]. Ohta
[4] investigated for ﬂow boiling in a transparent heated tube coated With gold thin ﬁlm for different
gravity levels along the parabolic trajectory of an aircraft. In the annular ﬂow regime, at heat ﬂux not
high enough to initiate the nucleate boiling, the heat transfer coefﬁcient in microgravity deteriorates

due to the increase in the thickness of annular liquid ﬁlm and the reduction of turbulence in it. No
marked gravity effect on the heat transfer is observed when the heat transfer is dominated by nucleate
boiling.

On the other hand, the effects of direction of gravity vector on ﬂow boiling were conducted by the
researchers. Zhang et al. [5] changed orientation of narrow channel and examined the inﬂuence on the
critical heat ﬂux. F low boiling experiments were conducted by using the rectangular narrow channel
with heating surfaces of lengths 101.6mm, width 30mm and gap size 2.5mm. At low velocity
experiments, especially for saturated conditions, critical heat ﬂux for downward ﬂow was much
smaller than for upward ﬂow. Kandlikar and Balasubramanian [6] conducted effects of channel
orientation on ﬂow boiling heat transfer by using the rectangular narrow channels with 1.054mm
width, 0.197mm depth and a hydraulic diameter of 0.333 mm. They also observed heat transfer
coefﬁcients in the vertical downward ﬂow are higher than those in vertical upward ﬂow and horizontal
ﬂow. Bower and Klausner [7] proposed the gravity dependent/independent regime map on subcooled
ﬂow boiling heat transfer by changing orientations of in rectangular narrow channel. They employed
Jakob number Ja and dimensionless ﬂow rate parameter y/ as important parameters for deﬁning the
gravity dominant regime.

However, gravity effects on the two-phase ﬂow phenomena and corresponding heat transfer
characteristics have not been clariﬁed in detail. The experiments onboard the International Space
Station (188) is proposed to clarify systematically the data and corresponding mechanisms for both of
heat transfer and of ﬂow characteristics under microgravity conditions. The establishment of
dominated force regime maps by the introduction of appropriate dimensionless groups is also an
important objective, because the design of space thermal devices under the conditions of no gravity
effect becomes more reliable based mainly on the ground test. In F igure 1, red lines in the ﬁgure are
the proposed boundaries based on the recent data for ﬂow boiling in Inini-ehannels [8]. Bond number

Where, di: tube inner diameter, G: mass velocity, um: mean velocity, pm = 1/[x/pv+(1-x)/pg]: mean
density of liquid and vapor, x: vapor quality. Therefore, Bo, We and F r represent ratios of buoyancy to
surface tension, inertia to surface tension and inertia t0 buoyancy, respectively. In the body force
dominated region, effects of gravity level and ﬂow direction become signiﬁcant. In the Inertia
dominated region, effects of mass velocity and vapor quality are observed, and in the surface tension
dominated region, effects of gravity, mass velocity and vapor quality become small. There are four
points to be clariﬁed concerning the present regime map.
1. Boundaries of regimes are doubtful.
2. Deﬁnitions of parameters should be revised.
3. Parameters and boundaries should be changed by different targets such as heat transfer
coefﬁcient, ﬂow patterns, pressure drop and critical heat ﬂux.
4. Inﬂuence of vapor quality is unknown. Increase in vapor quality increases inertia force due to
the increase in 1iquid-vap0r mixture velocity despite of decrease in mixture density.
It is doubtful that the effect of gravity level is equivalent to the effect of the gravity direction on
deﬁnition of regime boundary between the body force dominated and the surface tension dominated
through Bond number. The microgravity experiments are useful for the veriﬁcation of the effect of
gravity level on these regimes. Figure 2 shows points of experimental conditions for the ISS and
ground experiments on the dominated force regime map. In further studies, the results obtained under
microgravity conditions are to be reﬂected to conﬁrm the effect of gravity level on the boundaries at
very low Bond numbers.
In the present paper, a test loop is proposed for 188 experiments under the limited resources of
volume size and power supply, and preliminary experiments on ﬂow boiling are performed on ground.

heat transfer coefﬁcient along the heated section is calculated as discrete values at each location of 10
thermocouples based on the measured outer wall temperatures, ﬂow rate, inlet liquid temperature, and
inlet/outlet pressure. The heat loss from the outer tube wall to the ambient is evaluated by the
difference between the outer wall temperature and ambient temperature, Which is calibrated in advance.
By the introduction of insulation and thin thermocouples, the heat loss is minimized to 45% even at
the lowest heat ﬂuX tested. The inner wall temperature and the inner wall heat ﬂuX at each
thermocouple location are evaluated by the radial heat conduction from the measured outer wall
temperature and the local heat generation rate, taking into account the heat loss.

The inlet liquid temperature is measured by a K-type sheathed thermocouple inserted. The local
heat transfer coefﬁcient 0c at the location of each thermocouple is deﬁned by

Where, q: inner wall heat ﬂux to ﬂuid, T W: inner wall temperature, 7}: mean ﬂuid temperature. 7} is
evaluated from the heat balance equation. The saturation temperature Tm is used as 7} in the vapor
quality region x > 0.

A value of two-phase pressure drop in the vapor quality region is obtained by subtracting the value
in the unheated section and the subcooled region from the pressure drop across the entire test section.
The single-phase pressure drop is evaluated in the subcooled region, ignoring the possibility of partial
boiling. In the vapor quality region, linear pressure drop is assumed using the pressures at the end of
the subcooled region and at the outlet of the test section. Distribution of saturation temperature in the
vapor quality region is obtained by the pressure distribution. All of the instruments used are carefully
calibrated. The uncertainty in temperature measurement is i 0.15 K, pressure measurement i 0.5%,
and ﬂow rate setting i 0.25%. The accuracy of heat transfer coefﬁcients is evaluated to be i 6.4%.
2.2.2. T ransparent heated tube. Transparent heated tubes, Which enable the heating, the observation
through the glass tube and the measurement of inner wall temperature simultaneously, are introduced
to clarify the mechanisms of heat transfer by the relationship between liquid-vapor interfacial
behaviors and heat transfer characteristics. The tube is made of pyreX glass, and it has an ID of 4 mm
and a wall thickness of 1 mm. The heated length of the tube is approximately 50 mm, and its inner
wall is uniformly coated With a transparent gold ﬁlm With a thickness of the order of 10 nm. Both ends
of the tube are coated With a thick layer of silver ﬁlm for use as electrodes and are in contact With a
brass ﬂange, as shown in F igure 6. The thin gold ﬁlm for heating is operated as a resistance
thermometer for the temperature measurement. As only the averaged heat transfer characteristics
along the heated length can be obtained because of its structure, the test section is assembled by three
segments in series, i.e., total heated length is 150 mm. At each segment of transparent heated tube, the
measurement of the heat transfer coefﬁcient and the observation of liquid-vapor interfacial behaviors
by CCD camera are performed. F igure 7 shows an example of images of liquid-vapor behaviors in
horizontal ﬂow for different ﬂow patterns recorded by CCD camera through the glass tube wall.

2.2.3. Unheated test section of acrylic tube. The unheated sections enable to observe detailed liquid-
Vapor interfacial structures, especially of void fraction and the distribution, and behaviors of annular
liquid ﬁlm, additionally to the measurement of pressure drop. The tube is made of polymethyl
methacrylate, and the tube length between installed pressure taps is 80 mm.

3.]. Heat transfer coeﬁcient at metal heated tube
F igure 8 shows the relation between the heat transfer coefﬁcient and vapor quality at G = 100 kg/m2s
for different values of inlet condition in horizontal ﬂow. Almost no effect of inlet liquid subcooling
and inlet vapor quality is observed, and the heat transfer coefﬁcient does not depend on the heating
history in the upstream by the use of the metal heated tube installed in the test 100p for the ground test.
F igure 9 shows the relation between the heat transfer coefﬁcient and vapor quality for subcooling
of inlet liquid ATSMW = 10 K at the test section inlet under all mass velocity conditions in horizontal
ﬂow and vertical upward ﬂow. In the range from low to moderate vapor quality at G = 40—3 00 kg/m2s
and in low vapor quality x < 0.2 at G = 500 kg/mzs, heat transfer coefﬁcients is almost independent of
mass velocity and vapor quality for both tube orientations. On the other hand, under the moderate
vapor quality region, the trends of transition from the nucleate boiling region to two-phase forced
convection region Where the heat transfer coefﬁcient increases With vapor quality are not clearly
observed. This is explained as follows. Under low heat ﬂux conditions, the length of heated tube is too
short to realize the moderate or high vapor quality even at the outlet of the tube. On the other hand,
under high heat ﬂux conditions, nucleate boiling is dominant even in annular ﬂow regime at moderate
and high vapor qualities. It is needed to perform experiments in high vapor quality under lower heat
ﬂux conditions by adjusting inlet vapor quality in further studies. In addition, under the highest heat
ﬂux condition for G = 40—3 00 kg/mzs, the deterioration of heat transfer due to dryout is observed. The
trend in the nucleate boiling region is conﬁrmed by the existing researches, for example, for F reons by
using the tubes With 1.10—4.26 mm inner diameter [10—12]. The relationship between the heat transfer
coefficients and heat flux in the nucleate boiling region is shown in Figure 10 for both tube
orientations. For the nucleate boiling, the relation of heat transfer coefﬁcient a and heat ﬂux q

Incidentally, at G = 500 kg/m2s, the tWO-phase forced convection region and the dryout region is not
observed because no test are conducted under higher heat ﬂux conditions because of the restriction of
the limited power supply 400W from the candidate facility in MSPR.

Figure 11 shows images of ﬂow pattern transition recorded by a CCD camera at vertical upward ﬂow,
G = 120 kg/m2s for an example. Four principal ﬂow patterns, i.e., slug ﬂow, churn ﬂow, semi-annular
ﬂow and annular ﬂow, were observed. Figure 12 shows ﬂow patterns at vertical upward ﬂow in
present study and existing ﬂow pattern map proposed by Barnea et a1. [13]. Superﬁcial liquid velocity

4. Conclusions

In order to verify the feasibility of the experiments on boiling and two-phase ﬂow onboard 188, a test

loop similar to the ﬂight model was developed and preliminary ground experiments on ﬂow boiling

were performed.

1. The operation and performance of all components installed in the test loop was conﬁrmed.

2. The tendency of heat transfer coefﬁcient obtained from the metal heated tube and images of ﬂow
patterns were checked in detail and they coincide with those of existing researches despite of the
restrictions in the length of test sections. Then, the ﬂight model with similar speciﬁcations will
produce the reliable reference data for the normal gravity condition if it is operated on ground
before the experiment onboard ISS.
