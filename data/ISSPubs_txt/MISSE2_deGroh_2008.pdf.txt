Abstract: Forty—one different polymer samples, collectively called the Polymer Erosion and Contami—
nation Experiment (PEACE) Polymers, were exposed to the low Earth orbit (LEO) environment on the
exterior of the International Space Station (188) for nearly 4 years as part of Materials International Space
Station Experiment 2 (MISSE 2). The obj ective of the PEACE Polymers experiment was to determine the
atomic oxygen erosion yield of a wide variety of polymeric materials after long—term exposure to the space
environment. The polymers range from those commonly used for spacecraft applications, such as Teﬂon®
FEP, to more recently developed polymers, such as high temperature polyimide PMR (polymerization of
monomer reactants). Additional polymers were included to explore erosion yield dependence upon Chem—
ical composition. The MISSE PEACE Polymers experiment was ﬂown in MISSE Passive Experiment
Carrier 2 (PEC 2), tray 1, attached to the exterior of the ISS Quest Airlock. It was exposed to atomic oxy—
gen along with solar and Charged particle radiation. MISSE 2 was successfully retrieved during a space
walk on J uly 30, 2005 during Discovery’s STS—l 14 Return to Flight mission. Details on the specific poly—
mers ﬂown, ﬂight sample fabrication, pre—ﬂight and post—ﬂight Characterization techniques, and atomic
oxygen ﬂuence calculations are discussed along with a summary of the atomic oxygen erosion yield re—
sults. The MISSE 2 PEACE Polymers experiment is unique because it has the widest variety of polymers
ﬂown in LEO for a long duration and was exposed to an unusually Clean LEO spacecraft environment.
This experiment provides extremely valuable erosion yield data for spacecraft design purposes.

1. INTRODUCTION
Polymers such as polyimide Kapton® and Teﬂon® FEP (ﬂuorinated ethylene propylene)
are commonly used spacecraft materials because of their desirable properties such as
ﬂexibility, low density, and electrical, thermal and optical properties. Materials on the
exterior of spacecraft in the low Earth orbit (LEO) environment are exposed to atomic
oxygen (A0). Atomic oxygen is formed when short wavelength ultraviolet radiation from
the Sun photodissociates molecular oxygen in the upper atmosphere. Although A0 is the
predominant species in LEO (below m 650 km), these neutral oxygen atoms have mean
free paths on the order of 104 m at 400 km, resulting in extremely low probabilities of
re-association. As a spacecraft orbits the Earth it travels with a velocity of approximately
7.7 km s‘1 and rams into the oxygen atoms. The ﬂux of A0 at the International Space
Station (188) altitudes is approximately 5.23 x 1013 atoms cm‘2 s‘1 for normal incident
ram surfaces (at 400 km altitude averaged over the 11 year solar cycle), and the average
energy of an oxygen atom impacting spacecraft at ram velocities is 4.5 eV [1].

A number of processes can take place when an oxygen atom strikes a spacecraft sur-
face at orbital velocities. These include Chemical reaction with surface molecules, elastic
scattering, scattering with partial or full thermal accommodation, recombination, 0r eXCi-
tation of ram species [2]. The final oxidation product for most polymers is a gas, therefore
AO erosion results. Materials with volatile oxidation products develop cone-like mor-
phologies under directed AO attack. Atomic oxygen erosion of polymeric components,
such as thermal control films and solar array blankets, can be a serious threat to spacecraft
performance and durability. It is therefore essential to understand the AO erosion yield,
Ey, the volume loss per incident oxygen atom (cm3 atom‘l) of polymers for spacecraft
applications.

Forty-one different polymer samples, collectively called the Polymer Erosion and
Contamination Experiment (PEACE) Polymers, were exposed to the LEO space enVi-
ronment 0n the exterior of the 18$ for nearly 4 years as part of Materials International
Space Station Experiment 2 (MISSE 2). The purpose of the MISSE 2 PEACE Polymers
experiment was to accurately determine the AO erosion yield of a wide variety of poly-
meric materials exposed for an extended period of time to the LEO space environment
[3]. The polymers range from those commonly used for spacecraft applications, such as
Teﬂ0n® FEP, to more recently developed polymers, such as high temperature polyimide
PMR (polymerization of monomer reactants). Additional polymers were included to eX-
plore erosion yield dependence upon Chemical composition to enable the development of
an erosion yield predictive model. Details on the specific polymers ﬂown, ﬂight sam-
ple fabrication, pre-ﬂight and post-ﬂight Characterization techniques, and atomic oxygen
ﬂuence determination are discussed along with a summary of the atomic oxygen erosion
yield results.

2. EROSION YIELD MEASUREMENTS
2.1. Erosion yield determination
A common technique for determining the erosion yield (Ey) of ﬂight samples is based on
mass loss and is calculated using dehydrated mass measurements before and after ﬂight.
The erosion yield of the sample is determined through the following equation:

E _ AMS (1)

y (AsPsF>

where Ey is the erosion yield of ﬂight sample (cm3 atom‘l); MS is the mass loss of the
ﬂight sample (g); AS is the surface area of the ﬂight sample exposed to atomic oxygen
(cmz); p5 is the density of ﬂight sample (g cm‘3); and F is the ﬂuence of atomic oxygen
(atoms cm‘z).

The A0 ﬂuence (F ) can be determined through the mass loss of a Kapton H witness
sample because Kapton H has a well Characterized erosion yield, EK, (3.0 x 10‘24 cm3
atom‘l) in the LEO environment [4]. Therefore, the AO ﬂuence can be calculated using
the following equation:

AMK
F = — (2)
(AKPKEK)
where F is the LEO AO ﬂuence (atoms cm‘z); AMK is the mass loss of Kapton H witness
sample (g); AK is the surface area of Kapton H witness sample exposed to atomic oxygen
(cmz); pK is the density of Kapton H witness sample (1.4273 g cm‘3); and EK is the
erosion yield of Kapton H witness sample (3.0 x 10‘24 cm3 atom‘l).

Thus

AM A

Ey = EKS—K'DK (3)

AMKASIDS
Another technique for determining erosion yield is based on recession depth measure-
ments. As many of the PEACE Polymers are composed of multiple thin film layers (see
Section 4.1) and erosion can occur in multiple layers at one time, as shown in the UpileX-S
and Kapton H samples in Section 8, it was decided that mass loss was the best technique
for this ﬂight experiment. In addition, individual layers can be so fragile after erosion that
measurements of recession depth would be impossible to obtain. With mass loss mea-
surements, an average mass of the fragile pieces and layers and underlying non-eroded
supportive layers can be obtained.

2.2. Rehydration/dehydration issues
One of the critical issues with using mass loss for obtaining accurate erosion yield data is
that dehydrated mass measurements are needed. Many polymer materials, such as Kapton,
are very hygroscopic (absorbing up to 2% of their weight in moisture) and can ﬂuctuate
in mass with humidity and temperature. Therefore, for accurate mass loss measurements
to be obtained, it is necessary that the samples be fully dehydrated (i.e. in a vacuum
desiccator) immediately prior to measuring the mass both pre-ﬂight and post-ﬂight.
3. PEACE POLYMERIC MATERIALS
The specific polymers Chosen for the MISSE PEACE Polymers experiment represent a
wide range of polymeric materials and bonding types. Included are those commonly used
for spacecraft applications, such as Teﬂon FEP, to more recently developed polymers,
such as high temperature polyimide PMR (polymerization of monomer reactants). Poly-
mers such as polyethylene oxide and cellulose acetate are also included based solely on
their Chemical composition to provide LEO erosion yield data for modeling purposes.
Two polyimide Kapton H samples were included to serve as ﬂuence calibration witness
samples. The 41 polymers, their associated polymer abbreviations and the MISSE serial
numbers are listed in table 1.

4. SAMPLE FABRICATION AND PRE-FLIGHT

CHARACTERIZATION
4.1. F light sample dimensions and fabrication
The MISSE PEACE Polymers samples were approximately 2.54 cm diameter disks. The
polymers were most often obtained in thin film form, typically ranging from 0.0025 to
0.051 cm thick, and were punched into the Circular disks using a double bow punch cutter
and an Arbor press.

Several samples did not come in film form. Allyl diglycol carbonate (ADC, 2-E5- 14),
typically used as lens material, was ordered from a manufacturer in 2.54 cm diameter,
0.079 cm thick samples. Pyrolytic graphite (PG, 2-E5-25) was also ordered in 2.54 cm
diameter pieces, 0.203 cm thick. Hysol EA956 epoxy (EP, 2-E5-l9) was purchased as a
two-part kit. Flight samples were fabricated by mixing and curing the epoxy, and then
carefully sawing out 2.54 cm diameter samples from brittle sheets of cured epoxy. The
thickness of the ﬂight sample was approximately 0.231 cm thick. Polyethylene oxide
(PEO, 2-E5- 17) was purchased as a powder and fabricated into sheet material by pressing
the powder with heated plates using a Carver Laboratory Press. To keep the PEO from
sticking to the plates, two sheets of Kapton were placed between the press plates and the
PEO powder. The PEO was pressed at 23 000 lbs (10.5 metric tons) for 5—10 s while
simultaneously applying heat. The exact temperature of heating is not known, but the
press heats to 260 CC (500 CF) and approximately 40% of the power was used. After
pressing, when completely cooled, the Kapton sheets were carefully separated from the
PEO. This resulted in a sheet of PEO between 0.074 and 0.094 cm thick, from which
2.54 cm diameter samples were punched out. High temperature polyimide resin, PMR-
15 (PI, 2-E5-34), was fabricated by the Polymers Branch at Glenn Research Center in
2.54 cm diameter, 0.030 cm thick pieces. Poly-(p-phenylene terephthalamide), also known
as Kevlar 29 (PPD-T, 2-E5-8), was obtained in fabric form. Flight samples were cut
out and the fabric samples were carefully wrapped in Al disks to protect the edges from
fraying or losing small filaments. The extreme edge on the exposed side was covered with
Al in such a way that only the Kevlar would be exposed to A0 in the ﬂight hardware.
Polyphenylene isophtalate (PPPA), also known as NomeX®, was supplied as 0.005 cm
thick sheets of paper, from which ﬂight samples were easily punched out.

4.2. Sample stacking

MISSE l and 2 were originally planned for a l-year mission. The expected AO ﬂuence for
a l-year exposure on 188 was 3.28 x 1021 atoms crn‘2 for directed AO exposed surfaces,
based on a mission launch date of June 2001, a 400 km Circular orbit and a 51.60 incli-
nation. For many of the thin film polymers, a single layer would be completely eroded
away after a l-year mission. In addition, ﬂight experiments are not always retrieved on
the original planned date, but can be left in space much longer. Depending on the polymer

thickness and estimated erosion yield, stacking of several sample layers was necessary.
The total number of layers to be stacked for ﬂight was Chosen based on surViVing a 3-year
mission (three times the duration of the original planned mission).

Stacking of the sample layers is complicated by the fact that increasing the mass
of the sample causes a decrease in the sensitivity of the mass Change. Therefore, one
would ideally want to measure the lightest sample possible before and after ﬂight so the
mass loss is a significant percentage of the total mass of the sample. Keeping this in
mind, two different sets of samples were stacked together for ﬂight. The first set, called
Part A, included the number of sample layers needed to be stacked together and weighed
to survive an A0 exposure period of 1.5 years (Chosen to be 0.5 years longer than the
mission). The second set, called Part B, was the number of additional sample layers that
were added behind the weighed set to ensure survival of a 3-year mission.

Based on the expected AO ﬂuence for a 1.5 year mission (computed as 4.55 x 1021
atoms cm‘z), and an estimated erosion yield of each polymer, the number of layers for
each sample needed in order to survive 1.5 years of exposure (Part A) was determined.
The A0 ﬂuence for a 3-year mission was computed to be 9.1 x 1021 atoms cm‘2 (twice
the 1.5-year ﬂuence); therefore the total number of samples to be stacked together as
one “ﬂight sample” was calculated based on surViVing the 3-year ﬂuence. The additional
unweighed set (Part B) was placed behind the weighed set in the ﬂight hardware. For
example, the estimated erosion yield for cellulose acetate (CA) is 6.8 x 10‘24 cm3 atom—1
[5]. Based on this erosion yield, the estimated thickness loss for 1.5 years in LEO is
0.031 cm. The sample thickness is only 0.005 cm, therefore seven sample layers were
stacked for mass measurements. A total of 0.062 cm was expected to be eroded away
after 3 years, so 13 total layers were stacked for ﬂight (the seven weighed Part A samples
plus siX additional unweighed Part B samples). In all, a total of 205 individual sample
layers were ﬂown.

For each complete ﬂight sample, an identical baCk-up sample was prepared and Char-
acterized. A11 individual sample layers were carefully scribe marked at the edges indi-
cating sample ID, orientation (front), ﬂight or baCk-up, and whether the sample had been
vacuum heat treated.

4.3. Outgassing and vacuum heat treatment

Samples to be ﬂown in the space environment need to meet outgas requirements as out-
lined in ASTM E 595, the Standard Test Method for Total Mass Loss and Collected
Volatile Condensable Materials from Outgassing in a Vacuum Environment [6]. This
test method evaluates, under carefully controlled conditions, the Changes in the mass of
a test specimen on exposure under vacuum to a temperature of 125 CC [total mass loss
(TML)], and the mass of those products that leave the specimen and condense on a collec-
tor plate at a temperature of 25 CC [collected volatile condensable materials (CVCM)] [6].
MISSE management decided that material being ﬂown as part of MISSE should meet the
historical screening levels of < 1.00% TML and < 0.10% CVCM. Ten of the 41 PEACE

polymers did not meet the outgas requirements either based on previous testing or because
they had not been tested, and it was decided that these polymers could be ﬂown if they
were vacuum heat treated prior to ﬂight to remove volatile products. Vacuum heat treat-
ment was conducted at the NASA Marshall Space Flight Center (MSFC) at a pressure of
6.7 x 10‘5 Pa (5 x 10‘7 torr). Ideally, samples were to be vacuum baked for 24 h at
125 CC (similar to ASTM E 595), but some polymers were heated at lower temperatures
due to low maximum operating temperatures. Table 2 lists the vacuum-heat-treated sam-
ples, their maximum operating temperatures and the vacuum heat treatment temperature
and time.
The polymer PBI (2-E5-35) curled severely at its edges during vacuum heat treatment.
For this polymer, four individual sample layers needed to be stacked in order to survive
a 3-year exposure. Therefore, the four layers were stacked together (after mass measure-
ments were obtained) and held ﬂat by mounting them in an aluminum holder for ﬂight
(similar to the one used for the Kevlar fabric).
4.4. Pre-flight dehydrated mass measurements
Pre-ﬂight mass measurements were obtained with dehydrated sample sets (after vacuum
heat treatment were applicable). Sample sets were dehydrated in a vacuum desiccator
maintained at a pressure of 80—133 Pa (60—100 mtorr) with a mechanical roughing pump.
Typically five ﬂight sample sets and their corresponding baCk-up sets were placed together
in a desiccator (a total of 10 groups of samples). The sets of samples were placed in the
desiccator in a particular order and left under vacuum for a minimum of 4 days. The

vacuum desiccator was put under vacuum immediately after a sample set was removed to
keep additional sample sets stored under vacuum. Previous tests showed that the mass of
a dehydrated sample was not adversely affected if the desiccator was opened and quickly
closed again and pumped back down to approximately 20 Pa (150 mtcrr) prior to that
sample being weighed. This process allows multiple samples to be dehydrated together.
The time at which the sample was first exposed to air was recorded along with the times
at which it was weighed. A total of three mass readings were obtained and averaged.
The total time it took to obtain the three readings, starting from the time air was let into
the desiccator, was typically 5 min. The samples were weighed using either a Mettler
Balance 3M (0.000001 g sensitivity) or a Sartorius Balance R160P (0.00001 g sensitivity),
depending on their total mass. Records of the following were kept: the sequence of sample
weighing, the number of samples in each set, the time under vacuum prior to weighing,
the temperature and humidity in the room, the time air was let into the desiccators the time
a sample was taken out of the desiccator, the time of each weighing and the mass. The
same procedure and sequence was repeated with the same samples post-ﬂight.
4.5. Density data
Density measurements were obtained for 36 0f the 41 polymers using calibrated density
gradient columns. The density solvents for the maj ority of polymers were made from ce-
sium chloride (CsCl), which has a density of approximately 2 g cm‘3, and water (H20),
which has a density of 1 g cm‘3. A more dense solution and a less dense solution were
mixed from the solvents, and the more dense solution was slowly added to a 50 mL bu-
ret with increasing amounts of the less dense solution until only the less dense solution
was being added, creating the density gradient. Because of the variation of density in
the polymers, columns with variations in the initial mixed solutions were made to accom-
modate a wider range of densities to be determined. Glass standards of known densities
(i 0.0001 g cm‘3) were placed in t0 the column. Data were obtained by placing very
small pieces of the polymers into the column and noting their respective positions after
setting. The sample densities were then obtained from a curve fitted from the standards.
As one example, for a density column with a density range of 1.4—1.6 g cm‘3, the more
dense solution was made with a density of 1.65 g cm‘3 (13 mL CsCl and 7 mL of H20) and
the less dense solution was made with a density of 1.38 g cm‘3 (38 mL CsCl and 62 mL of
H20). The density solvents for the higher density polymers, such as the ﬂuoropclymers,
were carbon tetrachloride (CC14), which has a density of 1.594 g cm‘3, and bromoform
(CHBr3), which has a density of 2.899 g cm‘3. The densities for five polymers were ei-
ther out of the range of the density columns 0r of a form not easily sectioned for density
column measurements. The densities for these materials (acrylonitrile butadiene styrene
(ABS), polyethylene (PE), polypropylene (PP), polyphenylene isophthalate (PPPA) and
pyrolytic graphite (PG)) were obtained from referenced literature or manufacturers’ Ma-
terials Safety and Data Sheets.

(POM, 2—E5-12 through PEO, 2—E5-17) are expected to have high erosion yields, samples within the
solid line block are from the polyimide family and samples within the dashed line block are from the
fluoropolymer family.
4.6. Area measurements
The exposed sample area was determined by measuring the diameter of the sample tray
opening using digital calipers. Each specific tray opening was measured at 10 different
diameter orientations to determine an average diameter. This diameter was then used to
compute the sample area exposed to LEO A0 for each sample position.
5. FLIGHT SAMPLE MOUNTING (TRAY E5)
The MISSE PEACE Polymers resided in sample tray E5, which holds a total of 46 1-
inCh-diameter ﬂight samples. The PEACE Polymer samples start in the top row, sixth
sample position from the left (i.e. ABS, with serial number 2-E5-6, represents a sample
in MISSE Passive Experiment Container (PEC) 2, tray E5, sample position 6). Five other
samples (four DC 93-500 silicone samples and one A0 scattering Chamber) were also on
this tray, in positions 2-E5-1 through 2-E5-5. Sample positions were Chosen based on
their anticipated erosion yields or by grouping samples by polymer family (such as the
polyimides). High erosion yield samples were located next to the silicone samples as the
high erosion yield samples were less likely to be affected by silicone cross-Contamination.

(MISSE)
Managed by Langley Research Center (LaRC), MISSE is a collaborative effort among
NASA centers, the US Air Force and private industry [7]. MISSE consists of suitcase-

7. MISSE 2 ENVIRONMENTAL EXPOSURE
The MISSE 2 PEACE Polymers A0 exposure is described in Section 8 below. Esti-
mated environmental conditions of solar exposure, tray temperatures, and ionizing radi-
ation doses 011 MISSE 1 and 2 are described in detail by Pippin [8]. For the PEC 2 tray
(exposed to A0 and solar radiation) the total equivalent sun hours (ESH) was estimated to
be 5000—6700 ESH. This total includes Earth-reﬂected illumination (650—820 ESH). The
spectrum of Earth reﬂection solar radiation has a reduced contribution from the vacuum
ultraviolet (UV) portion of the spectrum due to absorption by the Earth’s atmosphere [8].
Tray E5 was computed to have received approximately 6300 ESH. Pippin also describes
the baseplate thermal cycling temperature range for MISSE 1 and 2 to be nominally be-
tween +40 and —30 0C With occasional short—term excursions to more extreme tempera-
tures. The 3.95 year exposure duration in LEO resulted in approximately 22 800 thermal
cycles. Preliminary data from [8] also provided insight into the ionizing radiation enVi-
ronment 0n MISSE 1 and 2. Data from thermo-luminescent dosimeters (TLDs) With thin
shielding layers are most relevant to estimates of doses for the PEACE Polymer experi-
ment thin polymer films. The TLD data indicated receiving approximately 26 krads(Si)
through 0.005 cm aluminum for MISSE 2 [8].
Black light inspection of the trays showed minimal to no contamination 0n the MISSE
surfaces [8]. Results of X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) contamination analysis

of two MISSE 2 sapphire witness samples in tray E6 (located next to tray E5) indicated an
extremely thin silica contaminant layer (1.3 and 1.4 11m 011 each slide, respectively) [9]. A
small amount of ﬂuorine was also detected [9].

The MISSE 2 environment was found to be an unusually Clean environment with very
low spacecraft—induced molecular contamination. This is due to low outgassing of other
MISSE 2 Tray 1 materials, and also due to the position of MISSE 2 0n ISS. Therefore,
the ﬂight data was not affected by contamination. This further increases the importance
of this long-duration ﬂight data.

CHARACTERIZATION
Figure 4 is a post-retrieval photograph of the PEACE Polymers experiment tray as ob-
served directly after PEC 2 was opened for the first time in a NASA Langley Research
Center Clean room. As expected, many of the polymer samples were significantly de-
graded, and the process of eroding through the various sample layers was evident. Fig-
ure 5 is a post-ﬂight photograph of the PEACE Polymers experiment (tray E5) after de-
integration from MISSE PEC 2.

Fortunately, even though this experiment received nearly 4 years of atomic oxygen
exposure, material was left for all samples except for one (PBI, 2-E5-35). Therefore,
planning for a 3-year exposure (vs. 1 year) was found to be crucial to the experiment’s
success.

Once tray E5 was brought back to NASA Glenn Research Center, post—ﬂight photo-
documentation of the samples was conducted. Photographs were taken of the individual
samples in tray E5, after removal from the tray (left in a ﬂight stack next to the back-
up stack), and also with the individual sample layers spread out. Details on the number
of sample layers eroded through, those textured, and the number non-eroded layers were
recorded. When additional stacked layer sets had been placed behind the weighed sample
set as a ﬂight sample, those two groups of sample sets were separated for weighing as
individual sets, when possible. Post—ﬂight, an ideal situation would be where only the
weighed set had erosion, so that the unweighed stacked layers did not need to be weighed
post—ﬂight for erosion yield determination. Occasionally, the individual layers could not
be separated from each other without damaging the sample texture or losing gossamer
pieces of residual material. In these cases all layers were kept together for post—ﬂight
sample weighing.

For post—ﬂight mass measurements, there were three situations: (1) either a single
sample layer was ﬂown, or an unweighed Part B set of sample layers was ﬂown behind
the weighed Part A set, but erosion only occurred within the Part A layers (hence the Part
B layers did not need to be weighed post—ﬂight), or only a single sample layer was ﬂown.
These ideal situations are referred to as the “Single” situation. (2) Both a weighed Part A
set and an unweighed Part B set were ﬂown and erosion occurred through the Part A set
down into Part B, and the two sets of layers could be separated and weighed individually
post—ﬂight (this is referred to as the “Separate” situation). (3) Or both a weighed Part A set
and an unweighed Part B set were ﬂown and erosion occurred through Part A down into
Part B, and the two sets of layers could not be separated post—ﬂight without damaging the
gossamer sample layers, and therefore the sample sets were weighed together post—ﬂight
(this is referred to as the “Together” situation). As stated before, the post—ﬂight mass

procedures replicated the pre-ﬂight mass procedures in terms of the vacuum dehydration
process (dehydration time, sample order, weighing technique) as Closely as possible.

Figures 6—8 provide examples of the “Single” situation. In figure 6 a single thick
(0.203 cm) layer of pyrolytic graphite (PG, 2-E5-25) was ﬂown and the ﬂight sample is
shown post-ﬂight next to the non-ﬂown control sample. Mass loss was therefore computed
simply from the dehydrated mass prior to, and after ﬂight, of this single layer.

The UpileX-S sample (2-E5-32) provides another example of the “Single” situation.
Figure 7 shows a post-ﬂight photograph of the stacked ﬂight sample next to a stacked
baCk-up (control) sample. A total of 11 layers were stacked together and ﬂown. The
individual layers are shown in figure 8 along with the baCk-up sample. Pre-ﬂight, the top
six of 11 layers were weighed. During ﬂight only the top four layers were eroded (the
top two were completely eroded leaVing the E5 tray-protected ring, the third layer was
eroded with holes at the A0 textured cone valleys, and the fourth layer was eroded at the
cone valley hole locations in the third layer). Therefore, post-ﬂight, the top siX layers

were separated from the bottom five layers and only the top set was weighed and directly
compared with the mass of the top siX layers pre-ﬂight for ﬂight sample mass loss.

Atomic oxygen ﬂuence witness sample Kapton H (2-E5-30) provides an example of
a “Separate” situation. As shown in figure 9, three 0.0127 cm thick layers were ﬂown.
Prior to ﬂight only the top two layers were weighed. During ﬂight, A0 eroded the top
layer completely and eroded the second layer resulting in the development of the cone-
lil<e texture. There were holes in the bottom of the cone valleys that provided exposure
to the sample layer below. Even though the second layer was still intact (and could be
weighed as a separate layer), the third layer was also textured. Therefore, in this case,
pre-ﬂight and post—ﬂight mass measurements are needed for both the weighed top two
layers and the bottom unweighed layer, which were obtained separately.

Figure 10 provides a schematic diagram of a situation where a stack of unweighed
layers has been ﬂown behind a weighed layer set and during ﬂight AG has eroded through
the weighed set into the unweighed set. In this situation, the pre-ﬂight mass of the Part
B set (MB) needed to be computed. This mass was computed based on taking an average

9. MISSE 2 TRAY 1 E5 A0 FLUENCE
The A0 ﬂuence for PEC 2 tray 1 E5 was computed based on the mass loss of two Kapton
H witness samples (2-E5-30 and 2-E5-33). Each Kapton H witness sample consisted of
three 0.0127 cm thick layers for a total thickness of 0.0381 cm. As stated previously,
Kapton H is commonly used for ﬂuence calibration because it has a well-Characterized
erosion yield in LEO (3.0 x 10‘24 atoms cm‘z) [4]. The A0 ﬂuence was determined
using vacuum-dehydrated mass loss based on two techniques: (1) averaging the first three
mass readings, and (2) baCk-extrapolation 0f the mass data to time zero using linear curve
fits to get theoretically dehydrated mass values. The results of these measurements are
provided in table 3. The A0 ﬂuence values for the individual samples using the same
technique were very similar. The average AO ﬂuences for the two techniques were also
very similar. Therefore, it was decided to use the average mass value instead of the linear
baCk-extrapolation value for determining both the LEO AO ﬂuence for the experiment and
for determining the erosion yield values for the individual PEACE Polymer samples. The
average AO ﬂuence for the PEACE Polymers experiment exposure (tray E5) on MISSE
2, based on the two Kapton H witness samples (averaging the first three mass readings),
was determined to be 8.43 x 1021 atoms cm‘z.

11. SUMMARY and CONCLUSIONS

Forty-one different polymer samples, collectively called the PEACE Polymers, have been
exposed to the LEO space environment on the exterior of the 18$ for 3.95 years as part
of MISSE 2. The Objective of this experiment was to accurately determine the atomic
oxygen erosion yield of a wide variety of polymeric materials after 10ng-term exposure
to the space environment. The MISSE 2 PEACE Polymers experiment was exposed to
atomic oxygen along with solar and Charged particle radiation. Mass loss was determined
to be the best technique for Characterizing the atomic oxygen erosion yield values for this
experiment because erosion sometimes occurred in underlying layers at “cone valleys” in
partially eroded upper layers, and because some layers were fragile gossamer films.

Atomic oxygen erosion yield values were determined for the MISSE 2 PEACE Poly-
mers experiment based on mass loss obtained before and after ﬂight using vacuum dehy-
drated samples. Exposure areas were determined from individual ﬂight sample hardware
openings. Density values for 36 0f the 41 polymers were obtained using calibrated den-
sity gradient columns. The A0 ﬂuence for the experiment was determined based on two
Kapton H witness samples. Back—extrapolation 0f the mass data to time zero (to get a the-
oretically dehydrated mass), as compared to using the average mass values, indicated no
significant difference in A0 ﬂuence between these techniques. The average AO ﬂuence
for the MISSE 2 PEACE Polymers experiment (MISSE 2, tray 1, sample tray E5) was de-
termined to be 8.43 x 1021 atoms cm‘2 based on average mass values. As some samples
may have a synergistic effect of solar exposure on AO erosion, it is important to note that
the solar exposure for tray E5 was computed to be approximately 6300 ESH. There was
partial or complete erosion of six of the 41 ﬂight samples, and hence the erosion yield val-
ues for these samples are greater than the value reported. Planning for a 3 year exposure
(vs. 1 year) was found to be crucial to the success of this experiment.

The MISSE 2 PEACE Polymers experiment is unique because it contained the widest
variety of well Characterized polymers ﬂown in LEO for a long duration under identical
conditions. In addition, this experiment was exposed to an unusually low contamina-
tion environment. The data from this LEO ﬂight experiment provide extremely valuable
atomic oxygen erosion yield data for spacecraft design and predictive model development
purposes.
