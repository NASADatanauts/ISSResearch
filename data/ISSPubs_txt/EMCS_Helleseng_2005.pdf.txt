The European Modular Cultivation System (EMCS) provides a fully controlled system dedicated
primarily to experiments using plants, but also insects, amphibians, cell and tissue cultures. The
EMCS is the only plant cultivation system With an on-board 1 g-reference, Which is scheduled for
early utilization 0n the International Space Station (188).
The EMCS is an experiment facility for biological investigations under microgravity, Which allows
the cultivation, stimulation, and creW-assisted operations of biological experiments under well-
controlled environments. Conditions such as temperature, atmospheric composition, water supply,
illumination, observation and acceleration 0n centrifuges Will be controlled.
The Norwegian User Support and Operations Centre (N—USOC) located in Trondheim, Norway has
been appointed as the EMCS Facility Responsible Centre (FRC) by BSA. The N—USOC is respon-
sible for the implementation of the ISS ground segment for EMCS operations preparation, real-
time data dissemination and provisions for instantaneous experiment command processing. N—USOC
will also offer scientiﬁc and technical support to Principal Investigators (PIs) WhO have been se-
lected for EMCS experiments.
