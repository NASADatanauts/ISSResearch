Abstract: We have shown using ESA’s Biopan facility ﬂown in Earth orbit that when exposed to the space
environment for 2 weeks the survival rate of Synechococcus (Nageli), a halophilic cyanobacterium isolated
from the evaporitic gypsum—halite crusts that form along the marine intertidal, and Halorubrum chaoviator a
member of the Halobacteriaceae isolated from an evaporitic NaCl crystal obtained from a salt evaporation
pond, were higher than all other test organisms except Bacillus spores. These results led to the EXPOSE-R
mission to extend and reﬁne these experiments as part of the experimental package for the external platform
space exposure facility on the ISS. The experiment was ﬂown in February 2009 and the organisms were
exposed to low-Earth orbit for nearly 2 years. Samples were either exposed to solar ultraviolet
(UV)—radiati0n (7» > 110 nm 0r 7» > 200 nm, cosmic radiation (dosage range 225—320 mGy), 0r kept in
darkness shielded from solar UV-radiation. Half of each of the UV-radiation exposed samples and dark
samples were exposed to space vacuum and half kept at 105 pascals in argon. Duplicate samples were kept in
the laboratory to serve as unexposed controls. Ground simulation control experiments were also performed.
After retrieval, organism Viability was tested using Molecular Probes Live—Dead Bac—Lite stain and by their
reproduction capability. Samples kept in the dark, but exposed to space vacuum had a 90 i 5% survival rate
compared to the ground controls. Samples exposed to full UV-radiation for over a year were bleached and
although results from Molecular Probes Live—Dead stain suggested ~ 10% survival, the data indicate that no
survival was detected using cell growth and division using the most probable number method. Those samples
exposed to attenuated UV-radiation exhibited limited survival. Results from of this study are relevant to
understanding adaptation and evolution of life, the future of life beyond earth, the potential for
interplanetary transfer of Viable microbes Via meteorites and dust particles as well as spacecraft, and the
physiology of halophiles.
