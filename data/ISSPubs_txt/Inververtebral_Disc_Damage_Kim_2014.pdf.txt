ARTICLEINFO ABSTRACT
Article history: Heavy backpacks are often used in extreme environments, for example by military during combat,
RECEiVEd 29 MarCh 2013 therefore completion of tasks quickly and efﬁciently is of operational relevance. The purpose of this study
ACCEptEd 13 AugUSt 2013 was to quantify hemodynamic parameters (brachial artery Doppler and microvascular ﬂow by photo—
— plethysmography; tissue oxygenation by near—infrared spectroscopy; arterial oxygen saturation by pulse
Keywordsf oximeter) and sensation in upper extremities and hands (Semmes—Weinstein monoﬁlament test and 2—
Earetheftlﬁemit point discrimination test) while wearing a loaded backpack (12 kg) in healthy adults for 10 min. All
31121: d ﬂow y values were compared to baseline before wearing a backpack. Moderate weight loaded backpack loads
signiﬁcantly decreased upper extremity sensation as well as all macrovascular and microvascular he—
modynamic values. Decreased macrovascular and microvascular hemodynamics may produce neuro—
logical dysfunction and consequently, probably affect ﬁne motor control of the hands.
