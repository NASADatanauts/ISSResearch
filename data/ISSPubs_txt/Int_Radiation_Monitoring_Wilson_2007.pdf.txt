Abstract
Anisotropies in the low Earth orbit (LEO) radiation environment were found to inﬂuence the thermoluminescence detectors (TLD)
dose Within the (International Space Station) ISS 7A Service Module. Subsequently, anisotropic environmental models With improved
dynamic time extrapolation have been developed including westward and northern drifts using AP8 Min & Max as estimates of the his—
toric spatial distribution of trapped protons in the 1965 and 1970 era, respectively. In addition, a directional dependent geomagnetic
cutoff model was derived for geomagnetic ﬁeld conﬁgurations from the 1945 to 2020 time frame. A dynamic neutron albedo model based
on our atmospheric radiation studies has likewise been required to explain LEO neutron measurements. The simultaneous measurements
of dose and dose rate using four Liulin instruments at various locations in the US LAB and Node 1 has experimentally demonstrated
anisotropic effects in ISS 6A and are used herein to evaluate the adequacy of these revised environmental models.
