"2","Abstract

Limited data are available to describe the regulation of heart rate (HR) during sleep in
spaceﬂight. Sleep provides a stable supine baseline during pre-ﬂight Earth recordings for
comparison of heart rate variability (HRV) over a wide range of frequencies using beth
linear, complexity, and fractal indicators. The current study investigated the effect of
long-duration spaceﬂight 011 HR and HRV during sleep in seven astronauts aboard the
International Space Station up to six months. Measurements included ECG waveforms
from Holter monitors and simultaneous movement records from accelerometers before,
during, and after the ﬂights. HR was unchanged inﬂight and elevated post-ﬂight
(59.6i8.9 bpm compared with pre-ﬂight 53.3i7.3 bpm, P < 0.01). Compared with pre-
ﬂight data, HRV indicators from both time domain and power spectral analysis methods
were diminished inﬂight from ultra-low to high frequencies and partially recovered to the
pre-ﬂight levels after landing. Complexity and fractal properties of HR were not different
from pre-ﬂight during inﬂight and post-ﬂight. Slow ﬂuctuations (< 0.04 Hz) in HR
presented moderate correlations with movements during sleep partially accounting for the
reduction in HRV. In summary, substantial reduction in HRV was observed with linear,
but not with complexity and fractal, methods of analysis. These results suggest that
periodic elements that inﬂuence regulation of HR through reﬂex mechanisms are altered
during sleep in spaceﬂight but that underlying system complexity and fractal dynamics
were not altered.

"3","Introduction

Human spaceﬂight dramatically alters cardiovascular demands of day-to-day work
tasks (18) and eliminates the need for the normal regulatory adjustments of the
cardiovascular system associated with postural change on Earth (9, 47). Without
appropriate countermeasures including regular exercise there would be marked
cardiovascular deeonditioning that could be detected by changes in heart rate (HR) and
heart rate variability (HRV) (55). For more than 40 years, researchers have reported that
inﬂight HR might be reduced (19, 22, 25, 35), elevated (9, 25), or unchanged (2, 11, 21,
46, 52) compared to pre-ﬂight measurements. Interpretation of these ﬁndings is
complicated by uncertain conditions for data collection. However, recent investigations
of astronauts 0n the International Space Station (188) reported no change from pre-ﬂight
resting HR under controlled conditions in space (2, 26, 52).

Measurement of HRV has likewise been complicated by the variable conditions of
data collection. An early report of 24-hour HRV from cosmonauts 0n the Russian MIR
station (21) observed a reduction in low frequency spectral power during days 3-7, but no
changes over the remainder of the ﬂight (up to 179 days). Another study from MIR
reported that HRV during short sessions of paced breathing was generally reduced in
long-duration spaceﬂights compared to pre-ﬂight supine values (11). Data from three
recent investigations of astronauts on 188 have revealed some conﬂict. HRV was
unchanged from pre-ﬂight semi-recumbent values except for a strong trend (P=0.07)
during 0.1 Hz controlled breathing (2), no changes were observed from supine rest in a

3

"
"4","second study (52), but we found in astronauts investigated in the current study that high
frequency HRV was reduced (26).

To avoid some of the complications of altered patterns of daily activity and effect of
body posture, sleep might yield important information 011 the fundamental nature of
cardiovascular regulation. Several investigators have reported that compared to pre-ﬂight
values there was no change in the sleep time HR during spaceﬂight (18, 19, 46) and one
study reported no change in the long-term scaling (fractal) behavior of HR (HRV)
compared to healthy controls (28). However, another study reported lengthening of RR-
interval by about 100 ms and no change or an increase in high frequency HRV (22). To
date, 110 study has incorporated simultaneous measurement of movement indicators with
collection of HR data during sleep to assist in interpretation of the data. The mean HR
during sleep has been previously reported for the astronauts in the current study as being
unchanged during ﬂight (18) and therefore we hypothesized that HRV will likewise be
unchanged compared to pre-ﬂight values while post-ﬂight HRV will be reduced.

Methods
Subjects

Seven astronauts (1 female, age 47i4.6 year, height 176i5.0 cm, weight 81i9.6 kg)
participated space missions aboard the 188 (52 — 199 (144i49) days) were studied. Each
subj eet was given full verbal and written details of the experiment and signed a consent
form. The experiment protocol conformed to the guidelines in the Declaration of Helsinki
and was approved by the Ofﬁce of Research Ethics at the University of Waterloo, and the
Committee for the Protection of Human Subj eets at J ohnson Space Center.

Protocol and Data Collection
4

"
"5","Measurements were obtained in four test sessions for each subj eet: 41i30 days
(minimum 18 days) before ﬂight (pre-ﬂight), 2-3 weeks after launch (early inﬂight), 2-3
weeks before landing (late inﬂight), and 1 day (11:5), 2 days (n=1), or 3 days (11:1) after
return to Earth (post-ﬂight). Pre-ﬂight tests were performed at the J ohnson Space Center,
Houston, TX (11:4) and the Gagarin Cosmonaut Training Center, Star City, Russia (11:3).
Post-ﬂight tests were completed at the Kennedy Space Center, Cape Canaveral, FL (11:3),
the J ohnson Space Center (11:1, landed at the Dryden Flight Research Center), and the
Gagarin Cosmonaut Training Center (11:3).

111 each test session, subj eets were asked to wear Holter monitors (designated as HMl,
Digieorder Model 483, Del Mar Reynolds Medical 1110., Irvine, CA for the ﬁrst two
subj eets and the early inﬂight session of the third subj ect, and HM2, H12+ Holter,
Mortara Instrument, Milwaukee, WI for all other sessions) for at least 24 hours to collect
the ECG waveforms. Simultaneously, movements were recorded by accelerometers
(Aetiwateh-L AW-7, MiniMitter, Bend, OR) placed 011 subj eet’s ankle and wrist of the
dominant limbs. The Aetiwateh captured the highest activity or movement amplitude in
each second and output the summation of counts every 15 seconds. The inﬂight raw data
were downlinked and pre-proeessed by support personnel at J ohnson Space Center.

Data collected during sleep were analyzed in this study. Data for mean heart rate and
activity patterns at different times of the day have been described for these same subj eets
(18). The sleep period in each session was manually identiﬁed based on markedly
reduced activity level in that period. Then, a segment of steady data was taken from the
sleep period for subsequent analysis (see Fig. 1). In each subj eet, the data length used for
analysis was the same for all four test sessions (i.e., the shortest segment identiﬁed

5

"
"6","among the sessions) in order to diminish the inﬂuence of data length on HRV indices
(33). In this way, the data length varied between 1.5 and 4 hours.
Data Analysis

The raw ECG waveforms were ﬁrst analyzed by Holter scanning software
(Impresario, Del Mar Reynolds Medical Inc., Irvine, CA and H-Seribe RX, Mortara
Instrument, Milwaukee, W1) to obtain beat-by-beat time series of RR—interval. The RR-
interval series were inspected for inappropriate (e.g., selection of T-wave as R-wave) or
missing (e.g., failure to detect the R-wave) identification of heartbeats and ﬁltered when
necessary as previously described (18, 57). Brieﬂy, ectopic intervals with absolute beat-
to-beat HR variation > 20 bpm were identiﬁed and ﬁltered by adjusting 0r inserting
heartbeats t0 the time series respectively. The ﬁltering process was not always necessary
for the sleep data because of limited motion artifact during sleep. Indeed, only the late
inﬂight record of one astronaut was substantially improved by the ﬁltering. Then, indices
of HR and HRV were calculated from each RR-interval series by linear time and
frequency domain methods as well as complexity and fractal analysis, which were
implemented in MATLAB (MathWorks, Natick, MA).

Time domain parameters included 1) mean HR, 2) standard deviation of the RR-
intervals (SDRR) indicating the overall HRV, 3) standard deviation of the averaged RR-
intervals over 5 minutes (SDARR), which estimates the slow components (i.e., low
frequency) of HRV, and 4) square root of the mean squared differences of successive RR-
intervals (RMSSD) representing the fast components (i.e., high frequency) of HRV (33).

Frequency domain parameters were derived from the power spectral analysis of the
RR-interval series. Four frequency bands were deﬁned as recommended in (33): ultra-
6

"
"7","low frequency (ULF, 3 0.003 Hz); very low frequency (VLF, 0.003 — 0.04 Hz); low
frequency (LF, 0.04 — 0.15 Hz); and high frequency (HF, 0.15 — 0.4 Hz). The RR-interval
series was ﬁrst resampled at 2 Hz by cubic spline interpolation. Then the power spectral
density of the series was estimated Via Welch’s method (56). The time series was divided
into four segments (Hanning windowed) with 80% overlap so that all the segments would
have sufﬁcient data length (2 3375 seconds) to generate ULF spectral component (33, 45).
Next, the respiratory frequency (RF) was estimated as the frequency corresponding to the
HF peak in power spectral density. Finally, spectral powers in the four frequency bands
(P_ULF, P_VLF, P_LF, and P_HF), the total power from all four frequency bands
(P_TOT), and the ratio of LP to HF power (LF/HF) were calculated. Consistent with
several previous studies (2, 7, 24, 45), large inter-individual variance in spectral powers
was observed. Therefore, spectral powers were normalized by the total power from all
four test sessions (NP_ULF, NP_VLF, NP_LF, NP_HF, and NP_TOT) in order to
minimize the inter-subj ect variation while retaining the changes of HRV under different
conditions. For example, NP_ULF was computed as follows:
NP_ULFsession = P_ULFsession / (P_ULFpre-ﬂight + P_ULFearly inﬂight + P_ULFlate inﬂight +
P_ULFpOSt_ﬂight) (1)
where session = pre-ﬂight, early inﬂight, late inﬂight, 0r post-ﬂight. The power spectral
analysis was also performed 011 shorter data sets to assess the short-term modulation of
HR. Speciﬁcally, each RR-interval series was divided into 5-minute segments and the
power spectral index was calculated for all the short segments, the median of which was
taken as a representative value.
7

"
"8","Complexity and fractal dynamics of HRV were assessed by sample entropy (SampEn)
and the detrended ﬂuctuation analysis (DFA) respectively. Sample entropy is a measure
of complexity (i.e., irregularity) of a time series (30, 42). DFA is a technique to extract
the pattern of signal amplitude with changing time scales (i.e., fractal dynamics) (3, 37,
42), with smaller sealing exponent 0t indicating higher unpredictability of the time series
and Vice versa. Both techniques have demonstrated abilities to reveal changes of HRV
dynamics associated with various conditions such as aging, sleeping, pregnancy, and
disease (3, 28, 29, 37, 53). In the current study, SampEn was computed for each RR-
interval series with a pattern length of 2 data points and a tolerance threshold of 0.15,
which was widely adopted in HRV studies (10, 31). Similar to power spectral analysis,
short-term SampEn was calculated as well from 5-minute data segments using the same
procedure. The DFA sealing exponent 0t (a-DFA) was estimated with maximum window
size of one fourth of the time series length (37).

Linear regression analysis was employed to evaluate the contribution of movements
to HRV. Movement counts measured from ankle and wrist were first averaged to present
the overall movement patterns during sleep. Then, the movement powers were calculated
in ULF and VLF bands (LF and HF powers were not available as the movement series
was sampled every 15 seconds (0.067 Hz)). Brieﬂy, the time period between each two
adj aeent movement events in the averaged movement series was ﬁrst identiﬁed and
converted to frequency. Next, the movement power at this speciﬁc frequency was
calculated from the movement counts in the two adj aeent events. In the end, all the
obtained movement powers were integrated in ULF and VLF bands respectively. The
above method, rather than conventional power spectral analysis, was applied to cope with

8

"
"9","impulse train shaped movement measurements during sleep. Finally, correlation
coefﬁcients (r) as well as P-Values between movement power and HRV were calculated
in ULF and VLF bands pooled over all test sessions and all subj ects.
Statistics

Data were presented as means i SD. One-way repeated measures ANOVA was
applied to test differences across the four ﬂight conditions (pre-ﬂight, early inﬂight, late
inﬂight, and post-ﬂight), followed by Student-Newman-Keuls post-hoe test. A P-Value
less than 0.05 was considered signiﬁcant. Statistical analyses were performed with
SigmaPlot (Systat Software 1110., San Jose, CA).

Results

Inﬂight vs. Pre-flight

Inﬂight, mean HR was maintained at the pre-ﬂight level as summarized along with all
other data in Table 1. On the other hand, inﬂight HRV indices in time domain (SDRR,
SDARR, and RMSSD) were reduced from pre-ﬂight values by 33 — 42% 011 average. The
reductions were signiﬁcant except for SDARR during late inﬂight. Consistent with their
time domain counterparts, inﬂight spectral powers were lower than the pre-ﬂight values
by 49 — 67% 011 average, although the ULF, VLF, and LF power reductions showed no
statistical significance likely due to large inter-subj eet variations. Normalization of
spectral powers, as expected, attenuated the standard deviations and revealed significant
decrements 0f HRV in all frequency bands. No signiﬁcant difference was found in LF/HF
ratio, SampEn, and a-DFA from pre-ﬂight t0 inﬂight.

9

"
"10","Ankle movement was much lower during ﬂight while wrist movement remained
unchanged compared with pre-ﬂight values. The resulting inﬂight overall movement
counts were signiﬁcantly lower than the pre-ﬂight level.

Post-flight vs. Pre-flight and Inﬂight

Post-ﬂight HR was greater compared with both pre-ﬂight and inﬂight values by ~5
bpm (Table 1). SDRR and SDARR recovered towards pre-ﬂight levels upon return to
Earth (P > 0.05 vs. pre-ﬂight, P < 0.05 vs. inﬂight) while post-ﬂight RMSSD remained
lower (P < 0.01 vs. preﬂight). The frequency domain post-ﬂight HRV indiees showed
similar patterns of recovery toward pre-ﬂight values except for P_HF and NP_HF (P <
0.05 vs. pre-ﬂight). The LF/HF ratio was slightly but not signiﬁcantly elevated. SampEn
and a-DFA post-ﬂight were not signiﬁcantly different from either pre-ﬂight 0r inﬂight
values.

Upon return to Earth, the movement counts were higher than inﬂight values (P <
0.01). The wrist and overall movement levels after landing also exceeded pre-ﬂight
values (P < 0.05).

Movement and HR V

Fig. 2(a) illustrates time series of RR-interval and overall movements for pre-ﬂight
and inﬂight recordings from one astronaut as well as the RR-interval power spectra.
Reductions 0f inﬂight HRV from pre-ﬂight in all four frequency bands were noticeable.
Fig. 2(a) further reveals temporal agreement of events when movement counts increased
and RR—interval decreased. Fig. 2(b) shows the linear regression between movement
power and HRV in ULF and VLF bands. Quantitatively, the regression analysis revealed
moderate but signiﬁcant correlation between movement power and HRV in both ULF (r

"
"11","= 0.63, P = 0.003) and VLF (r = 0.40, P = 0.03) bands, indicating a reasonable
contribution of movement to slow ﬂuctuations in HR.
Short-term HR V

Table 2 summarizes the short-term HRV indiees derived from the median value of the
5-minute data segments from each subj eet by power spectral analysis and sample entropy
method. Although there were differences in the absolute values when comparing the
short-term HRV of Table 2 t0 the long-term HRV values in Table 1, the comparisons
between the time points yielded essentially identical statistics as their counterparts in
Table 1.

Discussion

The novel ﬁnding of the current study was the marked reduction in time and
frequency domain indicators of HRV while sleeping during spaceﬂight even though there
was no change in mean HR. These results contrast with our hypothesis and with a
previous investigation of cosmonauts sleeping on the MIR station where HR was lower
but there was no change or a small increase in HF HRV (22). The results also differ from
the recent report of no change in HR 0r HRV in volunteers conﬁned for 105 days in a
spaceﬂight simulation (54). The reductions in HRV power in ultra-low and very low
frequencies could be explained in part by parallel reductions in the patterns of movement
during sleep at these same frequencies. In the low and high frequency bands for HRV the
reductions in power during sleep were unlikely to be associated with movement; rather,
other mechanisms associated with cardiovascular regulation need to be considered.
Interestingly, the complexity and fractal dynamics of HR were unaltered by spaceﬂight.

1 1

"
"12","The spectral power indices in the low and high frequency bands as well as the SampEn
results were further conﬁrmed by short—term HRV analysis (see Table 1 and 2).
Mean HR

As we have previously reported 011 different data segments from the same astronauts
(18), mean HR in sleep was not different from pre-ﬂight values during both early and late
inﬂight testing. This was consistent with some previous research (19, 46) but contrasts
with the prolongation of RR-interval in MIR cosmonauts (22). Post-ﬂight (1 — 3 days
after landing) HR during sleep was elevated by ~5 bpm, suggesting that gravitational
stimuli may affect the autonomic control system and invoke a tachycardie response even
without orthostatic stress. More specifically, blood volume is reduced in space (9) and
might not have recovered, while redistribution of blood ﬂow occurs upon return to Earth
even in supine position (i.e., shift towards one side of the body). Either of these factors
could have contributed to baroreeeptor stimulation reducing parasympathetic and/or
enhancing sympathetic nerve activity to increase HR. The overall reduction in movement
during sleep was not sufﬁcient to alter the mean HR.

Inﬂight HRVin LF and HF

Limited data during sleep in spaceﬂight have provided evidence of unchanged or a
small increase in high frequency HRV (19, 22). As well, recent data indicated no change
in sleep time HRV during simulated spaceﬂight in the Mars 500 pilot study (54).

The HF component of HRV is considered to be related to parasympathetic nervous
control 011 HR while the LF variability is modulated by both sympathetic and
parasympathetic nervous systems (38). During sleep, vagal activity is dominant in
healthy humans (20, 51). In the present study, inﬂight mean HR was maintained at the

12

"
"13","pre-ﬂight level. Thus the marked reduction of inﬂight HRV in LF and HF was more
likely to reﬂect smaller ﬂuctuations in HR regulatory systems rather than a resetting of
tonic autonomic modulation level. The reduced and more evenly distributed blood
volume in space is likely to cause smaller ﬂuctuations in venous return and cardiac ﬁlling,
and the resulting attenuation in blood pressure variability was translated into reduced
HRV by the baroreﬂeX regulatory system (4, 12). In these same astronauts studied under
controlled conditions while awake, there was a signiﬁcant reduction in HF HRV with no
change in LF HRV (26). Coincident with the change in HF HRV were signiﬁcant
reductions in HF power for the estimated stroke volume and arterial pulse pressure, as
well as non-signifieant reductions in LF power for these same variables. It is possible that
during sleep similar changes in stroke volume and pulse pressure contributed to the
reductions in both LF and HF HRV, but this cannot be confirmed as blood pressure was
not measured.

HR ﬂuctuations in LF and HF bands are also modulated by respiration (8, 15). Higher
respiratory rate and smaller tidal volume are associated with decreased HRV in LF and
HF with unchanged mean HR due to the kinetics of sinoatrial node responses to
acetylcholine (8, 15). In the current study, inﬂight respiratory frequency was slightly but
signiﬁcantly higher than pre-ﬂight (Table 1), which was consistent with previous
observations of astronauts during sleep (44). Therefore, reduction of inﬂight HRV may
also be attributed to higher respiratory rate. Indeed, linear regression analysis between
respiratory rate and normalized HRV powers showed signiﬁcant correlations in VLF (r =
-0.46, P = 0.01), LF (r = -0.50, P = 0.007), and HF (r = -0.49, P = 0.008) bands. Although
measurement or estimate of tidal volume was not available, recent studies have shown

13

"
"14","similar or reduced tidal volume in space compared with pre-ﬂight value measured in
supine posture (40, 41, 44).
Post-flight HR Vin LF and HF
In the ﬁrst days after landing, LF and HF HRV powers during sleep tended to recover,
but there was still a 19% reduction in LF and a 40% reduction in HF compared to pre-
ﬂight. The tendency of post-ﬂight recovery in LF and HF powers could be a result of
combined effects from 1) restoring blood volume; 2) gravitational stimuli; 3) sustained
higher respiratory rate (Table 1); and 4) possibly decreased post-ﬂight baroreﬂeX
sensitivity (26). The post-ﬂight elevation of mean HR indicated a shift in the balance
between parasympathetic and sympathetic activation that affected HRV, which was not
detected as a signiﬁcant increase in post-ﬂight LF/HF ratio due to large inter-subj eet
variance. Indeed, post-ﬂight LF/HF ratio was much larger than pre-ﬂight in three subj eets,
marginally increased in two subj eets, and lower than pre-ﬂight in two subj eets.
HRVin ULF and VLF

Mechanisms causing ULF and VLF components in HRV are incompletely understood
(6, 33). VLF HRV is mainly effected by modulation of parasympathetic activity (49) and
this is reﬂected by the dramatic reduction in HRV in these frequency bands by atropine
(58). Variation in the mean level of parasympathetic activity is unlikely in the current
study given the unchanged inﬂight HR. Additional mechanisms inducing HRV in the
ULF and VLF bands are suggested to include renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (1,
49), thermoregulation (17, 27), and physical activity (5, 36, 43, 45).

14

"
"15","Elevated levels of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system during spaceﬂight (14)
might be associated with reduced HRV in the VLF frequency band in the current study. It
is unlikely that thermoregulatory effects contributed during the 1.5 -4 hour data segments.

Physical activity affects long-term ﬂuctuations in HR under daily routines (5, 36, 43,
45). Although movement was limited during sleep, our results revealed moderate
correlations between overall movements and HRV in both ULF and VLF.

Complexity and F metal Dynamics ofHRV

The ﬁnding of no difference in a-DFA between pre-ﬂight and inﬂight values was
similar to the observation of IvanOV et al. who compared healthy subj eets during sleep on
Earth with astronauts during sleep in orbit (28). There was also no signiﬁcant difference
in the SampEn with spaceﬂight. The overall observations in the current study suggest that
the complexity and fractal properties of HRV were not changed by spaceﬂight in contrast
to the observed changes in the linear components. These results are consistent with the
hypothesis of Yamamoto and colleagues that the linear and fractal mechanisms regulating
HRV are distinct (58). Post-ﬂight, SampEn and a-DFA were almost identical to the pre-
ﬂight values indicating stability in this aspect of cardiovascular control even though there
were small but significant increases in HR and reduced HF HRV compared to pre-ﬂight.
Limitations

One maj or limitation of the study was the lack of polysomnography recordings. Sleep
structure has been documented to change during spaceﬂight (13, 23, 34). We noted
reduced inﬂight movements during sleep that might be associated with reduced sleep-
disordered breathing (16). Reported impairment of sleep quality during spaceﬂight could
be associated with factors such as variable light-dark cycle, altered circadian rhythm,

1 5

"
"16","microgravity, confinement, and workload (13, 23, 34). The potential of better sleep based
on observations of reduced movement and HRV in the current study could be linked to
regular exercise as a countermeasure that facilitates the adaptation of circadian
rhythmieity (34). Nevertheless, without polysomnography it is likely that our data
crossed sleep stages which could alter HRV (48, 50, 53). To test for potential impact of
sleep phase, the same time and frequency domain analysis methods were applied on the
first 1.5 hour data during sleep (presumably within the ﬁrst sleep cycle). The resulting
HR and HRV indices were similar to those in Table 1 (results not shown) suggesting that
the effect of microgravity 0n HRV was probably predominant over that of different sleep
stages. However, incorporating polysomnography into studies of sleep structure effect 011
HRV during spaceﬂight is warranted in future studies.

The second limitation of the study was that the power spectral analysis assumes data
stationarity, which is normally not the case for RR-interval time series (32, 39). Thus, a
test for weak stationarity was implemented (3 9). Each RR-interval series was divided into
segments with length of 300 samples. From these, a subset was randomly selected for
short-term stationarity testing. This procedure was repeated for 500 iterations and the
averaged percentage of stationary segments was calculated to be 29.8i9.4%, 29.4i9.1%,
31.9i8.7%, and 25.7i7.3 for series during pre-ﬂight, early inﬂight, late inﬂight, and post-
ﬂight sessions respectively, indicating short-terrn non-stationarities 0f the RR-interval
series during sleep. Even smaller percentage stationarity would be expected with longer
data and data collected during day time. Although power spectral analysis is the standard
method in HRV studies, methods suitable for non-stationary series (e.g., wavelet
transform analysis) should be considered in HRV analysis.

16

"
"17","The scheduling of post-ﬂight tests (1-3 days after landing) was set to investigate the
immediate effect of the restoration of gravity on cardiovascular function but does include
stressful re-adaptation. Additional tests following a recovery period after landing would
be helpful to assess the cardiovascular adaption after return to Earth. The small sample
size in the current study was another limitation which may diminish the statistical power
of the data. Lastly, the movement data were recorded by the accelerometer and sampled
at a low rate (15 seconds per sample). Therefore, activities in LF and HF bands were not
accessible. Fortunately, movements are commonly related to ULF and VLF powers of
HRV and the sampling rate of 1/ 15 Hz is sufﬁcient to provide information in these two
frequency bands.

Perspectives and Significance

The effects of long-duration spaceﬂight 0n the cardiovascular regulatory systems
were assessed in terms of HR and HRV. The current results showed that unequivocal
alterations occurred in the linear, but not the complexity and fractal, indicators of cardiac
rhythm control mechanisms during sleep in astronauts living on the 188 up to six months.
The wide scale impact on linear HRV from the ULF t0 the HF regions of the power
spectrum compared to Earth suggest multiple rhythms are altered by spaceﬂight
including altered sleep pattern affecting movements, oscillations in the renin-angiotensin-
aldosterone system, and gravitational effects on blood volume distribution in the body
and within a respiratory cycle. These results provide new insights into the adaptations of
the human cardiovascular regulatory system under microgravity and suggest that future
studies need to include quantitative measurements of sleep stage and detailed
investigations of mechanisms proposed for the alterations in HRV.
