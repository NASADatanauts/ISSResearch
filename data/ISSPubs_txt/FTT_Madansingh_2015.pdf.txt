Bed rest subjects, including bed rest controls (10 BRC) and bed rest exercisers (16 BRE). Samples
Vestibular—somatosensory convergence were analyzed three times pre—exposure, immediately post—exposure (O or 1—day post)
and 2—3 times during recovery from the unloading environment. Two 3D inertial
measurements units (XSens MTx) were attached to subjects, one on the head and one
on the upper back. This study focused primarily on the yaw movements about the
subject's center of rotation. Time differences (latency) between head and trunk movement
were averaged across a slalom obstacle portion, consisting of three turns (approximately
three 600 turns). All participants were grouped as ‘decreaser’ or ‘increaser’, relating to
their change in head—to—trunk movement latency between pre— and post—environmental
adaptation measures. Spaceﬂight unloading (155) showed a bimodal response between the
‘increaser’ and ‘decreaser’ group, while both bed rest control (BRC) and bed rest exercise
(BRE) populations showed increased preference towards a ‘decreaser’ categorization,
displaying greater head—trunk locking. It is clear that changes in movement strategies are
adopted during exposure to an unloading environment. These results further the under—
standing of vestibular—somatosensory convergence and support the use of bed rest as an
exclusionary model to better understand sensorimotor changes in spaceﬂight.
