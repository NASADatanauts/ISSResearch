21 Abstract
22 Long duration habitation 0n the International Space Station (188) is associated with chronic
23 elevations in arterial blood pressure in the brain compared to normal upright posture on Earth,
24 and elevated inspired C02. Although results from short duration spaceﬂights suggested possibly
25 improved cerebrovascular autoregulation, animal models provided evidence of structural and
26 functional changes in cerebral vessels that might negatively impact autoregulation with longer
27 periods in microgravity. Seven astronauts (1 woman) spent 147i49 days 011 188. Pre-ﬂight
28 testing (30-60 days before launch) was compared to post-ﬂight testing 011 landing day (n=4) or
29 the morning 1 (n=2) or 2 days (11:1) after return to Earth. Arterial blood pressure at the level of
30 the middle cerebral artery (BPMCA) and expired C02 were monitored along with transcranial
31 Doppler ultrasound assessment of middle cerebral artery blood ﬂow velocity (CBFV).
32 Cerebrovascular resistance index was calculated as (CVRi=BPMCA/CBFV). Cerebrovascular
33 autoregulation and C02 reactivity were assessed in a supine position from an autoregressive
34 moving average (ARMA) model of data obtained during a test where two breaths 0f 10% C02
35 were given 4 times during a 5min period. CBFV and Doppler pulsatility index were reduced
36 during -20 mmHg lower body negative pressure, with no differences pre- to post-ﬂight. The
37 post-ﬂight indicator of dynamic autoregulation from the ARMA model revealed reduced gain for
38 the CVRi response to BPMCA (P=0.017). The post-ﬂight responses to C02 were reduced for
39 CBFV (P=0.05 6) and CVRi (P=0.047). These results indicate that long duration missions 0n the
40 188 impaired dynamic cerebrovascular autoregulation and reduced cerebrovascular C02
41 reactivity.

44 Introduction
45 The microgravity environment, which causes cephalic ﬂuid shifts with increased arterial
46 pressure at the level of the brain relative to normal daily life on Earth (17), might cause
47 alterations in oerebrovasoular structure and function. The impact of microgravity on human
48 oerebrovasoular function has primarily been examined during and after short—duration
49 spaceﬂights (2; 5; 8; 20) with only a few measurements of cerebral blood ﬂow velocity (CBFV)
50 during or after long-duration ﬂights (2; 33). During spaceﬂight, only modest changes in CBFV
51 have been reported (2; 5) with small increases in oerebrovasoular resistance after months in space
52 that were speculated to reﬂect increased sympathetic vasoconstriction (2). Post-ﬂight CBFV in
53 the supine posture was unchanged or slightly elevated from pre-ﬂight (8; 20). Post-ﬂight
54 measurements of dynamic oerebrovasoular autoregulatory indices, reﬂecting vascular smooth
55 muscle responses to changes in arterial blood pressure, were slightly enhanced in one group of
56 astronauts (20) but were reduced in astronauts with reduced post-ﬂight orthostatio tolerance (8).
57 Results from Earth-based analogs of spaceﬂight using head down bed rest (HDBR) have
58 revealed increases (21), decreases (2; 4; 14; 18; 32) or no changes (2; 3; 29; 38) in supine CBFV.
59 After HDBR, some studies have shown a greater reduction in CBFV with lower body negative
60 pressure (LBNP) (3 8) or assuming an upright posture (21) suggesting an impairment in the
61 ability to regulate cerebral blood ﬂow when faced with an orthostatio stress. However, other
62 research has found no difference in oerebrovasoular responses to tilt or LBNP (3; 4) or with rapid
63 deﬂation of leg cuffs (29).
64 Animal models of spaceﬂight using hind limb suspension have provided convincing
65 evidence of cerebrovascular structural and functional changes. Cerebral arteries from suspended

"

66 rats have demonstrated vascular smooth muscle hypertrophy (24; 34; 36; 37) with a smaller
67 luminal oross-seotional area (36) and increased basal myogenio tone (16; 24; 35). Further work
68 has also shown that these changes are associated with reduced cerebral blood ﬂow (34; 35) and
69 greater vasoconstriotor responses possibly acting through nitric oxide-dependent (24; 30; 35) or
70 renin-angiotensin system-dependent mechanisms (6).
71 To date, there have been no investigations of the oerebrovasoular response to carbon
72 dioxide (C02) after spaceﬂight. Cerebrovascular C02 reactivity reﬂects endothelial function
73 through activation of the nitric oxide system (22; 23; 31) that was impaired in animals by hind
74 limb suspension (24; 30; 35). In addition, oerebrovasoular C02 reactivity might also be altered as
75 a consequence of elevated partial pressure of C02 in the ambient air on the International Space
76 Station (188) that could chronically inﬂuence arterial C02 (PaCOz) and cerebral aoid-base
77 balance.
78 We hypothesized in the current study that resting CBFV would be unchanged following
79 long-duration spaceﬂight but there would be greater decreases with LBNP. Further, we
80 hypothesized that post-ﬂight oerebrovasoular autoregulation would be impaired and C02
81 reactivity would be blunted as a consequence of chronic effects of the ISS environment.

83 Methods
84 Cerebral hemodynamio data from long-duration spaceﬂight were collected as a part of the
85 Cardiovascular and Cerebrovascular control on return from the International Space Station
86 (CCISS) proj eot. Methods and procedures were reviewed and approved by the Ofﬁce of
87 Research Ethics at the University of Waterloo and the Committee for the Protection of Human
88 Subj eots at J ohnson Space Center. Each volunteer signed an approved consent form after

89 receiving full verbal and written details of the experiment. The experiment conformed to the
90 guidelines in the Declaration of Helsinki.
91 Seven astronauts (1 woman) with an average age of 48i4 years participated. Pre-ﬂight
92 data were collected 36i22 days prior to launch. Post-ﬂight data were collected from astronauts
93 returning Via the space shuttle within 3-4 hours of landing (R+0, n=4) and, for astronauts
94 returning Via the Russian Soyuz spacecraft, the morning after landing (R+1, n=2) or two
95 mornings after landing (R+2, n=1) for an astronaut whose return was delayed by weather. For
96 R+0 testing, the astronauts landed on the shuttle in a supine posture and remained in that posture
97 for transportation to the research facility and until the experiment was completed. Experiments
98 on days R+1 and R+2 were conducted ﬁrst thing in the morning. The astronauts did not assume
99 upright posture on test day before being transported to the laboratory in a supine posture in an
100 attempt to minimize the effects of re-adaptation to Earth’s gravitational environment. The
101 astronauts spent an average of 147i49 days in space ranging from 58 days to 199 days with all
102 but one spending greater than 100 days on orbit.
103 Experimental Protocol and Instrumentation
104 Pre-ﬂight testing for the shuttle-launohed astronauts and one Soyuz-launohed astronaut
105 took place at J ohnson Space Center (J SC, Houston, TX). Three of the four shuttle astronauts
106 completed post-ﬂight testing at Kennedy Space Center (KSC, Cape Canaveral, FL) with the
107 other at Dryden Flight Research Center (Dryden, Edwards, CA). Pre-ﬂight testing for two Soyuz
108 launched astronauts and all post-ﬂight testing was completed at the Gagarin Cosmonaut Training
109 Center (GCTC, Star City, Russia). Due to logistics of each location, slightly different equipment
110 was used at each of the experimental sites.

111 Throughout the testing periods, astronauts were equipped with a standard three lead
112 electrocardiogram (Finometer ECG Module (J SC, KSC, Dryden), Finapres Medical, Amsterdam,
113 the Netherlands; Hewlett-Packard (GCTC)) for the assessment of heart rate (HR). Arterial
114 pressure was continuously determined using ﬁnger photoplethysmography (Finometer (KSC,
115 J SC, and Dryden), Portapres (J SC 11:1), and Finapres (GCTC), Finapres Medical, Amsterdam,
116 the Netherlands) and height-eorreeted to heart level. The participants were also equipped with a
117 nasal cannula for monitoring of expired C02 (Ohmeda 5200 C02 Monitor (J SC, KSC, and
118 GCTC); ADInstruments C02 analyzer (Dryden)). End-tidal C02 values were converted to mmHg
119 based on atmospheric temperature and pressure (PETCOz). Transeranial Doppler ultrasound
120 (Multigon Industries, New York, NY (J SC); EZDop, DWL, Compumedies, Germany (KSC);
121 MultiFlow, DWL GmbH, Sipplingen, Germany (Dryden); CardioLab, European Space Agency
122 (GCTC)), was used for the assessment of CBFV in the middle cerebral artery (MCA). In all
123 locations TCD measures were conducted using a 2MHz pulsed Doppler probe that was placed
124 over the right temporal window to allow for the insonation 0f the M1 segment of the MCA and
125 the assumption of a 00 angle of insonation. To minimize effects of angle variation from pre- to
126 post-ﬂight, photographs were taken of probe placement in pre-ﬂight testing and used as a
127 reference for post-ﬂight tests. Throughout the testing, the probe was held in place using a
128 headband.
129 Testing that occurred at J SC, KSC, and Dryden utilized Chart software (ADInstruments
130 Ltd.) for the continuous recording of ECG, ABP, C02, and TCD signals. Data recorded at GCTC
131 also utilized Chart software for the recording of ECG, ABP, and C02. TCD data at GCTC were
132 recorded on a separate system using CardioMed software (European Space Agency). Chart data
133 were digitized at 1000Hz and CardioMed data at 100Hz. Beat-by-beat data from the CardioMed

"

134 system were aligned with Chart data by introducing a common marker signal, and by pattern
135 matching the between beat intervals from R-waves and TCD waves.
136 C02 and LBNP tests
137 Cerebral blood ﬂow was assessed under two different conditions: lower body negative
138 pressure (LBNP), and a C02 challenge using the “two-breath” test of Edwards et a1. (11). A11
139 testing took place with astronauts resting in a supine position. Two low levels of LBNP, -10 and
140 -20 mmHg, were applied for approximately 2 min at each level while the astronauts were sealed
141 at the waist into an airtight box. Vacuum was applied to the box to produce negative pressure
142 promoting a shift in blood volume towards the lower limbs.
143 The “two-breath” method (11) was used to assess both eerebrovaseular autoregulation
144 and cerebrovascular C02 reactivity. During this test, the nasal cannula was removed and a mask
145 was held in place over the nose and mouth. A valve was turned to control whether the astronaut
146 inspired room air or a gas mixture consisting of 10% C02, 21% 02, balance N2. Two breaths of
147 the C02 gas mixture were inspired every minute for a ﬁve minute period.
148 Data Analysis
149 The outer envelope of the TCD Doppler spectrum was averaged over each cardiac cycle
150 to determine mean CBFV. Similarly, arterial blood pressure tracings were averaged over a
151 cardiac cycle to provide an indication of beat-by-beat blood pressure at the level of the MCA
152 (BPMCA). Mean CBFV and BPMCA were then used to calculate an index of cerebrovascular
153 resistance (CVRi) as CVRi = BPMCA / CBFV. As an additional assessment of cerebrovascular
154 resistance the Gosling Pulsatility index was calculated as P1 = (CBFVsys-CBFVdia)/CBFVmean
1 5 5 (7).

156 During the LBNP section of the protocol, 30s averages of cerebrovascular variables were
157 taken starting 40s before the end of each stage for the steady state assessment at rest, -10mmHg,
158 and -20mmHg. The two-breath protocol was analyzed using autoregressive moving average
159 (ARMA) analysis on the beat—by-beat data set as previously described (11). The ARMA model
160 removes the mean value prior to computing gain for the input—output relationships. PCOZ was
161 determined for each heart beat by taking the point on the linear interpolation for end-tidal PC02
162 corresponding to each R-wave on the electrocardiogram. Based on the best fit ARMA model
163 parameters, the step gains were calculated as the values of CBFV and CVRi 45 s after the
164 introduction of nominal inputs of 1 mmHg change in BPMCA and 1 mmHg change in PC02 as
165 previously described by Edwards et a1. (11).
166 T echnical issues
167 Technical problems reduced the sample size for certain comparisons. A C02 analyzer did
168 not function during one post-ﬂight test so the C02 responses of this astronaut could not be
169 included in the ARMA analysis. In one astronaut the mean value of the TCD signal differed by
170 more than physiologically acceptable limits for pre- to post—ﬂight comparisons suggesting
171 possible differences in equipment or vessel investigation. Even so, the variability of the signals
172 appeared to be appropriate so this astronaut’s data were included when the mean values were
173 eliminated (e.g. ARMA analysis of CBFV) but were excluded when the absolute values were
174 important (e.g. calculation of CVRi and its subsequent analysis by ARMA). The data set of one
175 astronaut with a very low cardiac frequency would not solve with the ARMA algorithm. This
176 data set was linearly interpolated to double the mean sampling frequency before analysis. Testing
177 this approach on other data sets indicated no impact on model solution.
178 Statistical analysis

"
"9","Zuj et a1. Cerebrovascular response after long duration spaceﬂight 9
179 Two-way repeated measures analysis of variance was used to test pre- to post-ﬂight
180 effects of LBNP (SigmaStat 3.5 , Systat Software 1110., Chicago, IL). The magnitudes of the
181 impulse and step responses from the ARMA analysis were compared using a one-way repeated
182 measures analysis of variance for pre- to post-ﬂight effects. Statistical signiﬁcance was set at
183 p<0.05.
184 Results
185 There were no differences in resting CBFV, CVRi, 0r PI from pre- to post-spaceﬂight
186 during the LBNP phase of the study (Fig. 1). In response to LBNP, CBFV (panel A) and P1
187 (panel C) were reduced at -20mmHg with 110 changes in CVRi (panel B). BPMCA was not
188 different (P=0. 142) from pre- to post-ﬂight at rest (92.9i15.0 and 99.9i8.4 mmHg) or at -20
189 mmHg 0f LBNP (92.2i13.4 and 97.4i8.8 mmHg). Also, there were no differences in PETC02
190 (P=0.737) at rest from pre-ﬂight (42.3i2.5 mmHg) t0 post-ﬂight (42.7i1.2 mmHg), or at -20
191 mmHg LBNP from pre-ﬂight (42.4i3.0 mmHg) and post-ﬂight (41 .8i1 .9 mmHg).
192 The BPMCA and cerebrovascular responses to the two-breath test with intermittent
193 increases of inspired C02 are displayed for a typical subj ect in Fig. 2. The transient elevation in
194 PC02 reduced CVRi and resulted in increases in CBFV while BPMCA maintained spontaneous
195 variations without obvious effect of PC02.
196 Group mean responses from the ARMA analyses are displayed as the time course of
197 change to a unit input in BPMCA and PCOZ in Figure 3 and individual step responses in Figure 4.
198 When BPMCA was considered as the input signal the averaged gain value for BPMCA9CBFV was
199 not different pre- to post-ﬂight (-0.225i0.453 vs. 0.069i0.119 cm/s/rang BPMCA, P=0.13, Fig.
200 3A and 4A), but the BPMCA9CVRi gain was reduced 17% after spaceﬂight (0.035i0.007 vs.
201 0.029i0.005 units/mmHg BPMCA, P=0.017, Fig. 3C and 4C). The indicators of C02 reactivity

202 from the responses of CBFV and CVRi revealed a strong trend for reduced CBFV response from
203 pre- to post-ﬂight (2.113i1.228 vs. 1.300i0.595 cm/s/mmHg PC02, P=0.056, Fig. 3B and 4B)
204 and a reduction in the CVRi response (-0.038i0.018 vs. -0.027i0.012 units/mmHg PC02,
205 P=0.047, Fig. 3D and 4D).
206
207 Discussion
208 The maj 0r findings of this study showed that long-duration spaceﬂight was associated
209 with reductions in the indices of cerebrovascular dynamic autoregulation and C02 reactivity with
210 no differences seen in resting CBFV or responses to low levels of LBNP. These ﬁndings,
211 following long-duration spaceﬂight 0n the 188, were consistent with hypotheses that suggested
212 cerebrovascular consequences from chronic elevation in cerebral blood pressure and chronic
213 exposure to elevated atmospheric PC02. Our results contrast with improved dynamic
214 autoregulation after the short-duration Neurolab spaceﬂight mission (20) but are similar to
215 ﬁndings in astronauts who presented with orthostatic intolerance after spaceﬂight (8).
216 Cerebrovascular indicators at rest and during LBNP
217 We anticipated greater reduction in CBFV during LBNP after long-duration spaceﬂight
218 indicative of impaired cerebral blood ﬂow regulation, but both at rest and during LBNP the
219 CBFV, PI, and CVRi were unchanged from pre-ﬂight. Resting CBFV is expected to reﬂect the
220 metabolic demands of the brain (1; 27) as well as the constant inﬂuence of PaCOz (26; 27). Our
221 finding of no change in supine CBFV after spaceﬂight was consistent with other observations
222 after short (8; 20) and long-duration ﬂights (33). The unchanged estimate of PaCOz taken from
223 the end-tidal PCOZ made it unlikely that alterations in C02 had an effect on resting cerebral
224 blood ﬂow.

225 The potential effects of long-duration spaceﬂight 0n eerebrovaseular structure and
226 function have been inferred from HDBR studies with humans (2-4; 14; 18; 21; 29; 32; 38) and
227 from animal models of hind limb suspension (16; 24; 34-37). The human HDBR studies reported
228 variable results with increases, decreases and no change in CBFV. Animal models have revealed
229 reduced ﬂow (34; 35) accompanied by signiﬁcant structural changes with increased thickness of
230 vessel walls (24; 34; 36; 37) and reduced internal dimensions (36). The animal models also
231 suggested an involvement of renin-angiotensin system might in structural modiﬁcations with
232 hind limb suspension (6; 15). A11 up—regulation after 4-weeks, but not after 7-days, of proteins
233 involved in the synthesis of angiotensinogen and 0f angiotensin-II type-1 receptors was observed
234 in cerebral and carotid arteries, and these changes were associated with increased arterial wall
235 thickness (6; 15). Based on these results from animal models, it is possible that human cerebral
236 arteries might also undergo structural change with prolonged exposure to microgravity. At the
237 moment, it is not possible to rule out the possibility that, while CBFV was unchanged, cerebral
238 blood ﬂow might have been reduced as a function of a smaller middle cerebral artery. This can
239 only be tested in future studies by quantitative measurements of cerebral blood ﬂow or measures
240 of middle cerebral artery dimensions.
241 In the current study, CBFV was reduced during -20 mmHg 0f LBNP but there was 110
242 difference in this response from pre- to post-ﬂight. These results contrast with observations after
243 the short-duration Neurolab mission (20) where there was a smaller reduction in CBFV during
244 LBNP as well as during upright tilt compared to pre-ﬂight. Our LBNP results after long-duration
245 spaceﬂight were consistent with observations from cosmonauts after 6-months in space;
246 however, at greater levels of LBNP, cosmonauts showed a trend towards greater reductions in
247 CBFV after ﬂight (33). In the current study, it is therefore possible that -20 mmHg LBNP was

"
"12","Zuj et al. Cerebrovascular response after long duration spaceﬂight 12
248 not sufﬁcient to challenge cerebral blood ﬂow regulation, as these same astronauts only showed
249 small changes in post-ﬂight baroreﬂex function in the seated posture (19); therefore, it is still
250 possible that changes in CBFV might have occurred with greater levels of LBNP or in assuming
251 an upright posture. Reduced PI during LBNP might have reﬂected a relative reduction in
252 eerebrovaseular resistance under the conditions of constant PETC02 in the current study (7), but
253 there were no apparent pre- to post-ﬂight differences in this indicator of static eerebrovaseular
254 autoregulation.
255 Dynamic cerebrovascular autoregulation
256 Dynamic cerebrovascular autoregulation, in contrast to static autoregulation (1; 28), is an
257 index of the rapid responses of the eerebrovaseular system to acute changes in BPMCA (28). As an
258 inverse relationship eXists between the dynamic autoregulatory index and PC02 (10), it was
259 important that resting PC02 was not different from pre- to post-ﬂight and further that the
260 simultaneous effects of BPMCA and PC02 were accounted for by the ARMA model. The 17%
261 reduction in gain for CVRi relative to the change in BPMCA provided an index of impaired
262 dynamic eerebrovaseular autoregulation after spaceﬂight. Similarly, there was a trend towards a
263 reduced CBFV response to a change in BPMCA (P=0. 128). Reduced eerebrovaseular dynamic
264 autoregulation after long-duration spaceﬂight was consistent with some (38) but not all (29)
265 ﬁndings after HDBR, and with astronauts who had orthostatic intolerance after short-duration
266 spaceﬂights (8). Altered post-ﬂight eerebrovaseular control might reﬂect the structural and
267 functional changes observed in the animal models of spaceﬂight (24; 34; 36; 37).
268 Cerebrovascular reactivity to C 02
269 No previous investigation has examined cerebrovascular C02 reactivity after spaceﬂight.
270 Animal studies showing reductions in nitric oxide-dependent dilation of cerebral arteries after

"
"13","Zuj et a1. Cerebrovascular response after long duration spaceﬂight 13
271 hind limb suspension (24; 30; 35) suggested that the C02 response might be altered due to the
272 link between C02 induced dilation of human cerebral arteries and nitric oxide-dependent
273 mechanisms (12; 23; 31). C02 reactivity was investigated in the current study by the tWO-breath
274 method (11) Which accounts for the spontaneous variability in PC02 that can complicate
275 interpretation of cerebrovascular responses (11; 27). The reduced gain for the CBFV and CVRi
276 responses computed With respect to the input of PC02 support the hypothesis that the nitric
277 oxide-dependent dilatory mechanisms of the eerebrovaseular system might be impaired by long-
278 duration spaceﬂight.
279 The environment of 188 had an average inspired PC02 0f 3.34mmHg during the
280 experiments described in this study. This value is over 10-fold greater than ambient conditions
281 on Earth. Data from a clinical population suggest that chronic exposure to hypercapnia leads to
282 blunting of cerebrovascular C02 reactivity (9); however it is unclear if chronic exposure to
283 increased atmospheric PC02, as seen 011188, produces reductions in eerebrovaseular C02
284 reactivity in a healthy population. Slightly elevated inspired C02 might have had a chronic effect
285 011 PaCOz and arterial aeid-base Which could in turn affect cerebrovascular resistance. To date,
286 110 arterial blood samples have been taken 011188 to determine if changes in PaCOz have
287 occurred.
288 Individual variability and potential implications
289 The responses of dynamic autoregulation and C02 reactivity, and the pre- to post-ﬂight
290 differences varied between astronauts. Finding a range of pre-ﬂight baseline CBFV and CVRi
291 responses to the input of BPMCA (Fig. 4A, 4C) is similar to previous observations (11). Likewise,
292 differences between subj eets in C02 reactivity (Fig. 4B, 4D) are expected and might be related to
293 differences in nitric oxide-dependent dilation, but this was not directly tested. Of interest in the

"
"14","Zuj et a1. Cerebrovascular response after long duration spaceﬂight 14
294 current study is the magnitude of change following spaceﬂight. One individual (solid circle, Fig.
295 4) had the largest change from pre- to post-ﬂight in both CBFV and CVRi responses to BPMCA
296 along with one of the larger changes in response to PC02. The other astronauts had relatively
297 consistent changes. The functional consequences of these changes cannot be identiﬁed from the
298 current study; however, a recent study (8) noted that reductions in dynamic eerebrovaseular
299 autoregulation were associated with orthostatic intolerance. N0 tilt tolerance tests were
300 performed by the astronauts in the current study.
301 Implications of individual variability in the changes in cerebrovascular dynamic
302 autoregulation and C02 reactivity beyond orthostatic tolerance are not known. However, NASA
303 has recently identiﬁed idiopathic intracranial hypertension as a risk factor for post-ﬂight Visual
304 problems (13; 25). The current data showing a range of changes in post-ﬂight eerebrovaseular
305 responses might provide impetus to investigate the potential for transeranial Doppler
306 measurements to yield information on risk for these Visual problems.
307 Limitations
308 The sample size in the current study was small. We had 7 astronauts participate in the
309 study but technical limitations reduced our main comparison of CVRi responses to 11:5. C02 was
310 not available in one astronaut (this astronaut’s data were eliminated from all ARMA analyses but
311 were included in the LBNP portion of the study), and there were marked differences between
312 pre- and post-ﬂight CBFV in another astronaut suggesting that different arteries might have been
313 investigated (this astronaut’s data were eliminated from CVRi results but maintained for CBFV
314 as the delta response was assumed similar independent of artery). Further, it is acknowledged
315 that with data collection in several different locations, different equipment was used for data
316 collection possibly contributing to variability in the results. However, the consistent pattern of

317 response between astronauts suggests that equipment did not inﬂuence the main ﬁndings of this
3 18 study.
319 There were also differences in the timing of the post-ﬂight testing. Fig. 4 indicates the
320 individual astronauts according to their landing site which dictated whether tests were conducted
321 on R+0 (all shuttle landings, n=3 for this ﬁgure) or were on R+1 0r R+2 (Soyuz landings). For
322 shuttle landings, all astronauts were tested within 3-4h of landing and they had not been in an
323 upright position for more than a few seconds during transitions between the shuttle and crew
324 transport vehicle. For Soyuz landings, crew were upright at some times on landing day during
325 their return to Star City, but were transported the morning after their arrival to the laboratory
326 without assuming an upright posture for longer than toilet requirements. This provided a
327 situation as similar as possible to the shuttle crew. These preparations contributed to the similar
328 responses observed for most astronauts.
329 Conclusions
330 The current studies have shown a consistent impairment of dynamic eerebrovaseular
331 autoregulation and C02 reactivity in astronauts following long duration spaceﬂight; however,
332 there were between person differences in the magnitude of impairment. It is unclear at the
333 moment whether these changes have pathophysiological signiﬁcance associated with the
334 complications in Vision attributed to idiopathic intraeranial hypertension (13; 25). Future studies
335 should investigate pre- to post-ﬂight changes in transeranial Doppler indices of cerebral blood
336 ﬂow and C02 reactivity to determine if they are predictors of pathophysiological complications
337 resulting from long-duration spaceﬂight.

474 Figure 1: The mean values (i SD, 11:7) for CBFV (A), CVRi (B) and PI (C) in response to
475 LBNP are shown for pre-ﬂight (black) and post-ﬂight (open). P values for the main effect
476 of LBNP are shown on each panel. N0 statistical differences were seen With respect to
477 spaceﬂight.
478 Figure 2: Data set of one subj eet from the “two-breath” protocol. Tracing shows that, as
479 expected, two breaths 0f 10% C02 elicited an increase in CBFV and a reduction in CVRi
480 With minimal change in BPMCA.
481 Figure 3: The group mean ARMA analysis step responses are shown as a function of time for
482 pre- (solid line) and post-spaeeﬂight (dashed line). The ARMA model incorporates two
483 inputs (BPMCA and PC02) acting on a single output (CBFV 0r CVRi). The extracted
484 solutions are shown for BPMCA9CBFV (A, 11:6), PC029CBFV (B, 11:6), BPMCA9CVRi
485 (C, 11:5), and PC029CVRi (D, 11:5). * P<0.05 between the 455 plateau value pre- to post-
486 ﬂight, see Fig. 4 for exact P-Values.
487 Figure 4: Each astronaut’s pre- and post-spaeeﬂight gain values computed at 455 from the step
488 responses of the ARMA analysis are shown for BPMCA9CBFV (A, 11:6), PC029CBFV
489 (B, 11:6), BPMCA9CVRi (C, 11:5), and PC029CVRi (D, 11:5). Solid lines and symbols
490 connect pre- to post-spaeeﬂight values for shuttle landed astronauts, open symbols and
491 dashed lines show the Soyuz landed astronauts. P-Values are for pre- to post-ﬂight
492 comparisons.
