Direct observation of the controlled melting and solidiﬁcation of succinonitrile was conducted in
the glovebox facility of the International Space Station (188). The experiment samples were
prepared on ground by ﬁlling glass tubes, 1 cm ID and approximately 30 cm in length, with pure
succinonitrile (SCN) in an atmosphere of nitrogen at 450 millibar pressure for eventual processing in
the Pore Formation and Mobility Investigation (PFMI) apparatus in the glovebox facility (GBX) on
board the ISS. ‘ . ' - .

Real time visualization during controlled directional melt back of the sample showed nitrogen
bubbles emerging from the interface and moving through the liquid up the imposed temperature
gradient. Over a period of time these bubbles disappear by dissolving into the melt. Translation is
stopped after melting back of about 9 cm of the sample, with an equilibrium solid-liquid interface
established. During controlled re—solidiﬁcation, aligned tubes of gas were seen growing
perpendicular to the planar solid/liquid interface, inferring that the nitrogen previously dissolved
into the liquid SCN was now coming out at the solid/liquid interface and forming the little studied
liquid = solid + gas eutectic-type reaction. The observed structure is evaluated in terms of spacing

* dimensions, interface undercooling, and mechanisms for spacing adjustments. Finally, the
signiﬁcance of processing in a microgravity environment is ascertained in view of ground-based
results.

Acutectic reaction can be deﬁned as an invariant point Where two (or more) distinctly different solid phases

simultaneously solidify from the parent liquid, i.e., Liquid 1 —-> Solid I + Solid II. This solidiﬁcation is a
complex process involving interactions of, among others, heat and mass transfer. The systematic investigation of

"2","eutectic alloys dates back to at least 1884 with the work of Guthriel. Since then our knowledge of eutectic
solidiﬁcation has advanced considerably as may be appreciated by the great number of references cited in texts and
review articles“. With the advent of directional solidiﬁcation techniques in the late 1940's, and their subsequent
reﬁnement, it was possible to accurately relate the spacing between respective phases to the processing parameters
of growth velocity (V), composition (C0), and temperature gradient (G). Not only was this a powerful investigative
approach, but also a practical technology that beneﬁted turbine blade processing through superior mechanical
properties resulting from alignment of the alternating phases. Other investigators found that magnetic?""19 and
electrical”26 properties of materials could also be inﬂuenced and usually improved.

' The eutectoid reaction (SI = SH + Sm) is the solid state equivalent of the eutectic and has also received
considerable attentionzul, especially in View of the commercially relevant austenite to pearlite (yFe = ocFe + F e3C)
transformation. In fact, a key point made in Zener's paper27 on the decomposition of austenite was incorporated into
the later eutectic analysis by J aekson and Hunt”. Like eutectics, when eutectoids are directionally decomposed an
aligned composite of alternating phases results. Interlamellar spacing measurements have been made on these alloys
with the N‘V = constant relationship again being reported. The eutectoid phase spacing is generally an order of
magnitude less than that measured for eutectics and is attributed to relatively slower. atomic movement as diffusion
must take place in the solid state.

Characteristic of monotectic: systems is a region of liquid immiscibility (L1 + Lu) and the monotectic reaction
point where Liquid I (L;) transforms to Solid I (SI) + Liquid II (Ln). During the transformation, Lu will either wet or
not wet 8153’56. In the former case, Lu is effectively pushed by the solidifying interface until it reaches a critical size,
after which it is overgrown and irregularly incorporated into the solid. This behavior is characteristic of ""low""
miscibility gaps such as seen in the Cu-Pb and Cd~Ga systems. On the other hand, when Ln preferentially wets S],
as in Al-Bi or Al-In, cooperative, diffusion controlled growth .3 r ._ v w r

some mechanical testing of gasar structures have been
made5 8'61. There has also been a theoretical study62 based on the Jackson-Hunt modelsz. Unlike the ﬁrst three
systems described above there has been no, to the best of our knowledge, systematic study regarding microstructural
development of the gasar and the role processing parameters such as growth velocity and temperature gradient can
play in modifying it. To shed light on these questions the work presented here utilizes transparent succinonitrile -—
nitrogen samples that have been directionally solidiﬁed in the quiescent microgravity environment available aboard
the International Space Station. Their transparent nature allows direct observation of the developing microstructure
and the microgravity environment precludes processing complications from thermosolutal convection that are well
demonstrated on Earth”. ~

3a) the interface temperature was ~55.7°C; for 6ttms‘l (Fig. Figure 313- As Fig. 3a, Growth Velocity = 3umS-l°

determination from inﬂections in the cooling curves is ongoing.

Figures 4a and 4b are representative of a ground—based test in which the sample is being solidiﬁed vertically
upward, i.e., the liquid is above the solid. Here the sample orientation is such that, being hotter on top, the liquid
should be stable and resist initiating convection currents. Unlike the space processed samples, maintaining a planar
interface was difﬁcult as can be seen in Figures 4a and 4b. The consequenceof gravity was further demonstrated as
the sample temperature had to be signiﬁcantly increased in order to move the interface into a position representative
of the ﬂight tests. Figure 4 does show nucleation and growth of gas tubes. In Figure 4a, to the left, a single thin,
tube is seen. In Figure 4b this tube is still growing and two new ones are seen to its left and one at the extreme right

"5","type reaction69. The resultant structure usually shows aligned pores but they are inconsistent in size and shape;
regardless, their application as metal foams has been suggested. Given the lack of a deﬁnitive study, it seems
reasonable to assume that the inconsistent morphology of gasar products can be attributed to processing conditions
that are constantly changing and, perhaps, from gravity induced convective effects at the interface and in the bulk
liquid. It is our conjecture that the samples melted and re-solidiﬁed in the PFMI apparatus aboard the 188 gives a
ﬁrst opportunity to at the least qualitatively evaluate the gasar reaction.

It is ﬁrst noted that the observation of aligned gas tubes was fortuitous. The primary intent of the PFMI
experiments was to investigate, bubble movements and interactions as they emerged from the solid during controlled
re-melting of the sample. To facilitate this objective'nitrogen bubbles were injected, via a long syringe, into the
sample tube while the liquid succinonitrile was solidifying."" This procedure effectively left a string of bubbles, '
generally centrally located, along, the length of the sample. It was subsequently observed that the bubbles released at
the interface would travel up the imposed temperature gradient and come to rest in the bulk liquid where the
temperature was uniform. Most of these bubbles would eventually dissolve effectively saturating the liquid. It is
also noted that, to our knowledge, the Succinonitrile-Nitrogen phase diagram is unknown. Work to this end is
ongoing at MSFC and to date it appears that the addition of nitrogen only very slightly lowers the melting point of
pure succinonitrile.

A number of factors, many introduced in the results section, give credence to the assumption that a growing solid
+ gas invariant “gasar” reaction is occurring and can be studied under controlled conditions. First of all, after a
sample is melted it is held for a period of time (~30 minutes) so that the imposed temperature gradient can establish
an equilibrium solid-liquid interface, and the dissolved gas is homogeneously distributed in the liquid through
diffusion. When controlled freezing of the sample is initiated the ﬁrst product to solidify from the liquid is a
“denuded” zone of pure succinonitrile. This continues for several millimeters after which bubbles ofgas are seen to
nucleate at the surface. These bu bbles are incorporated and form the basis for the subsequent tube growth, adjusting
their spacing as grow continues. Both observations are well documented in eutectic and monotectic studies.
Additional support detailing this as an invariant reaction comes from the measured drop in interface: temperature as
the growth velocity increases as well as the observed decrease in spacing and tube diameter. Finally, as detailed in
Table 1, the inter-rod spacing scales Well with other reactions if it is assumed that diffusion is enhanced due to one
of the product phases being a gas -

Table 1.0 Chart illustrating generally observed inter-phase spacing measurements from the products of
several invariant reactions. The spacing is ﬁnest in the fully solid-state eutectoid reaction where diffusion of
the rejected atoms to their respective product phases is most difficult.

It must be mentioned that the. above measurements and observations from the ﬂight samples are gleaned from
information currently available. For instance, the spacings seen in Figure 3 are from a camera mounted
perpendicular to the solid-liquid interface and represent what is seen at the tube interior. Additional and better
measurements could be made by examining the interior of the sample; this, unfortunately, is not possible because the
processed samples are still aboard the Space Station and not scheduled to be brought down until mid 2005.
Similarly, there are 5 6 video tapes that must be returned, many of which contain data that is not available due the
periods (Loss-of-Signal) when on—ground recording is not possible. F inally, in view of Figures 4 and 5, ground-
based attempts to evaluate gasar phenomena under controlled conditions appear somewhat futile. One might
consider thin cells, but the expected phase spacing (on the order of a millimeter) would likely defeat the intent.
However, in a complementary ground-based controlled directional solidiﬁcation experiment employing small
diameter capillary tubes, where convective effects are minimal, the role of processing parameters on. individual gas
tube growth and stability is being examined. The experiment allows the capability to examine the role of ambient
pressures, local gas saturation levels, and processing speeds on morphological development. Here molten
succinonitrile contained in the capillary tubes is saturated with nitrogen gas and processed in a directional
solidiﬁcation furnace. Figure 6. shows an individual tube grown during controlled directional solidiﬁcation at

V. Conclusions

A series of succinonitrile-nitrogen samples were melted and re-solidiﬁed under microgravity and controlled
processing conditions aboard the International Space Station. During solidiﬁcation aligned gaseous tubes were seen
to grow in the solid and perpendicular to the solid/liquid interface indicative of the so called “gasar” or LI ~—> SI + G1
reaction. Evaluation of the ﬂight samples showed that the rod spacing, and rod diameter, and interface temperature
decreased with increasing solidiﬁcation velocity; factors in agreement with eutectic growth theory and observations.
Gas rod nucleation, growth and spacing adjustments were seen to be similar to those seen in organic monotectic
reaction systems. Additional and detailed evaluations await return of samples and video tapes currently aboard the
ISS. Ground-based samples did little to support the ﬂight experiments. Similar processing conditions were difﬁcult,
if at all possible, to duplicate; this was particularly true of the samples solidiﬁed vertically upward.
