Radiation Measurements on the International Space Station

Abstract
The International Space Station (ISS) is becoming a reality with the docking of the Russian Service module (Zarya) with the Unity
module (Zaveda). ISS will be in a nominal 51.65-degree inclination by 400 km orbit. This paper reviews the currently planned
radiation measurements, which are in many instances, based on experiments previously ﬂown on the Space Shuttle. Results to be
expected based on Shuttle measurements are presented.
KEYWORDS: Radiation, space station, anthropomorphic phantom, risk.
