Abstract
Recently, large diameter, isolated n—heptane droplet experiments under microgravity conditions (aboard
the International Space Station) exhibited “C001 Flame” burning behavior, resulting from a heat loss mech—
anism that extinguishes hot combustion and a transition into a sustained, low temperature second stage
combustion. In atmospheric pressure air, a single combustion mode transition to “Cool Flame” burning
is followed by diffusive extinction. But With increasing pressure, multiple cycles of hot initiation followed
by transition to “Cool Flame” burning are observed. This paper reports experimental observations that
characterize the transition time histories of this multi—cycle, multi—stage behavior. Transient sphero—
symmetric droplet combustion modeling that considers multi—stage detailed kinetics, multi—component dif—
fusion, and spectral radiation is applied to analyze the experimental observations. The simulations indicate
that as parameters Change the chemical time scales dictating low temperature degenerate Chain branching,
multiple hot/cool ﬂame burning transitions are induced by increasing the cool ﬂame burning heat gener—
ation rate compared to the diffusive loss rate. The balance of these terms in the negative temperature
coeﬂicient kinetic regime deﬁnes Whether reactions accelerate into re—ignition of a hot ﬂame event, burn
quasi—steadily in the cool ﬂame mode, or diffusively extinguish. The rate of reactions controlling ketohydr-
operoxide formation and destruction are shown to be key re—ignition of hot combustion from the cool
ﬂame mode. Predictions are found to be in good agreement With the experimental measurements. Modeling
is further applied to determine how these observations are dependent on initial experimental conditions,
including pressure, and diluent species.
