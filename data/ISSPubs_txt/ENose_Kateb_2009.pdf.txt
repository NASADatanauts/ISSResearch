ARTICLE INFO ABSTRACT
ATtiCte history! A proof—of—concept study was done to determine whether an electronic nose developed for air quality
Recelved 10 February 2009 monitoring at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL) could be used to distinguish between the odors of organ

Hypothesis: We hypothesized that the JPL electronic nose (ENose) would be able to distinguish between the

Brain tumor overall array responses were compared to determine whether they were sufﬁciently different to allow the
Snifﬁng cancer organs and cell lines to be identiﬁed by their array responses.
Caheef Odor Results: The ENose was able to distinguish between the two types of organ tissue and between the two types
Ghomasmma of tumor cell lines. The variation in array response for the organ tissues was 19% and between the two types
Mdanoma of cultured cell lines was 22%.
Conclusion: This study shows that it is possible to use an electronic nose to distinguish between two types of
tumor cells and between two types of organ tissue. As we conducted the experiment with a sensor array built
for air quality monitoring rather than for medical purposes, it may be possible to select an array that is
optimized to distinguish between different types of cells and organ tissues. Further focused studies are
needed to investigate the odor signatures of different cells as well as cellular proliferation, growth,
differentiation and inﬁltration.
