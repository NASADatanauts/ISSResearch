Abstract
This study reports experimental evidence of gas phase micro—convection induced by support ﬁbers used
in droplet combustion experimentation. Soot aggregates formed during combustion of n—octane and n—dec—
ane droplets (initial diameters ranging from 0.5 mm to 5 mm) provide natural seeds to reveal the thermal
and ﬂow asymmetries involved. The experiments are carried out in an environment that reduces the inﬂu—
ence of forced and buoyant convection for both free—ﬂoating (unsupported) and ﬁber—supported droplets.
Under these conditions, the soot trapping patterns (due to a balance of thermophoretic and ﬂow—induced
drag) would be spherical. However, this situation is only observed for unsupported droplets, or for ﬁber—
supported droplets when the ﬁber is small relative to the droplet diameter. For D0 < 1 mm a ground based
drop tower employed two 14 am diameter SiC ﬁbers to ﬁX the droplet’s position during burning; unsup—
ported droplets were also examined. For DO > 1 mm the International Space Station provided capabilities
for anchoring test droplets onto a single 80 am SiC ﬁber, and for deploying unsupported droplets. Results
Clearly indicate that a non—symmetric gas ﬂow ﬁeld exists in some cases (i.e., for 1 mm < D0 < 3 mm, with
an 80 am ﬁber) near to where the ﬁber enters the droplet. This gas motion originates from the presence of
the ﬁber that introduces asymmetries in the temperature and ﬂow ﬁelds resulting in localized force imbal-
ances on the soot particles, which cause vortical ﬂow patterns near the ﬁber. This may in part be explained
by ﬂow asymmetries induced by droplet shape distortions coupled with heat exchanges between the ﬁber
and surrounding gas and conduction into the droplet, resulting in a Marangoni ﬂow near the droplet sur—
face. For very small ﬁbers (or for unsupported droplets) spherical soot shells are found suggesting that no
thermal and ﬂow asymmetries exist.
