The data from the R3DE instrument of ESA’S EXPOSE-E mission outside the 188 at the European Technological
Expose Facility (EuTEF) 0n the ESA Columbus module shows that the docking 0f the Space Shuttle with the
International Space Station (188) decreased the South-Atlantie Anomaly (SAA) maxima dose rates from about 1500
MGy h'1 down to 600-700 MGy h'1 or by factor of 2. The dose rate data at the same time from another Bulgarian built
instrument (R3DR) 0f the EXPOSE-R mission outside the Russian “Zvezda” module showed that: 1) before the
Space Shuttle docking, the SAA dose rates measured with R3DR were higher (2500 MGy h'l) than the R3DE data; 2)
The relative decrease of the SAA dose rates after the shuttle docking was only by a factor of 1.25. These differences
are explained by the smaller shielding of R3DR from the body of ISS and by the larger distance of it from the body
of Space Shuttle. Very similar data, but with smaller dose rates were Obtained with a third Bulgarian built instrument
(Liulin-S) inside Russian “Pirs” module. The analysis Of the ascending/descending SAA dose rate maxima of the
three instruments shows that the effect can be simply explained by the additional shielding against the 30 to 150
MeV protons of the SAA, provided by the 78 tons Shuttle t0 the instruments and by Changing of the 188 3D mass
distribution when the ISS rotates.

the attitude of 188, which usually rotates at 1800
