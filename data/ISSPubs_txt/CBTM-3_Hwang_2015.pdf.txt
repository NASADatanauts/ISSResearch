Introduction
Since the beginning of space travel, there have been reports of reoccurring/opportunistic infec-
tions during and post-spaceﬂight, likely resulting from immune suppression associated with
mission parameters. Cosmonauts developed acute respiratory issues after prolonged spaceﬂight
[1], and astronauts 0n Apollo and Skylab missions experienced increased infections [2, 3]. Pub-
lished reports documented an increase in reactivation of latent Viruses (Epstein-Barr Virus,
Cytomegalovirus, and Varicella-Zoster Virus) pre-, during, and post-spaceﬂight compared to
healthy ground control individuals [4—9]. Multiple factors were cited to alter host immune func-
tion of Viral control, with stress parameters being the marker of highest correlative value [10,
11]. Viral reactivation is often accompanied by elevated stress hormones, including cortisol, epi-
nephrine, and norepinephrine [5, 7, 12, 13]. Additionally, shifts in circulating cytokines towards
high levels 0f1L-4, IL-6, and IL-8 were observed in astronauts found shedding Viral particles [4].

Studies on spaceﬂight impact on immune function have been investigated through analysis
of blood leukocytes obtained from astronauts, cells secured from space ﬂown mice and rats,
and in vitro cell culture systems [14]. Several Changes in cell populations have been noted im-
mediately post-spaceﬂight, including decreased total leukocytes, decreased T-Cells (speciﬁcally
CD4+ T-Cells), increased monocytes, increased granulocytes, and decreased natural killer cells
[15—17]. However, reports of alterations in Circulating leukocytes populations isolated from as-
tronauts post-spaceﬂight are at best inconsistent; other analyses found no Changes in lympho-
cyte 0r monocytes populations [10, 18—21]. The inconsistency of the data is most likely due to
mission specific variables and individual health status.

The observed Changes in immune activity post-spaceﬂight involves both innate (macrophages
and NK cells) and adaptive (T-Cell) functions. This report represents the ﬁrst occasion of a de-
tailed analysis of both surface marker expression and response to stimulation parameters that
mimic a broad range of pathogen induced activation events. In order to answer these questions,
this study focused on mouse splenocyte composition and function immediately post 13 days of
spaceﬂight, utilizing animals that were part of the historic ﬁnal ﬂight of NASA’s Space Shuttle
Program (Space Shuttle Atlantis, STS-135). Innate stimulation 0ft011-1ike receptors (TLR), the
surface receptors that target molecular pathogenic patterns, examined activation events using ago-
nists employed primarily by bacterial or fungal agents. These included zymosan (TLR-2 agonist),
lipopolysacchride (LPS; TLR-4 agonist), and ﬂagellin (TLR-5 agonist).The adaptive stimulation
parameters included T-Cell stimulation using antibodies to stimulate CD3 (T-Cell receptor) and
CD28 (T-Cell CO-receptor), or via mitogen, concanvalin A, to bypass the CD28 co-receptor.

Analysis of mouse splenocytes focused on Changes in surface marker expression for T-Cells
and dendritic cells (DCs), marking a distinction between innate and adaptive immunity. DCs
activate upon innate TLR stimulation, leading to increased expression of antigen presentation
molecules (MHC I and II) and CO-stimulatory molecules (CD86 and 80). Upon cell-cell contact
with DCs, CD8+ (MHC 1) 0r CD4+ (MHC II) T-Cells are activated by antigen recognition
through the T-cell receptor (CD3 is the signal transduction region) and the CO-stimulatory
molecule CD28. The goal of these studies was to determine the inﬂuence of spaceﬂight on im-
mune activity known important for translating innate immune responses to long-lasting T-cell
hypersensitive activity.

Materials and Methods

Flight Information: Subjects and Spaceflight

This study was conducted as a subset of a larger parent ﬂight investigation identiﬁed as Com-

mercial Biomedical Test M0dule-3, designed to determine if administering an experimental

agent preﬂight reduces the loss of bone associated with spaceﬂight [22]; multiple investigators
shared materials collected post ﬂight [23—27]. For the parent study, mice (“ﬂight mice”) were
ﬂown onboard Space Shuttle Atlantis, mission STS-135, for approximately 13 days. For this
immune-speciﬁc sub-study, approximately 1/2 spleen from siX C57BL/ 6 mice (Charles River, 9
weeks of age at start of ﬂight) were made available immediately following spaceﬂight. The sub-
jects were ﬂown in a Space Shuttle Animal Enclosure Module (AEM), which was housed in the
mid-deck area of the vehicle for the duration of the spaceﬂight. Spleens from siX ground-based
control mice, which were handled and housed in a ground-based identical manner (AEM mod-
ule) t0 the ﬂight mice were included in the study. The AEM module housing conditions for
control mice have been well described [28]. AEM ground control mice received vehicle control
diluting agent.

The mice were part of the NASA Ames Research Center’s Biospecimen Sharing Program
(http://www.nasa.g0V/ames/research/space-biosciences/cbtm-3-sts—135). Flight experiments
were designed to investigate effects of microgravity on vascular atrophy in mouse hindlimbs.
We are aware that among our siX ﬂight mouse subjects, four were treated with a bone-specific
medication and two were untreated. For purposes of this article, analysis was conducted on all
siX ﬂight subjects as a group, without knowledge of treatment, and data were compared to
ground AEM control subjects. The individual mice that were drug or placebo treated remained
unknown during experimentation; data presented here was not separated according to treat-
ments. To our knowledge, there was no inﬂuence of medication on the data collected. Separate
analysis of data did not indicate statistical outliers within the combined spaceﬂight mice, which
would indicate affects due to treatment. In light of this, we believe our findings are relevant and
important, even in light of inclusion of mice that received the bone loss experimental drug.
Mouse Splenocytes Processing
Animals were retrieved approximately 1 hour following deorbit, and sacrificed within 3—5
hours post ﬂight, collected on July 21, 2011 at Kennedy Space Center (Cape Canaveral, FL).
Mice were euthanized using 4% isoﬂurane followed by cardiac puncture and exsanguinations
[28]. Half of the spleen was processed as previously described [28]. Brieﬂy, the organ was
homonenized between glass slides, RBC lysed with ACK buffer (Lonza), washed twice with 1X
Cellgro Dulbecco’s Phosphate Buffer Saline (PBS, Mediatech), and cultured in complete
DMEM media [Dulbecco’s Modified Eagles Medium (Sigma) supplemented with 2.2g/L sodi-
um bicarbonate, 0.05g/ L of HEPES (Sigma), 0.05g/ L L-arginine (Sigma), 100 pg/mL penicillin
G (Sigma), 50 pg/mL gentamycin sulfate (Sigma) 0.005% 2-mercapt0ethan01 (Gibco), and 10%
fetal bovine serum (Sigma)] at 1X106ce11s/mL. Processing of splenocytes for in vitro analysis oc-
curred within 4 hours post ﬂight. The animal welfare committee at the University of Texas
Health Science Center was consulted prior to initiation of experimentation; n0 protocol was re-
quired as samples used were obtained post euthanasia. A11 NASA actiVities with these mice
were performed according to guidelines stipulated in the Guide for the Care and Use of Labora-
tory Animals as described by the National Institutes of Health. Experiments were performed
after approval by reView boards associated with NASA’s standard operating procedures, and as
reported for tissue used in recent reports [26, 28].

Bead Uptake Assay

Splenocytes were cultured with 1.0pm FluOSpheres polystyrene microsphere (Invitrogen) at
ratio of 10 beads per 1 cell. At 2 hours, cells were washed with 1X PBS, fixed with 4% parafor-
maldehyde for 15 minutes on ice, and stored in ﬂow buffer (1% BSA in 1X PBS) for analysis.

Stimulation Assays
Isolated splenocytes were cultured for 24 hours in media alone or stimulated with 1) anti-CD3
(0.1pg/mL) and anti-CD28 (0.1pg/mL) antibodies (eBiosciences), 2) Zpg/mL Concanavalin A
(ConA, Sigma), 3) 200ng/mL lipopolysaccharide (LPS, 01112B4, Sigma), 4) 10pg/mL Zymosan
(Saccharomyces cerevisiae, Invivogen), 0r 5) 100ng/mL ﬂagellin (Salmonella typhimurium,
Invivogen). At 24 hours, supernatants were collected for ELISA and cells collected for staining
of surface markers.
Flow Cytometry
Identiﬁcation of surface molecule expression by ﬂow cytometric analysis was conducted as pre-
viously described [29]. Brieﬂy, samples were blocked by incubating puriﬁed anti-CD16/ 32 (Fc
block, BD Biosciences) on ice for 15 minutes. Then, samples were stained with mouse specific
T-cell markers or DC markers antibody cocktails in staining buffer (1% BSA in 1XPBS) on ice
for 45—60mins. T-Cell marker cocktail: CD4-FITC, CD8-PE, CD28-PECy5, CD-ZS-PECy7, and
CTLA-4-APC. DC marker cocktail: HZKb-FITC, I-Ab-PE, CD86-PECy5, CD11c-PECy7, and
CD80-APC. Stained samples were ﬁxed with 4% paraformaldehyde on ice for 15 mins. Stained
and fixed samples were stored in 500pL of staining buffer. Samples were read on Gallios Flow
Cytometer (Beckman-Coulter). Analysis was conducted with Cyﬂogic.
Cytokine Analysis
Supernatants were analyzed by DuOSet (R&D Systems) according to manufacturer’s protocol
as previously described [29—31]. Supernatants were analyzed for inﬂammatory cytokines
(TNF-oc, IL-6) and lymphocyte cytokines (IL-2, IFN-y). Lower limits of detection for the assay
were between 16—32 pg/mL.
Statistics
Splenocytes were collected from 6 mice per group. Flow analysis counted 20,000 events per
sample. ELISA analysis was conducted in duplicate or triplicate. Data was analyzed by Two-
Way ANOVA followed by Bonferroni post-hoc test. Signiﬁcance is considered when p<0.05.

Splenocyte Population Changes between Flight Mice and Ground
Controls
Basic differentiation of splenocyte cell populations between ﬂight mice and matched ground
controls were completed by ﬂow cytometric analysis. Forward scatter (FS) and side scatter (SS)
parameters were noted, with the former measuring size of particle and the latter measuring
granularity. Cells were assessed immediately post 13 days in ﬂight, or following short term cul-
ture in vitro. Distinct Changes in total splenocyte population were noted. Native splenocytes
collected from spleens immediate upon sacriﬁce demonstrated two distinct cell populations,
based 011 F8. The ﬂight mice splenocytes selectively demonstrated presence of a third popula-
tion within gate 3 (G3) with higher FS compared to ground controls (Fig 1a). Fig 1b shows rep-
resentative dot plots of cell population makeup within each gate identiﬁed in Fig 1a. There are
Clear population differences in cells expressing CD4, CD8, MHC I and MHC 11 (Fig 1b). Exam-
ination of T-cell and antigen presentation cell markers on the different cell populations found
that G3 cells contained a higher percentage of CD4+ and CD8+ cells compared to G1 and G2
populations. The G3 population also had increased surface expression of MHC I compared to

G1 and G2 cells (Fig 1c). This indicates that post-spaceﬂight mice have spleens with slightly
higher CD4 and CD8 T-cell populations compared to matched ground controls.

Upon culture for 24 hours in cell media, relative marker expression for the splenocyte popu-
lation shifted. Cultured splenocytes isolated from ground control mice exhibited an increase in
cell density in G3 compared to cultured splenocytes isolated from ﬂight mice (Fig 2a). Exami-
nation revealed that G3 population has higher percentage of CD8+ and MHC 1+ cells. It was
also noted that G3 population also displayed increased surface expression of CD8+ as indicated
by increased mean ﬂuorescent intensity (MFI). Cell populations of G2 and G4 display surface
marker expression typical of dendritic cells and macrophages (Fig 2b and 2c). These data sug-
gests that in vitro culturing of splenocytes from ground control mice enhances relative abun-
dance of CD8 T-cell marker expression compared to splenocytes collected from the mice post-
spaceﬂight.

Splenocyte Markers Altered Post-Spaceflight
With obvious differences in cell population observed from splenocytes collected from ground
control versus ﬂight mice within hours post-spaceﬂight, detailed examination of surface mark-
er changes were conducted. In addition to changes in overall T-cell and dendritic cell popula-
tions, markers important for T-cell activation and proliferation and dendritic cell antigen
presentation were also examined (Tables 1 and 2).

Analysis of cell populations indicated that the majority of lymphocytes resided within the
G2 and G3 gated areas. As such, examination of changes in T-cell populations was restricted to
G2 and G3 events. T-cell markers of interest examined are CD4, CD8, CD28 (the second signal
for T-cell activation), CD25 (IL-2 receptor), and CTLA-4 (the signal for T-cell anergy). No dif-
ferences were observed in percent of splenocytes expressing these surface markers between
ﬂight and ground control mice. However, several signiﬁcant changes were observed in the

intensity of surface marker expression. Splenocytes from ﬂight mice had a signiﬁcant decrease
in CD4 MFI, with a concurrent increase in CD8 MFI, compared to ground controls. The inten-
sity of CD25 expression in both CD4 and CD8 cells were signiﬁcantly decreased in splenocytes
from ﬂight mice compared to ground controls (Table 1). Little to no CTLA-4 expression was
detected from any of the samples (data not shown).

Examination of antigen presentation and CO-stimulatory molecules were focused on events
occurring in cells gated within G1, G2, and G3. There was a signiﬁcant increase in population
of splenocytes expressing the dendritic cell marker (CD1 1C) from ﬂight mice compared to
ground controls. A similar increase was also observed in dendritic cells (CD11C+) expressing
MHC 1. However, a signiﬁcant decrease was detected in dendritic cells co-expressing MHC II
from splenocytes isolated from ﬂight mice compared to ground controls (Table 2).
Post-Spaceflight Splenocytes Increased Ability to Uptake Particles
A central process in innate immunity is the ability to phagocytose. To examine if post-space-
ﬂight conditions affected the ability of splenocytes t0 uptake particles, splenocytes were incu-
bated with ﬂuorescent beads, and analyzed for head ingestion conducted by ﬂow cytometry.

Three distinct populations for positive bead uptake were detected, and labeled as low, medi-
um, high according to ﬂorescent intensity (F1). Cells from G1, G2, and G3 were considered as

Changes in T-Cell Surface Molecules upon Stimulation
Next, changes in T-cells surface marker expression post stimulation with anti-CD3/CD28 anti-

signiﬁcantly decreased in splenocytes collected from ﬂight mice in all cultured conditions
(media control, CD3/ 28, or ConA) compared to ground controls. Additionally, stimulation of
cultured cells also caused a downward trend of CD4 expressing cells compared to culturing in
media control (Fig 421). There was no signiﬁcant difference in cell population expressing both
CD4 and CD28 (Fig 4b). Stimulation with ConA dramatically increased the CD4+CD25+ pop-
ulation, with a signiﬁcant decrease observed in splenocytes from ﬂight mice compared to
ground controls (Fig 4c). A similar increase in CD4 cell population co-expressing CD28 and

splenocytes from ﬂight mice demonstrated and increase in CD28/ 25 co-expressing cells com-
pared to ground controls (Fig 4d).

Previous observations in our laboratory demonstrated that the action of in vitro culturing
leads to altered cell population (non-published observation). For example, simple in vitro cul-
turing 0f splenocytes in media alters intensity of CD8 expression. This was now examined in
the post-ﬂight group. After 24 hours in cell media, splenocytes, from both ﬂight and ground
controls, developed two distinct CD8+ cell populations based on mean ﬂuorescent intensity
(MFI). The populations were termed CD810+ and CD8hi+. Upon stimulation with ConA for 24
hours, this distinction disappears and most of the CD8+ splenocytes are CD810+ (Fig 5).

Examination of CD8 expression during stimulation is divided between CD810 and CD8hi
populations. There is little if any change in CD8 expression among the media control and
CD3/28 and Con A stimulated groups. However, CD8hi expression is very low after stimula-
tion with ConA. No signiﬁcant differences between splenocytes isolated from ﬂight mice or
ground controls in all culture conditions. The exception is the observation of a signiﬁcant in-
crease in CD25+CD28+ expression of CD8+ T-cells from splenocytes of ﬂight mice compared
to ground controls (Fig 6).

Presentation and Activation Molecule Changes in Splenocytes during
TLR Stimulation
Effective immunity against pathogens relies on innate recognition of molecular patterns and
activation of antigen presentation. Toll-like receptors (TLR) are well characterized pattern rec-
ognition receptors that initiate activation of the innate response. Using agonists for TLR-Z (Zy-
mosan), TLR-4 (LPS), and TLR-5 (ﬂagellin), splenocytes were stimulated for 24 hours and
analyzed for surface expression of antigen presentation and co-stimulatory molecules.

Surface expression of MHC I from ﬂight mice or ground controls demonstrated two distinct
populations. One population exhibited low intensity of MHC I expression that is well conﬁned
to G3. The other population had a diverse intensity range of MHC I expression that was gener-
ally higher compared to those in G2 (Fig 7a). Analysis of MHC I allowed grouping into MHC
I10 (G3) and MHC Ihl (G2) populations. In percent population analysis of MHC I expression,
no differences were observed for any of the TLR agonist conditions between splenocytes isolat-
ed from ﬂight mice or ground controls. Interestingly, there was an across the board decrease of
MHC I MFI from splenocytes isolated from ﬂight mice compared to ground controls in the G2
(MHC Ihl) population. This trend was completely reversed in the G3 (MHC 110) population in
MHC I MFI, with splenocytes from ﬂight mice demonstrating a signiﬁcant increase in expres-
sion intensity compared to ground controls (Fig 7b). No differences were observed in expres-
sion of MHC II between ﬂight mice and ground controls (data not shown).

Expression of CD1 1c, a mouse dendritic cell marker, showed that splenocytes from ﬂight
mice had a global decrease in expression of CD1 1c positive cells under all culture conditions
(Fig 8a). These dendritic cell populations were investigated for expression of antigen presenta-
tion and co-stimulatory molecules. CD1 lC+MCHl+ cells were decreased in both percent popu-
lation and intensity of MHC I expression in all culture conditions in ﬂight mice splenocytes
compared to ground controls (Fig 8b). CD11C+MHCII+ splenocytes from ﬂight mice demon-
strated increased in percent population and intensity of MHC II expression compared to
ground controls (Fig 8c). There was little difference between ﬂight mice and ground controls in
CD1 lC+CD86+ splenocytes, except a signiﬁcant decrease in CD1 lC+CD86+ cells under TLR-5
stimulation (Fig 8d). Finally, there was very low overall expression of CD80 (data not shown).

Cytokine Production from Stimulated Splenocytes Post-Spaceflight
The Changes in surface expression of T-cell activation molecules, as well as dendritic cell anti-
gen presentation and CO-stimulatory molecules, during stimulation indicated potential func-
tional dysregulation caused by spaceﬂight. Cytokine production during stimulation is often
used to determine cell activity. Supernatants from splenocytes stimulated with T-cell stimu-
lants 0r TLR agonists were further examined for cytokine production by ELISA.

Stimulation with ConA demonstrated a non-signiﬁcant trend of increased IFN-y produc-
tion and a concurrent decrease in IL-2 production from ﬂight mice splenocytes compared to
ground controls (Table 3). TLR-2 and TLR-4 agonists also stimulated an increase in produc-
tion of TNF-oc and IL-6 from splenocytes isolated from ﬂight mice versus ground controls.
Only the increase in TNF-oc induced by TLR-2 agonist represented a signiﬁcant difference
(Table 4). Little (below the level of detection of the assay) to no TNF-oc and IL-6 were produced
when stimulated with TLR-5 agonist (data not shown).

Discussion

The immune dysfunction post-spaceﬂight is well documented. This disruption in immune ac-
tivity is believed to be partly responsible for observed spaceﬂight and post-ﬂight related inci-
dence of immune-related adverse health events that may occur during spaceﬂight. With future
plans for longer duration space travel, the question of how Changes in host immunity would af-
fect overall crew health needs to be addressed. The experiments conducted in this report f0-
Cused on Changes that bridge innate and adaptive immune responses. This bridge is crucial to
generating long-term memory protection against infection, and critical for mounting immune
responses during reinfection and reactivation post ﬂight. Specifically, this report investigated
the ability of dendritic cells (DC) to respond to stimulation through TLRs, and T-cell respon-
siveness through the T-cell receptor.

To determine baseline receptor expression, the splenocytes were stained upon landing.
These native expressions found no differences observed in the percent population Changes of

CD4 or CD8 T cells, with results reﬂecting similar findings from published works showing no
Changes in percent population of CD4 or CD8 T cells in rodents post-spaceﬂight [32—34].
Other reports show mixed Changes. Speciﬁcally, some have identiﬁed increases in CD4 and
CD8 populations [35—38], others show decreased CD4 and CD8 populations [39, 40], and oth-
ers have shown a combination thereof [10] post-ﬂight. Pecaut, et al. demonstrated that there
was indeed a shift in leukocyte phenotypes to different organs, which may affect localization of
response [41]. Likewise, conﬂicting reports are found from peripheral blood of astronauts
post-ﬂight [15, 16, 18, 20]. Some of these differences were attributed to the type of lymph
organ examined, as thymus cells usually shows no Change in CD4 and CD8 T cells populations
while splenocytes do eXhibit differences between ﬂight animals and ground controls [36]. The
seemingly contradictory evidence could be explained by different gating strategies used to de-
termine percent positivity of events. The study presented here showed that splenocytes from
mice post-ﬂight demonstrated an increase in a cell population with high percentages of CD4+
and CD8+ cells.

While previous reports only examined percent positive populations, this study included eX-
amination of marker intensity, which was interpreted to indicate an increase in marker expres-
sion per cell. There was a signiﬁcant decrease in the intensity of CD4 and an increase in
intensity of CD8 expression on a per cell basis. Since CD4 and CD8 molecules play a role dur-
ing T-cell recognition of antigen presentation by binding to the antigen presentation molecules,
MHC I, MHC II, or CD1, any change in their surface expression could affect the avidity poten-
tial to alter T-cell stimulation. Indeed, the avidity/affinity model of peripheral T-cell regulation
suggests that Changes in CD4 and CD8 expression affect T-cell activation. CD810 cells require
higher avidity of T-cell receptor and MHC I interactions for activation [42] and control/sup-
press other CD8 T-cell responsiveness to antigen [43].

This study also found splenocytes from ﬂight mice had a signiﬁcant decrease in intensity of
CD25 expression on CD4+ and CD8+ T-Cells compared to ground controls. CD25 is the IL-2
receptor, which is often used as a marker to denote regulatory T-Cells. However, this decrease
in CD25 intensity is not interpreted to indicate a Change in regulatory T-Cell post-ﬂight, espe-
cially because the population of CD25+ splenocytes did not Change. The CD25 ligand, IL-2, is
the T-cell proliferating factor. Experiments on the Iurkat T cell line post-ﬂight demonstrated a
lack of proliferation and elevations of Fas/APO-l, suggesting spaceﬂight conditions induced
apoptosis in T-Cells [44, 45]. The decrease in CD25 expression on a per cell basis suggests that
ﬂight splenocytes downregulate factors for proliferation. And it has been clearly demonstrated
that immediate early genes of lymphocytes are affected under conditions of microgravity [46].

Dendritic cells are the primary antigen presenting cells to bridge innate and adaptive immu-
nity. DCs respond to invading pathogens, prime and activate antigen speciﬁc T-cells, and pro-
mote development of antigen specific memory. In the mouse, expression of CD11C, a [32
integrin, is a marker for DC identiﬁcation. Splenocytes from ﬂight mice demonstrated a signiﬁ-
cant increase in CD11C+ population compared to ground controls, suggesting an enhancement
of the DC population. This is the first reported Change of spaceﬂight on DC population dynam-
ics. Interestingly, previous published reports examining another [32 integrin, CD11b, showed a
decrease population Change, interpreted as a decrease in monocytes/macrophages [40], which
was also observed using CD14/ 16 markers for identification [10]. As with T-Cells, spaceﬂight
conditions were also reported to increased monocyte/macrophage population [15, 16]. Similar
to T-cell subsets, macrophages and dendritic cells populations have differential proliferation
results in response to spaceﬂight.

Examination of MHC I and II presentation molecule expression found that CD11C+ spleno-
Cytes post-ﬂight had a significant increase in MHC 1+ and a significant decrease in MHC II+
populations compared to ground controls. There are limited reports on antigen presentation

molecule expression, and both published articles also found a decrease in Class II presentation
molecules expressing populations [47, 48]. These results conﬁrm that spaceﬂight alters Class II
presentation molecule expression, Which may indicate a diminution in the potential to effec-
tively present antigens to CD4+ T-Cells.

Splenocytes post-spaceﬂight demonstrated an increase in bead uptake compared to ground
controls. This is the ﬁrst report that ﬂight conditions inﬂuence particle uptake. The implica-
tions suggest that spaceﬂight does not hinder particle uptake, and may even enhance the func-
tion. However, it is not Clear how alteration of particulate uptake would affect host immune
status. Limited hindlimb suspension model studies may shed light on this, if one takes the as-
sumption that uptake of pathogenic organisms are similar to that of beads. In those studies, in
viva infection found no Change in Clearance of rotaVirus [49] and a decrease in bacterial Clear-
ance of Pseudomonas aeruginosa [50] and Klebsiella pneumoniae [51]. This suggests that other
immune effects resulting from spaceﬂight contribute to Clearance dysfunction, even if there are
increased uptake events of particulates. Overall, this is difficult to assess, and we realize that
beads travel along different phagocytic pathways than the agents mentioned.

Development of effective immunity towards pathogens relies on responding to innate sig-
nals. The toll-like receptors (TLR) are well established pattern recognition receptors stimulated
by pathogenic motifs [52]. The most commonly used TLR ligand to investigate spaceﬂight ef-
fect on cell function is lipopolysaccharide (LPS). In humans, blood cells isolated during space-
ﬂight responded to LPS by increasing production of IL-8, however, this ﬁnding resolved upon
post-spaceﬂight examination [18]. LPS has also shown to promote lower production of IL-6,
TNF-oc, and IL- 10 and increased IL-1B post-spaceﬂight in humans [47]. Reports in mice show
a mixed response When looking a Whole splenocyte populations [53]. Puriﬁed macrophages
ﬂow in space demonstrated an increase in both IL-1 and TNF-oc production in response to LPS
[54]. While that report did not observe a signiﬁcant increase in inﬂammatory cytokines upon
LPS stimulation, the ﬂight splenocytes did eXhibit a trend of increase in TNF-oc and IL-6 pro-
duction compared to ground controls. The data presented here extended observations to in-
clude cytokine production With the TLR-2/ 6 and TLR-5 ligands, zymosan (fungal) and ﬂagellin
(bacterial) respectively. Zymosan stimulated a significant increase in TNF-oc; no cytokine
Changes were observed upon ﬂagellin stimulation. Chapes et a1. investigated stimulation With
poly IzC, a TLR-3 ligand, and found an increase in IFN-oc [54]. For the most part, ﬂight expo-
sure did not have a deleterious effect on TLR activation and stimulation, suggesting that the in-
nate immune inﬂammatory response remains intact.

Few published articles have examined Changes in surface expression of presentation and co-
stimulatory molecules after TLR stimulation. While cytokine production is an important indi-
cator of immune response, the main effect of how DCs response to TLR stimulation is to in-
crease antigen presentation and stimulate T-Cells [55]. Splenocytes demonstrated similar
Changes DC surface molecule expression post ﬂight, regardless of TLR stimulation. For exam-
ple, the DC population from the ﬂight mice had altered MHC I and MHC II expressing popula-
tions compared to ground controls, even in cultures that did not receive TLR-
agonist stimulation.

Regarding adaptive immune functions, T-Cells are critical for control of re-infection and re-
activation events. Unlike DCs, the effect post-spaceﬂight on T-Cell activity has been well docu-
mented. Stimulating With anti-CD3/CD28, Which simulates T-cell activation by antigen pre-
senting cells, resulted in increased IFN-y and decreased IL-2 [18, 56]. ConA stimulation, Which
stimulates T-Cells through the T-cell receptor Without requiring the secondary signal (CD28),
resulted in no Change or increased IL-2 [36, 57], increased IL-3, and decreased IFN-y [58]. Use
of other mitogens, such as PHA or PMA/Ionomycin, that stimulates by bypassing both the T-
cell and co-stimulatory receptors, led to no Change or decreased IL-2 [10, 57], decreased IFN-y

[10] and decreased TNF-oc [18]. The data in this report reﬂects some differences in reported
observations, although in line with that reported by Gridley, et al. [59]. Rather, the results re-
ported here for ConA stimulation demonstrated a non-signiﬁcant increase in IFN-y and de-
creased IL-2. The discrepancy in cytokine results could be differences in cell culture number,
concentration of stimulants, and time of stimulation.

Surface molecule expression was examined in stimulated T-Cells. Little or no differences
were observed in the ﬂight mice versus ground controls, with two notable exceptions. Regard-
less of stimulation parameters, the cultured splenocytes isolated from ﬂight mice were signiﬁ-
cantly depressed in their expression of CD4. Second, while expression of CD8 intensity
immediately post-spaceﬂight demonstrated an increase on a per cell basis, further in vitro cul-
ture of cells distinctively identified two sets of CD8 cells, CD810 and CD8hi. This distinction dis-
appeared upon ConA stimulation. Indeed, the ﬂight mice splenocytes evidenced a signiﬁcant
increase in CD4 or CD8 T-Cells that also expressed CD25 or CD25/ 28. Therefore, it is impor-
tant for future studies to deﬁne gating strategies, as we have done here. We suggest that CD25,
along with CD69, are used as markers of early T-Cell activation. Short-term spaceﬂight in-
creased expression of CD25/ 69 when stimulated with anti-CD3/28 [20]. The results with ConA
may indicate that ﬂight mice could demonstrate increased early T-cell activation upon stimula-
tion, compared to ground controls.

Our report focused on phenotypic alterations that bridge innate and adaptive immune re-
sponses crucial for generating protective immune responses during reinfection and reactivation
post ﬂight. It would indeed be important to understand how long the phenotypic Changes were
sustained post ﬂight; analysis of genetic alterations or Changes in methylation status would cer-
tainly be warranted. The condition of the spaceﬂight environment has been shown to alter cy-
tosine methylation patterns to generate heritable epigenetic Changes in rice. Both hypo- and
hypermethylation events can occur, with concurrent dysregulation of gene expression. Genes
for DNA methyltransferases were very sensitive to spaceﬂight conditions [60, 61]. Similar ef-
fects were identified in microgravity studies in human lymphocytes [62, 63], where both DNA
methylation genes, as well as histone acetylation genes, were affected. In addition, DNA repair
mechanisms were also diminished. Overall this suggests both an accumulation of damaged
DNA as well as the potential for inheritable and sustainable Changes in cellular
phenotypic activity.

In conclusion, there eXists a large body of evidence that spaceﬂight does impact T-cell activity
and cause global suppression in response to multiple stimulants. Indeed, these “type IV hyper-
sensitive” Class responses have been found to be reduced to a variety of antigens during and post
spaceﬂight [14, 64]. The data from this study shed additional light towards molecular mecha-
nisms involved in immune Changes induced by spaceﬂight that could alter activation of innate
and adaptive immunity, at least post ﬂight. It remains to be determined if these changes may also
impact responses during active ﬂight. Given the limited number of subjects for spaceﬂight stud-
ies, future analysis should continue to examine both innate (DC) and adaptive (T-Cell) responses.
