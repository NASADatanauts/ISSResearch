microgravity increased by, on average, 30,1% in most donors.

But in three donors TNF-a secretion decreased by, on average,
22,8 % compared to onvground control medium samples. The
levels of other inﬂammatory cytokines produced by T- and B-
lymphocytcs (lela, 1L'6) dropped by 32,4% and 7% respec-
tively in microgravity. IL—4 and lL-2 were detected neither in 34,
Space samples nor in ground controls samples. It should be
emphasized that the cytokinc proﬁle was speciﬁc for lympho~
cytcs of a particular donor and the level of TNF~a , [La la, IL~6 .
in the medium after co~cultivation varied widely (data not
shown).
Conclusion
Human NK-cclls could recognize and interact with target cells
(K662) in suspension during 24 hs incubation in microgravity.
Human NK—cclls could exert in vitro the cytotoxic effects
against highly sensitive target cells in pg environment. The dif~
fcrcnccs of space: ﬂight eﬁ‘ccts on NK cytotoxicity in vitro
depended on donor‘s particular features. Therefore, according
to these results we could suggest that microgravity did not
inhibit NK—lymphocytc function and lymphocyte cytokinc pro-
duction in vitro. Moreover, NK-activity could be stimulated
during their interaction with target cells in microgravity.
