Abstract. Shape memory epoxy foams are a new class of materials for aerospace applications as
light actuators, structural parts with reduced size during transport, and expandable/deployable
structures. They were tested in an experiment onboard of the International Space Station in May
2011 (Shuttle Mission STS 134) and in April 2013, on board the BION—Ml capsule through the
Soyuz-2 launch vehicle, with the aim to study the behaVior in microgravity for future applications.
The experiments were performed by an autonomous device which was in turn composed of control
and heating system, battery pack and data acquisition system.
Micro-graVity does not affect the ability of the foams to recover their shape but it poses limits for
the heating system design because of the difference in heat transfer on earth and on orbit. This could
be very signiﬁcant for the behaviour of complex multi-functional structures in which shape memory
epoxy foams are integrated.
In this work, the main results of the experiments in microgravity are discussed and some results of
tests on ground are shown in order to evaluate new possible developments in the ﬁeld.
Introduction
Shape memory polymers (SMPs) are a very attractive class of materials because they are stimuli-
responsive materials. In fact, they have the capability of changing their shape upon application of an
external stimulus. The stimulus is mostly heat, but light, electric and magnetic ﬁelds may also be
used. For the heat-activated SMPs, the shape memory effect can be observed by performing a
typical thermo-mechanical cycle [1]. First, the polymer is processed to receive its permanent shape.
Then, it is heated and deformed in a new conﬁguration that can be stored by cooling. Heating up the
SMPs above a transition temperature (which is the glass transition temperature, Tg, for the
thermoset polymers) it recovers its original shape. This concept has been also applied to open
cellular (foam) structures [2-4]: the presence of pores can magnify shape memory effects also in
polymers with low memory properties. Moreover, in this case the material can be packed in a very
small volume because of pore collapsing, without generating any foam damage [5].
The common methods for producing polymer foams require the polymer to be processed at the
liquid state, while a new foaming process for thermosetting resin, called solid-state foaming, was
proposed in [6]. This process is able to produce high performance foams starting from a
thermosetting powder without any addition of blowing agents; it is low cost and time effective. The
obtained foams exhibit high shape memory properties and are very interesting for space application
[7-8]. In order to evaluate the behaviour of this new class of materials, a ﬁrst experiment was
designed [7] and performed in microgravity onboard the 188 in May 2011 [9-10]. A second
experiment was performed on board the BION—Ml capsule through the Soyuz-2 launch vehicle in
April 2013. It was found that microgravity does not affect the shape recovering because recovery
loads are so high to be practically insensitive to gravity. The main problem deals with the behaviour
of complex multi-functional structures in which shape memory epoxy foams are integrated. In this
case, the heat transfer is rather complex because the foam samples are not thermal conductor and
microgravity may indirectly inﬂuence the recovery. In this work, the main results of the
experiments in microgravity are discussed and results of tests on ground are shown in order to
evaluate new possible developments.

Materials and methods

Materials. A commercial epoxy resin (3M ScotchkoteTM 206 N), available as an uncured green
powder, was used for the foam fabrication. It is a one-part, heat-curable, thermosetting epoxy
coating. From previous studies, it was measured a density of the resin about 1.44 g/cm3 [6].

Foam samples preparation. Samples were fabricated by pouring 4g of powder in a cylindrical
stainless steel mold, 20 mm in diameter, and compacting the powder in tables. The compaction was
performed by using a universal testing machine (MTS Alliance RT/SO), the compaction rate was 10
mm min-l, the maximum packing pressure was 130 MPa and the holding time of 1 min. The tablets
were foamed by means of the insertion into a mufﬂe at 3200C for 8 min. Both the foaming process
and cooling were performed in air. More tables were foamed together, side by side (series
conﬁguration), horizontal foaming, to obtain foam samples of higher size as reported in [8]. The
ﬁnal epoxy foam density was about 0.36 g/cm3. More details on this process, called solid-state
foaming, were reported in [6, 8]. Finally, samples were cut from the foams with the desired shape
for the experiment in microgravity and for laboratory tests. Fig. 1 shows some samples for the
laboratory tests.

Laboratory tests. Constrained stress recovery tests were performed to evaluate some aspects of
the shape memory and to characterize the foam for future applications, mainly as actuators. Two
kind of specimens (diameter (|)=20 mm, height h=40 mm and h=52 mm) were heated to 1300C and
compressed to a strain of 50% and 62% respectively. Fig. 2 shows the aspect of the specimen with a
reduction of 62% before and after the memory step. Each packaged specimen was then placed onto
the lower compression platen of the universal testing machine and compressed at room temperature
to a preload 0f 1 N. The platen was then held at that position as the polymer was heated from 300C
over the Tg and cooled from this temperature to 300C, with a not constant heating rate depending on
the heating system (a hot gun). Temperature values were acquired on the sample surface by means
of a thermocouple. Fig. 3 shows the experimental set-up.

Experiments in microgravity
Brief description.

Two experiment were performed in microgravity: onboard 0f the International Space Station in
May 2011 (I-Foam, Shuttle Mission STS 134), and on board the BION-Ml capsule through the
Soyuz-2 launch vehicle (Ribes_Foam2) in April 2013. The on-orbit experiments consisted in the
heating of three samples having different shapes (screw, thin sheet and parallelepiped in the ﬁrst
experiment, and a prototype of actuator, a sheet of composite laminate and parallelepiped in the
second one), packed on ground, to evaluate the shape recovery capabilities in the space
environment. Temperature data logs and Video cameras were used to measure the foam recovery as
a function of time. The evolution of the foam during the recovery was monitored and analyzed for I-
FOAM experiment in [9- 10] .

The equipment of the Payloads, developed by Kayser Italia, was in the Biokon Container that is
composed of a top case and a lower volume. The top case contains the front panel and the battery
pack. The lower volume contains the control unit including the heating system, a camera and the
experiment unit with its data acquisition system. The payload is autonomous, n0 electrical
connection is needed. In Fig. 4 the images of the samples integration in the experiment unit is
shown for the two 011 orbit experiments. The strategies for the development of the samples were
discussed in [7, 10].

Main results.
In the development of actuators and expandable/deployable structures, the I-Foam experiment had
to exploit different conﬁgurations taking into account severe size and temperature limitations [9-
10]. The maximum temperature was limited to a nominal value of 100 °C and a maximum
allowable value of 110 °C due to safety requirement. The maximum time for the experiment was
ﬁxed in 1 hr, including the initial heating time.
Material recovery started after 25 min when the heating plate temperature approached 110 °C. The
sample with torsion conﬁguration was able to rotate the screw which was ﬁxed at its end. The
sample with bending conﬁguration recovered a large part of the initial shape, but also detaches from
the heating plate and after losing this contact, its recovery gradually stopped. A comparison
between initial deformed shape and ﬁnal shape of the foam samples is reported in [9].
The ﬁnal recovery was only 10% for the sample in the compression conﬁguration, 72% for the
sample in the bending conﬁguration, and 71 % for the sample in the torsion conﬁguration (i.e. an
angular rotation of 128°). Therefore, apart from the compression conﬁguration which presented
problems for its heating [9], the same recovery percentage was achieved by the other two
conﬁgurations. On-ground laboratory experiments showed that 100% recovery can be reached just
by increasing the maximum temperature to 120 °C. Experimental tests on ground had also shown
that the way of ﬁxing the sample on the housing base and the way of sample deformation during the
recovery strongly inﬂuence the recovery itself, because of modiﬁcations in the heat transfer. This is
particularly evident when the maximum temperature is not so high (near the Tg) and the material is
not conductive. Other important aspects are material variability, sample standardization and
orientation, clamping conditions, distance of the samples from the housing vertical walls.
Thanks to these results, a new experiment in microgravity, Ribes_Foam2, has been carried out by
the same device: for the ﬁrst time a shape memory composite was recovered, and the actuation load
during time was measured during the recovery of an epoxy foam sample.
In this case the maximum temperature reached during the experiment was 111,7 °C, even if the set
temperature was 120°C. Unfortunately, the launch was delayed and the charge of the battery was
not sufﬁcient to heat as previously ﬁxed. The sample with compression conﬁguration recovered
almost his initial shape. In fact, the three optical sensors for detecting the shape recovery were
activated after about 34 min, 38 min, and 48 min respectively. The corresponding temperature of
the heating plate was 107°C, 109°C and 111°C. The sheet of composite laminate recovered his
shape and also in this case a detachment from the heating plate is evident.
Instead, Fig. 5 shows the prototype of actuator before and after the experiment in microgravity. It is
clearly evident the actuation. The spring stiffness is 2.1 N/mm and therefore it will be possible to
infer the value of the actuation load as a function of the time, analyzing the Video recorded on orbit.

Results of laboratory tests and discussion
The prototype of one-way actuator worked well on ground [10] and in microgravity, as above
discussed. A further step could be the development of a two-way actuators, but further studies are
necessary to better investigate the material behavior in terms of force exerted during heating in the
shape recovery step. The laboratory tests have investigated such aspect.
During the shape recovery tests, the temperature of the sample was acquired as a function of the
time (see ﬁg.6). Temperature measurement is affected by the platen and it is very difﬁcult
measuring the average temperature of the foam sample as well as its local value. The temperature
curve can only be used for the process control, not for estimating the material transition. Scattering
depends on the effect of the air gun Which was moved to make the temperature uniform. This
heating system is very simple and useful for preliminary tests.

Increasing the temperature, there is a change in the contact area, and only When the contact between
the platen and the sample is good the load increases. The maximum load is reached after 2 min and
it is constant for about 1 min. The maximum load value is 16.3 N. The total recovery is therefore
obtained. Subsequently, the load decreases because of the temperature effect.
In Fig. 8 the load as a function of the time for the sample #2 ((I)=20 mm, h=52 mm) is shown.

In this case, the initial contact was optimized by grinding the top and bottom surface of the sample
after deformation and for this reason the ﬁrst part of Fig. 7 is absent. After 2 min, the maximum
load is reached and the total recovery is achieved.
The maximum load value is 23.3 N. After 6 min the degradation occurs, and at 10 min the heating is
stopped and the freezing begins.

Fig. 9 Comparison of the results of Fig. 7 and 8.

In Fig. 9 the comparison of the results previously discussed is shown. The trend is about the
same for the two samples. These tests could be repeated With a different heating system that gives
uniform heating, but the expected behavior should be the same.

Finally, a great attention should be paid for the sample geometry. In particular, the diameter to
height ratio must be adequately high to avoid the buckling phenomenon during the memory and
recovery step. In ﬁg. 10 two examples of buckling are shown for the memory step and recovery
tests respectively.

These preliminary results are interesting for developing a prototype of two-way actuator. In fact,
the effect of the temperature on the elastic modulus can give a difference in the exerted forces also
on elements of the same material and geometry.

Fig. 10 Examples of buckling during the memory step (011 the left) and the constrained recovery
tests (011 the right).

The material gives the maximum load near the Tg for a short time, over this temperature the
material goes into a rubbery state and it can be easily deformed and packed. Therefore, the memory
step and the recovery test could be obtained on different sides of the actuator using different heating
programs.

Conclusion

The experiments I-FOAM and Ribes_F0am 2 were performed in space, and have shown the
ability of solid state epoxy foams and composites to recover their shape in microgravity. I-FOAM
has shown that miero-gravity poses limits for the heating system design because of the difference in
heat transfer on earth and 011 orbit. The Ribes_f0am2 experiment have taken into account this
difference by using ﬁlled materials (e.g. carbon ﬁber composites), by improving the contact of the
foam samples with the heated walls, and increasing the maximum temperature necessary to obtain
the full recovery of the samples. The present heating system is based on heat conduction as thermal
radiation is negligible at low temperatures, but other heating systems could be used, and solar
radiation could be very promising.

All of these aspects could become very signiﬁcant for the behaviour of complex multi-funetional
structures in which shape memory epoxy foams are integrated.

Finally, the results of laboratory tests have investigated further 011 the behavior of the epoxy foam
during heating for the shape recovery. These results could be useful for future developments. In
particular, they will be used for developing a prototype of two-way actuators.
