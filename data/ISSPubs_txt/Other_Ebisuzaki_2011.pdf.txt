(for the JEM-EUSO collaboration)
The JEM-EUSO mission explores the origin of the extreme energy cosmic rays (EECRs) above 100 EeV and explores the
limits of the ﬁandamental physics through the observations of their arrival directions and energies. It is designed to achieve an
exposure larger than 1 million km2 sr year to open a new particle astronomy channel. This super-Wide-ﬁeld (60 degrees)
telescope With a diameter of about 2.5 m looks down from space onto the night sky to detect near UV photons (330-400nm,
both ﬂuorescent and Cherenkov photons) emitted from the giant air showers produced by EECRs. The arrival direction map
With more than ﬁve hundred events Will tell us the origin of the EECRs and allow us to identify the nearest EECR sources With
known astronomical objects. It Will allow them to be examined in other astronomical channels. This is likely to lead to an
understanding of the acceleration mechanisms, perhaps producing discoveries in astrophysics and/or fundamental physics. The
comparison of the energy spectra among the spatially resolved individual sources Will help to clarify the acceleration/emission
mechanism, and also ﬁnally conﬁrm the Greisen-Zatsepin-Kuz'min process for the validation of Lorentz invariance up to

EUSO mission is planned to be launched by a H2B rocket about JFY 2015 -2016 and transferred to 188 by H2 Transfer Vehicle
