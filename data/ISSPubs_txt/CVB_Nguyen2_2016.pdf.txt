mulation near the heater end and surveillance images of the device, taken at the steady state, showed
that the bubble gets much closer to the heater end in the mixture case instead of being isolated from
the heater by a thick liquid pool as in the pure pentane case. The proximity of the bubble to the heater
wall led to more evaporation at the heater end in the mixture case, and therefore a higher heat transfer
coefﬁcient. The pressure proﬁle calculated from the Young—Laplace equation supports the observations
made from the surveillance images.
