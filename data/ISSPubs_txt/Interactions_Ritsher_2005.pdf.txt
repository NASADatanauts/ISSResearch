Abstract

Based on our previous studies of astronauts and cosmonauts, we hypothesized that the patterning of mood states
among International Space Station (188) crewmembers would vary by culture, regardless of the overall frequency of
these states in each cultural group. Russian clinicians recognize a pattern of distress known as asthenia. According to
the asthenia model, depression should covary with fatigue. According to the American model of psychological
distress, depression and fatigue are two separate syndromes and therefore would be less likely to covary within
individuals. Previously, we found support for this cultural difference in patterns of mood states in two datasets. Our
team’s new study of 188 personnel provided an opportunity to replicate these analyses again. Results show the
predicted cultural differences for crewmembers during ﬂight. These results are consistent with Russian space
psychologists’ concept of asthenization, which is believed to be an early indicator of stress among cosmonauts
during long-duration space missions. However, American astronauts manifest distress differently. It is important to
use culturally appropriate assessment strategies in order to detect stress reactions accurately while they are still mild,
because they have the potential to seriously disrupt future international space missions, such as a ﬂight to Mars.
