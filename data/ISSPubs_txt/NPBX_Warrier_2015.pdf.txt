The results of the experiments show that at low superheats, bubbles generated on the heater surface
slide and merge to yield a large bubble located in the middle of the heater. At high superheats, the large
bubble may lift off from the heater but continue to hover near the surface. In both these scenarios, the
large bubble serves as a vapor sink. Natural convection heat transfer in microgravity was found to be con—
sistent with that predicted by available correlations. Steady state nucleate boiling and maximum heat
ﬂuxes are found to be lower than those obtained under earth normal gravity conditions. The heat transfer
coefﬁcients for nucleate pool boiling are found to be weakly dependent on the level of gravity (h/hge o< (g/
ge)1/8). Maximum heat ﬂux also shows a weaker dependence on gravity than that given by the hydrody—
namic theory of boiling. The data are useful for calibration of results of numerical simulations. Any cor—
relations that are developed for nucleate boiling heat transfer under microgravity condition must account
for the existence of vapor escape path (large vapor bubble acting as a sink) from the heater, relative size
of the large bubble and heater, and the size and geometry of the chamber used.

used in NPBX. The edge of the aluminum wafer (Fig. 1) was bent
to join with the housing holding the wafer. The wafer was 1 mm
thick and 89.5 mm in diameter. The ﬁve artiﬁcial cavities were
fabricated using the Electrical Discharge Machining (EDM) tech-
nique. Four of the cavities were located at the corners of a square
(38.18 mm per side), while the ﬁfth cavity was located at the
center. The center cavity is denoted as cavity 1, while the other
cavities are denoted as cavities 2, 3, 4 and 5, respectively (Fig. 1).
The diagonal distance between the center cavity and the other
cavities is 27.0 mm. Single bubble departure diameters predicted
at 10—4ge were used to determine the distance between the cav-
ities, since we were not sure what level of gravity would be
available on 155. The spacing was such that lateral merger of
bubbles nucleating at different sites would occur prior to depar-
ture, when multiple nucleation sites are activated on the heater
surface. The nominal dimensions of each of the cavities were:
diameter — 10 um and depth — 100 um. However some variations
in the cavity dimensions were observed due to the variability
inherent in the EDM process; cavity diameters varied from 16.3
to 17.6 um. Fig. 2 shows a photograph of one of the cavities
