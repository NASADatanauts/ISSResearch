Abstract—Recent advances in personal computer technology have led to the development of relatively
low-cost software to generate high-resolution three-dimensional images. The capability both to rotate
and zoom in on these images superposed on appropriate background images enables high-quality
movies to be created. These developments have been used to produce realistic simulations of the Inter-
national Space Station on CD-ROM. This product is described and its potentialities demonstrated.
With successive launches, the 188 is gradually built up, and visualised over a rotating Earth against the
star background. It is anticipated that this product’s capability Will be useful When training astronauts
to carry out EVAs around the ISS. Simulations inside the 188 are also very realistic. These should
prove invaluable When familiarising the ISS crew With their future workplace and home. Operating pro-
cedures can be taught and perfected. “What if” scenario models can be explored and this facility should
be useful When training the crew to deal With emergency situations which might arise. This CD-ROM
product Will also be used to make the general public more aware of, and hence enthusiastic about, the
International Space Station programme. (3) 1998 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved
