Abstract

Genome-wide transcriptional proﬁling experiments on the International Space Station (188) have revealed important

alterations in the gene expression of Drosophila. In contrast, simulated microgravity experiments in Earth-based laboratories,

where the particular constraints and conditions in orbiting spacecraft are absent, show weaker changes in gene expression.

Here we use the “gene expression dynamics inspector” (GEDI) self—organizing maps to investigate the effect of altered gravity

on different populations of Drosophila. We employ diamagnetic levitation and different mechanical techniques to generate

microgravity and hypergravity and compare the changes in gene expression in these modiﬁed environments. In addition to

behavioural and reproductive responses detected at the gene expression level, our results also indicate a subtle response of the

transcriptome that is ﬁnely—tuned to Earth ’s gravity.
