In the near-weightless environment of orbiting spacecraft capillary forces dominate interfacial ﬂow phenomena
over unearthly large length scales. In current experiments aboard the International Space Station, partially
open channels are being investigated to determine critical ﬂow rate-limiting conditions above Which the free
surface collapses ingesting bubbles. Without the natural passive phase separating qualities of buoyancy, such
ingested bubbles can in turn wreak havoc on the ﬂuid transport systems of spacecraft. The ﬂow channels under
investigation represent geometric families of conduits With applications to liquid propellant acquisition, thermal
ﬂuids circulation, and water processing for life support. Present and near future experiments focus on transient
phenomena and conduit asymmetries allowing capillary forces to replace the role of gravity to perform passive
phase separations. Terrestrial applications are noted where enhanced transport Via direct liquid-gas contact is
desired.
