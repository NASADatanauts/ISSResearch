Abstract
Macrotrachela quadricorm’fera, a bde110id rotifer, is the animal model of an experiment scheduled on the
International Space Station (ISS). The focus of the experiment is the role of the cytoskeleton during
oogenesis and early development. Bdelloids will ﬂy desiccated, be rehydrated 0n the ISS and cultivated for
ﬁve generations. We present the outline of the ISS experiment, the expectations and the state-of-the-art of
ground-based research run to date on the major topics of the planned experiment: anhydrobiosis and
embryogenesis. Anhydrobiosis focuses on two major aspects, storage conditions that enhance recovery rate
and comparison of the resistance between dormant and active rotifers to UV radiation and other enVi-
ronmental injuries. Embryogenesis has been approached at the morphological level under ground condi-
tions: developing embryos have been studied by light and confocal microscopes.
