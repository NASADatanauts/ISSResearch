Abstract: MicrograVity experiments burning cast PMMA cylindrical rods in axial ﬂow have been
conducted aboard the International Space Station in the Microgravity Science Glovebox (MSG) facility
using the Burning and Suppression of Solids (BASS) ﬂow duct, as part of the BASS-II experiment.
Twenty-four concurrent-ﬂow tests were performed, focusing on ﬁnding ﬂammability limits as a function
of oxygen and ﬂow speed. The oxygen was varied by using gaseous nitrogen to Vitiate the working
volume of the MSG. The speed of the ﬂow parallel to the rod was varied using a fan at the entrance to
the duct. Both blowoff and quenching limits were obtained at several oxygen concentrations. Each
experiment ignited the red at the initially hemispherical stagnation tip of the rod, and allowed the ﬂame
to develop and heat the red at a sufﬁcient ﬂow to sustain burning. For blowoff limit tests, the astronaut
quickly turned up the ﬂow to obtain extinction. Complementary 5.18-second Zero Gravity Facility drop
tests were conducted to compare blowoff limits in short and long duration microgravity. For quenching
tests, the ﬂow was incrementally turned down and the ﬂame allowed to stabilize at the new ﬂow condition
for at least the solid-phase response time before changing it again. Quenching was observed when the
ﬂow became sufﬁciently weak that the ﬂame could no longer provide adequate heat ﬂux to compensate
for the heat losses (conduction into the rod and radiation). A surface energy balance is presented that
shows the surface radiative loss exceeds the conductive loss into the rod near the limit. The ﬂammability
boundary is shown to represent a critical Damkohler number, expressed in terms of the reaction rate
divided by the stretch rate. For the blowoff branch, the boundary exhibits a linear dependence on oxygen
concentration and stretch rate, indicating that the temperature at blowoff must be fairly constant. For the
quenching branch, the dominance of the exponential nature of the Arrhenius kinetics reaction rate
indicates that the temperature is critical.

1. Introduction

NASA STD 6001 Test 1[1] is the major method used to evaluate ﬂammability of materials
intended for use in habitable environments of US. spacecraft. The method is an upward ﬂame
propagation test initiated in a stagnant normal gravity environment and using a well-defined i gniter
ﬂame at the bottom of a vertically mounted sample. A material passes this test if the vertical burn
length is less than 15.2 cm (6 inches) and there is no evidence of transfer of burning debris. The
material either passes or fails the test at a given atmosphere (oxygen concentration, pressure). This
test assumes that the 1 g upward ﬂame spread is conservative relative to the material’s ﬂammability in
space.

What is problematic with this approach is the assumption that the 1 g upward ﬂame spread test
is the worst case for ﬂammability. Recent research has shown that current normal gravity materials
ﬂammability results are not conservative when compared to ﬂammability in ventilated microgravity

or partial gravity conditions. Materials have sustained burning in microgravity at or below the
ﬂammability limits measured with the Test 1 protocol. What if materials are intrinsically more
ﬂammable in space than on earth, due to reduced convective cooling and yet adequate oxygen
ventilation?

As part of the Burning and Suppression —II (BASS-II) experiment, twenty-four concurrent
ﬂow ﬂammability tests with cast PMMA rods were performed in the Mierogravity Science Glovebox
(MSG) [2] in the Destiny Lab of the International Space Station (188). Twenty-two rods were clear,
and two were black, but no obvious differences between clear and black have been noted to date.

The obj eetive 0f the BASS-II concurrent rod tests was to obtain the lower portion of the concurrent
microgravity ﬂammability map as a function of ventilation ﬂow and ambient oxygen concentration.

Flame spread along rods with aXial ﬂow has been widely studied [3-13]. Most of the work
has been downward ﬂame spread, or opposed ﬂow ﬂame spread. Only a few studies have been
performed in reduced gravity. Tarifa and his colleagues [9] conducted parabolic and sounding rocket
opposed ﬂow ﬂame spread experiments with hollow rods and found that ﬂame extinction depends
considerably on both oxygen concentration and ﬂow velocity, and quenching occurs at low ﬂow
velocities that are on the order of diffusive velocities.

Concurrent ﬂame spread along rods was tested aboard the Mir Space Station in the Skorost
hardware [14]. The extruded PMMA, Delrin, and High Density Polyethylene rods all showed the
same tendency to melt beneath the ﬂame and form accumulating molten balls on the stagnation end
of the rod, with the ﬂame wrapped around the molten ball. At low ﬂows, the small ﬂame at the
stagnation tip of the rod propagated simply through rod regression (bulk burning) rather than through
a concurrent ﬂame spread along the rod.

Rod bulk burning Via tip regression is the likely near-limit ﬂame geometry for an axial
concurrent ﬂow along a rod in general, so we proposed to use it to study materials ﬂammability with
a simple aXisymmetrie geometry with minimal heat losses (surface radiation loss, conduction along
the rod axis, n0 holder losses). The heat loss can be varied by varying the diameter of the rod, which
effectively changes the surface energy balance term associated with in-depth conduction from the
surface.

2. Experimental Setup

The BASS-II hardware used for these tests is shown inside the MSG working volume in Figure 1.
The BASS-II hardware consists of a ﬂow duet, still camera, Video camera, external control box and
associated plumbing and mounting systems. The three primary variables included the working volume
oxygen concentration, the ﬂow velocity through the duct, and the PMMA rod diameter.

The black anodized 7.6 cm X 7.6 cm X 17 em rectangular ﬂow duet with rounded corners was
originally built to perform gas jet difﬁJsion ﬂame studies [15], and was modiﬁed to accommodate solid
samples for the BASS series of experiments. The ﬂow through the duct was generated using a small
fan at the upstream end of the duct. The voltage to the fan was varied to change the ﬂow through the
duct. In addition, up to two additional ﬂow restrietors could be used at the fan inlet to increase the
pressure drop and thus reduce the ﬂow through the duct to the desired value for the test point. The
ﬂow then passed through a honeycomb ﬂow straightener and an inlet screen to reduce swirl. An
omnidirectional spherical air velocity transducer (TSITM # 8475) was positioned between the
honeycomb and the screen, and was used to measure the steady-state ﬂow velocity through the duct.
The air velocity transducer probe had a response time of approximately one minute. The fan voltage

was calibrated with the air velocity transducer reading at the end of every operations day using that
day’s ﬂow restrictor conﬁgurati0n(s).

The test section was 17 cm long. Inside the test section was a nozzle for nitrogen ﬂow to Vitiate the
working volume, a moveable scale to provide a reference at the sample plane, and an OrielTM #71768
thermopile detector with a Calcium Fluoride window with a spectral range of 0.13 to 11 microns in the
downstream top back corner of the duct. The test section of the duct had two orthogonal windows, the
top one being replaced for BASS to provide a mounting rail system for the solid samples. The top
window was used by a NikonTM D300 12.3 megapixel digital color still camera with a 60 mm lens that
provided 4320 X 2968 pixel images. The duct eXit contained a perforated copper plate followed by a
brass screen to provide heat rejection and a cold surface for soot deposition. The ﬂow turned ninety
degrees to eXit the duct, which facilitated mixing of the hot combustion gases with the cool ambient
air.

The front window opened to provide access to the test section for sample and igniter change out.
A Panasonic color Video camera WV-CP654 (760 X 480 pixel array) with a turning mirror looked in
the front window. The Video camera had a built-in digital overlay that displayed the nitrogen ﬂow rate
(cm3/min), fan voltage (lOXV), hot wire anemometer reading (cm/s), and the radiometer signal. The
radiometer signal was not calibrated, but provided a measure of the ﬂame dynamics and steadiness.
The external control box had controls for the fan voltage level, nitrogen ﬂow level, enable switches for
the igniter and nitrogen, and a radiometer gain level setting.

Seventeen clear cast PMMA cylindrical rods of various diameters (11with 1/4”, 4 with 3/8”, and 2
with 1/2” diameters) were burned in a concurrent ﬂow direction. The samples were manually ignited
by the astronaut at the initially hemispherical stagnation tip with a KanthalTM A-1 29 gauge h0t-wire
igniter with a nominal hot wire resistance of 0.8-1 ohms, powered by approximately 3.5-3.8 amps.
Samples are burned within the duct and the combustion products eXit the duct and mix with the gas in
the work volume.

To evaluate the levels of combustion products produced during microgravity ﬁres, we used on-
board sensors to measure the 02 depletion and the completeness of combustion (C0, C02). The 02,
C02, and CO measurements required two portable, battery powered instruments in the working volume
during testing: CDM, and CSA-CP. The oxygen sensor is not recalibrated 0n orbit, so we also used

the Mass Constituents Analyzer data to determine the oxygen sensor offset 011 a daily basis. The
resolution of the CSA-CO was 0.1% 02. Oxygen concentrations in the MSG working volume were
varied during the testing from ambient 188 oxygen levels (~ 21% 02) down to ~14% 02 for very near-
limit ﬂames. The CO sensor is zero calibrated every 60 days, with a range of 0-1000 ppm and a
resolution of 1 ppm. The CO2 sensor was within its calibration window, and had a range of 0-5% and
a resolution of 0.1% by volume of C02. The sensor data provided initial and ﬁnal conditions for
repeated tests in a sealed working volume, and allowed us to determine when the working volume
needed to be purged.

To obtain the desired Vitiated atmosphere, the MSG working volume was diluted using 188 nitrogen
(hose connecting BASS-II duct to back wall of MSG in Figure 1). The nitrogen was regulated with a
small (< 0.5 LPM) MKSTM 179A mass ﬂow meter and entered the ﬂow duet through a small nozzle
just downstream of the fan in the test section. The fan in the ﬂow duct was turned to maximum (> 100
LPM) during the nitrogen ﬂow to miX and blow the gas into the working volume and circulate it
continuously throughout the hours-long Vitiation. We developed a Vitiation model [16] based on a
Continuously Stirred Tank Reactor (CSTR) model. This perfect mixing approximation is valid as long
as the residence time (V/r = 500 min) is 5 to 10 times as long as the mixing time, which is easily the
ease for the 100 LPM mixing rate (250 L/ 100 LPM = 2.5 min mixing time). The model was veriﬁed
using intermittent on-board oxygen sensor readings during an initial Vitiation. This model was then
used to determine the nitrogen ﬂow rate and ﬂow time to achieve the desired oxygen concentration of
the test based upon the initial oxygen concentration reading and operational crew time constraints.

3. Results and Discussion

To start each experiment, the astronaut ignited the red at the stagnation tip and allowed the ﬂame
to develop and heat the rod axially at a sufﬁcient ﬂow to sustain burning. The time needed to
adequately develop the solid-phase thermal proﬁle is estimated to be when the Fourier number is
approximately equal to 0.3 (F0: Ott/R2~0.3) [17]. For a thermal diffusivity ofPMMA=1.2X10‘3
em2/s, the times range from 25 s to 100 s for the different rod radii tested.

3.1 Quenching Extinction

For quenching tests, the ﬂow was incrementally turned down and the ﬂame allowed to stabilize at
the new ﬂow condition for at least the solid-phase response time before changing it again.

Quenching was observed when the levels of forced ﬂow and/or oxygen concentration became
sufﬁciently weak that the ﬂame could no longer provide adequate heat ﬂux to compensate for the
heat losses (conduction into the rod and radiation). Quench test bums lasted up to 28 minutes. Near
—quenehing ﬂames for each rod size are shown in Figure 2.

1/8” (0.318 cm), 3/ 16” (0.476 cm), and W’ (0.635 cm). Flow and oxygen are not the same, but each
represents the lowest oxygen test for that red size.

3.1 Blowoff extinction

For blowoff limit tests, the astronaut quickly turned up the ﬂow to obtain extinction. The ﬂow at
blowoff was deﬁned by the fan voltage reading at the moment the stagnation region opened up and
the ﬂame moved downstream. The annular ﬂame would oscillate upstream and downstream multiple
times before completely blowing off. Later in the test program, we attempted to re-establish the
stagnation region after local blowoff by quickly reducing the ﬂow to a value below the blowoff
velocity, but we were only successful in one instance where the blowoff of the stagnation region may
not have been complete (ﬂame opening less than a thermal length, perhaps) due to the astronaut’s
quick response time. A subsequent attempt shortly after this was not able to re-establish the
stagnation region, so it seems that once the ﬂame is blown downstream of the stagnation region, the
ﬂame is unable to propagate upstream for the low oxygen levels tested (16.1% 02 and lower). This is
consistent with tests for opposed ﬂow ﬂame spread rods that were also done as part of BASS-II [18],
where ﬂame spread was not observed below 16.4 % 02. Example blowoff images are shown in
Figure 3.

3.2 Drop Tower tests

Complementary 5.18-seoond Zero Gravity Facility drop tests were conducted to compare blowoff
limits in short and long duration microgravity, using the microgravity wind tunnel drop rig [19]. For
the drop tests, the rod was ignited in normal gravity and allowed to burn and preheat the rod brieﬂy at
a ﬂammable oxygen ﬂow, and then the gas was switched to the test atmosphere and the package
released based on the ﬂow time of the gas to reach the ﬂame zone. The ﬂames in the drop tower
blowoff tests are signiﬁcantly smaller than the ISS ﬂames, as can be seen in Figure 3. This is most
likely due to the short burn time prior to blowoff, so the rod was not signiﬁcantly preheated.

and W’ (0.635 cm). Center image is of a 5.18-seoond Zero Gravity Research Center drop test, where
the ﬂame blew off during the drop, since no 188 blowoff tests were obtained with the intermediate
rod size. A green LED illuminates the drop test rod. Flow and oxygen are not the same, but each
represents the lowest oxygen test for that rod size.

3.4 Flammability Boundary

For each test, the ﬂow at which the ﬂames extinguished and the last ﬂow where a stable ﬂame
was observed (or where the ﬂame did not blowout in the drop time for drop tests), along with the
post-bum oxygen reading were used to generate the ﬂammability boundary, shown in Figure 4.
There appears to be a different 02 minimum for the 0.476 cm and 0.635 cm radius rods, which is
attributed to increased solid conductive heat loss for the larger red cross sectional area.

The thick gray ﬂammability boundary is the border between stable ﬂames and extinguished
ﬂames. It is a stochastic region due to the fact that near the ﬂammability boundary, the ﬂame is
sensitive to perturbations, and a random perturbation of sufﬁcient magnitude will extinguish a ﬂame
in this near-limit region [20]. The gray stochastic boundary is deﬁned by the combined equations
shown by the red and black dashed lines. These dashed lines are based on a critical Damkohler
number analysis, where a critical Damkohler number (Dam) is deﬁned as

Complementary drop tower test results are also shown. Extinction points (X’s) are eolor-eoded to
indicate rod diameter.

Notice that the black dashed line blowoff boundary in Figure 4 is linear (YOX ~ a), which would
seem to indicate that the dominant parameters for blowoff are these parameters in the Dacrit equation.
This implies that the fuel concentration and the critical temperature are fairly constant in the ﬂame
zone at blowoff where the reactants move so quickly through the reaction zone that they do not have

time to react. The critical temperature for ignition is a well-known concept that can be applied to
blowoff if one considers the ﬁJel and oxidizer to be in a state of continual ignition in the ﬂame zone.
Once the temperature in the ﬂame zone drops below the critical temperature for ignition, the ﬂame
blows off.

The drop tower blowoff data linear curve ﬁt is plotted for comparison, and agrees very well with
the 188 data. This further implies that the different levels of preheating of the rod do not affect
blowoff extinction. The linear blowoff boundary has interesting implications in that it may be
possible to linearly extrapolate blowoff data down to zero stretch rate and use that oxygen value as a
conservative estimate of the minimum oxygen concentration where the material will burn. This will
allow us to de-rate materials based on normal gravity ﬂammability tests to ensure the material will
not burn in space. Using the y-interoept of the linear ﬁt (13.3 % 02 in the Figure 4 ﬁt, versus the
minimum test point of 13.6 % 02) would add a slight level of conservatism.

On the other hand, the quenching branch is captured with a red dashed exponential ﬁt. This
suggests the Arrhenius temperature exponential term is dominant in the quenching region. This is
expected at quenching, where the temperature drops off dramatically while ﬂow time is plentiful.
Heat losses dominate to cool the ﬂame to extinction, as was modeled by [20, 21]. This boundary is
very steep when plotted on a linear X aXis as shown in Figure 4. To get the “U”-shaped ﬂammability
boundary, a logarithmic X aXis is often used, which expands the quenching branch while making the
linear blowoff branch have a curved shape.

We recognize that the appropriate ﬂow parameter to use to compare data for the different rod
sizes is the ﬂame stretch, which is defined here as sum of the combined ﬂow-induoed stretch and the
ourvature-induoed stretch, or a=af+ awry. The effect of ourvature-induoed stretch is not negligible
for these small diameter rods at low speed ﬂows, and we combine them in this way following the
example for mixed convection [21]. The initial rod tip is hemispherical, but as it burns it takes on a
slightly more tapered round-nosed shape, as can be seen in Figures 2 and 3. The ﬂow-induoed stretch
around the approximately spherical rod tip is af= 3/2 U/R. The ourvature-induoed stretch around
the hemispherical ﬂames is estimated for the small samples as acurv = [3 U/R] >< [(Rﬂame-R)/R].

The analysis of all the data for ﬂame radius at each limit condition is not yet complete, so Figure
4 currently shows the ﬂammability boundary data plotted as forced stretch rate, with the data points
also marked by rod size. The data points will shift to the right once the ourvature-induoed stretch is
accounted for. Table 1 gives estimates of the ourvature-induoed stretch for each radius, based on the
ﬂame radii measured from Figure 2, to give an idea of the magnitude of the shift.

3.5 Surface Energy Balance
If we assume for long bum times that the solid phase thermal proﬁle away from the ﬂame tip has
reached an approximate steady state, we can approximate the 1D temperature proﬁle along the rod
aX1s.

Away from the regressing tip of the rod, there is a balance of heat transfer through the rod
Via conduction and convection:

The convective term is due to the steady surface regression of the rod (measured from the
eXperiment), Vr. It is assumed in this steady analysis that Vr is so small that the length of the sample
does not change significantly over the timeframe of interest I, over which AL<<L, where L is the
characteristic length of the rod. This means that changes in the temperature proﬁles are quasi-
steady for a slowly changing L.

Boundary conditions include the surface temperature at y=0 is Ts (assumed a constant
pyrolysis temperature) and the ambient temperature at y = L is Too. Non-dimensionalizing with
Y=y/L, 0 = (T-Too)/(Ts-Too), and Fe: LVr/Ots we can write

093 0295
0 = Pe 5 + E

The coefﬁcient is a solid-phase Peelet number, which is a ratio of the convective heat
transferred as the fuel regresses, compared to the conductive heat transfer from the hot surface.
Boundary conditions become 0(0)=1 and 0(1)=0. This equation is a linear, homogeneous, second
order ordinary differential equation with constant coefﬁcients, with roots 0 and -Pe for a general
solution

0(1’) = Cle'PeY+CZeO
Using the boundary conditions to evaluate C1 and C2, we ﬁnd the solution is
B(Y) = eXp( PeY) eXp( P6)
1 — eXp(—Pe)

For large Peclet numbers (Pe>1), there is a substantial change in the non-dimensional gradient
due to the increasing eXponential nature of the temperature proﬁles, since heat conducted along the
rod is eonveeted back toward the burning tip so that heat cannot penetrate too deeply along the rod.
For small Peelet numbers (PeSl), conduction dominates and the temperature proﬁles are nearly
linear. It is eounter-intuitive that the slowest burning samples will, in this steady-state, have the least
heat loss into the solid, which has been previously noted [23].

We can differentiate the 1D solution to evaluate the steady-state temperature gradient at the
regressing surface (Y=0) with decreasing Peelet number (burning rate). Solving for the temperature
gradient at the surface as a function of Peclet number, we obtain

d6 Pe
dY IYZO _ eXp(—Pe) — 1

We can use this to evaluate the conductive loss down the rod as a function of regression rate
(Fe), and estimate the ﬂame heat ﬂuX as a function of Peelet number.

The surface energy balance for the rod tip is given by

.. (9T ,. (9T - ..
qflame = Ag 6—)? IS + qrad = ’15 %lld IS + Th Lvap + 50-0154 _ Tog)
Where Lvap = 1700 J/g, m” = Vrp, 8 = 0.85, Ts = 300 0C, ks = 2.09 X 10‘3 W/em K at 300 K, kg = 5.77
X 10'4 W/em K at 800 K, p = 1.19 g/cc, L=5.9 em, and G = 5.729 X 10'12 W/em2 K4

Using these values and evaluating the surface temperature gradient as above, we can estimate
each term in the energy equation as a function of the Peelet number in Figure 5. It has been shown
[17] that the burning rate decreases nearly linearly with stretch rate until very near the quenching 0r
blowoff limits, so Pe ~ a. As mentioned above, solid conduction decreases with decreasing Peelet
number. Surface radiative loss is assumed to be constant. The energy available for fuel vaporization
decreases with decreasing Peclet number, as one would eXpect. The net ﬂame heat ﬂuX thus drops
precipitously with decreasing Peelet number.

We can compare the importance of the different losses by normalizing them with the net
ﬂame heat ﬂux (left side of energy balance, which includes gas-phase conduction and gas radiation).
In Figure 5, the solid conduction, surface radiation, and the combined solid conduction and surface
radiative loss are normalized by the net ﬂame heat ﬂux and are plotted on the right aXis. As Peclet
number decreases (rod regression rate decreases as forced stretch rate decreases), the radiative loss
ratio increases dramatically since surface radiative loss is a constant while ﬂame heat ﬂux decreases
linearly with Peclet number. The solid conduction rati0 actually falls off as Peclet number is
reduced. The combined radiative and conductive loss ratio increases at low Peclet number, and one
would expect the ﬂame to quench when the combined 10sses exceed approximately 70% 0f the net
ﬂame heat ﬂux [24, 25]. The primary reason for quenching is the reduced net heat ﬂux from the
ﬂame compared to the ongoing losses.

4. Conclusions

Twenty-four concurrent axial ﬂow ﬂammability tests with three diameters of east PMMA
cylindrical rods were performed in the MSG 0n the ISS. Oxygen concentrations in the MSG
working volume were varied during the testing from ambient 188 oxygen levels (~ 21% 02) down to
~14% 02, and oxygen concentrations before and after each test were measured with an 0n-b0ard
CSA-CP sens0r. Flow velocity through the duct was also varied by changing the fan voltage, and
measured with a h0t-wire anem0meter.

In quenching limit tests, the ﬂow was incrementally turned down and the ﬂame a110wedt0
stabilize at the new ﬂ0w condition for at least the solid-phase response time before changing it again.
For blowoff limit tests, the astronaut quickly turned up the ﬂow to obtain extinction. Complementary
5.18 second Zero Gravity Facility drop tests were conducted to compare b10w0ff limits in short and
long duration microgravity.

A ﬂammability boundary With axes of oxygen concentration and forced stretch rate is obtained

that has a distinctive shape that correlates well With a critical Damkohler number. The blowoff

branch exhibits a linear (YoX ~ a), trend that indicates there is a relatively constant critical
temperature at blowoff. The quenching branch exhibits an exponential (YoX versus a) curve Which
reﬂects importance of heat losses to drop the ﬂame temperature, causing the Arrhenius reaction rate
to slow to a critical Damkohler number While ﬂow time is plentiful. A surface energy balance is used
to show how the reductions in net ﬂame heat ﬂux at low stretch (10W regression rates) drives the
ﬂame to quenching extinction despite the fact that the losses actually decrease slightly near the limit.
