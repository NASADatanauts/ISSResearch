rived from these observations. Therefore, the initial conditions were
selected on the basis of keeping the growth chamber solution within
the metastable zone of the phase diagram, allowing the growth of the
seed but avoiding further nucleation that would spoil the interferometry
data. During the whole experiment, temperature was kept at 20 :I: 0.30
C by the APCF temperature control system (Lautensehlager, 2002).
The equilibration pathways through the solubility diagram were care-
fully studied using both computer simulation and on—ground test exper-
iments. 89.5 mg/ml solutions of lysozyme (Seikagaku E98301) con-
taining 1.2% w/V of sodium chloride (Sigma analytical grade) were |
used in the protein Chamber. The rotatory channel was ﬁlled with a ‘
gelled (0.5% w/V agarose) 1.3% w/V solution of sodium Chloride and
the salt reservoir with an ungelled 3.25% w/V solution of sodium chlo-
ride. The three solutions were buffered to pH 4.5 in 0.5 M sodium IMG00325
acetate buffer. Using these initial conditions, undisturbed growth of the ET002035 8 .
seed was achieved during the ﬁrst 100 hours of the experiment, fol-
lowed by the homogeneous nucleation of a number of very elongated
crystals (aspect ratio Lc/La 2 3, L;- being the length along the crystal-
lographic axis 1'), which indicate a very low supersaturation (Durbin &
Feher, 1986).
The APCF Maeh-Zehnder interferometer (Snell et al., 1996) pow-
ered by a 850 nm laser diode was used to collect interferograms from 1
the reactor in microgravity following a pre-programmed data acqui-
sition sequence. A pseudo phase shifting method was used to im-
prove the accuracy of the phase images. This method consists of im-
posing a small angle between the wavefronts of the test and refer-
ence beams so the “white” image (before activation of the eXper-
iment) already has a number of parallel fringes. The measurement
of fringe deviation in a small refractive indeX gradient is then more IMG010_93
accurate than the measurement of small changes in intensity (gray - ET0076'58
level) (Robinson & Reid, 1993; Breuckmann, 1993). The evaluation
of interferograms was done in the following way: every interfero-
gram was transformed to a phase image by triangulation and inter-
polation (Akima, 1978) from a dense set of points lying on inter-
ference fringes of the interferogram; the proper refractive indeX was
assigned to each fringe by fringe counting at a point far from the
seed crystal. Real phase values were obtained by subtracting the ref— 1
erence phase ﬁeld (the one computed from the reference “white” in- }
terferogram before activation) from each phase map. Phase difference 1‘
maps were transformed to concentration difference maps by using re- A
fractive indeX versus concentration calibration curves previously ob- \
tained in our laboratory by refractometry and extrapolated using the
Cauchy equation. The concentration maps obtained were corrected for
geometrical distortions using procedures explained in the “Results”
section. Figure 3
