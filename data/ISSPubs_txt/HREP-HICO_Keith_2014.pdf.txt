<r The Hyperspectral Imager for the Coastal Ocean (HICO) offers the coastal environ-
: mental monitoring community an unprecedented opportunity to observe changes in
'ﬁ coastal and estuarine water quality across a range of spatial scales not feasible with
8 traditional ﬁeld-based monitoring or existing ocean colour satellites. HICO, an Ofﬁce of
E; Naval Research-sponsored programme, is the ﬁrst space-based maritime hyperspectral
E imaging instrument designed speciﬁcally for the coastal ocean. HICO has been operating
g since September 2009 from the J apanese Experiment Module — Exposed Facility 0n the
8 International Space Station (188). The high pixel resolution (approximately 95 In at
m nadir) and hyperspectral imaging capability offer a unique opportunity for characterizing
“a a wide range of water colour constituents that could be used to assess environmental
3» condition. In this study, we transform atrnospherically corrected ISS/HICO hyperspectral
é imagery and derive environmental response variables routinely used for evaluating the
0; environmental condition of coastal ecosystem resources. Using atmospherically cor-
? reeted HICO imagery and a comprehensive ﬁeld validation programme, three regionally
2. speciﬁc algorithms were developed to estimate basic water-quality properties tradition-
E‘ ally measured by monitoring agencies. Results indicated that a three-band chlorophyll a
'8 algorithm performed best (R2 = 0.62) when compared with in situ measurement data
'3 collected 2—4 hours of HICO acquisitions. Coloured dissolved organic matter (CDOM)
2 (R2 = 0.93) and turbidity (R2 = 0.67) were also highly correlated. The distributions of
E these water-quality indicators were mapped for four estuaries along the northwest coast
0 of Florida from April 2010 to May 2012. However, before the HICO sensor can be
Q transitioned from proof—of—concept to operational status and its data applied to beneﬁt
decisions made by coastal managers, problems with Vicarious calibration of the sensor
need to be resolved and standardized protocols are required for atmospheric correction.
Ideally, the sensor should be placed on a polar orbiting platform for greater spatial and
temporal coverage as well as for image synchronization with ﬁeld validation efforts.
1. Introduction
The Clean Water Act protects waters in the USA (CWA, 1988). The objective of the CWA
is to ‘restore and maintain the chemical, physical, and biological integrity of the Nation’s
waters’. This Federal mandate authorizes states, tribes, and US territories, with guidance
and oversight from the US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), to develop and

implement water-quality standards to protect the resources of the Nation’s waterways.
Water-quality standards include designated uses, deﬁned as the services that a waterbody
supports such as drinking water, aquatic life, harvestable species, and recreation. These
standards under the CWA are applicable Within navigable waters of the USA and extend
seaward a distance of three miles from the coast. Therefore, a majority of research by the
EPA addresses scientiﬁc questions Within state waters, estuaries, lakes, rivers, and streams
Where applicable water-quality regulation could be implemented. Policymakers and envir-
onmental managers need tools enabling them to assess the sustainability of watershed
ecosystems, and the services they provide, under current and future land-use practices.
Water-quality condition has historically been assessed based on a suite of indicators
related directly to the stress of an ecosystem or can serve as an indicator of stress.
Examples are concentrations of chlorophyll a (Chl a), suspended sediment, salinity, coloured
v dissolved organic matter (CDOM), and temperature. Chl a is used as a proxy for phytoplank-
3 ton biomass and can be an indicator of increased nutrients (Devlin, Bricker, and Painting
(:3 2011; Ferreira et a1. 2011; Schaeffer et a1. 2012) or a direct measure ofpotential harmful algal
£ bloom development (Stumpf et a1. 2003). Suspended sediment concentrations are important
3 for monitoring Wind-driven re—suspens1on events (Chen 2006), a predictive factor for patho-
§ gens such as E. coli (Nevers and Whitman 2005), and a valuable tracer of anthropogenic
g disturbance to 1and(Ricker, Odhiambo, and Church). CDOM serves as a nutrient source and a
5: vector for heavy metals in water (Zhang et a1. 2011; Heyes, Miller, and Mason 2004).
g Detection from space provides a measure ofriver plume extent and transfer of organic carbon
ES (Tehrani et a1. 2013), both critical to the management of coastal aquatic resources.
E Measuring this indicator suite often requires ﬁeld teams to spend hours on boats to
4% collect data from discrete locations, Which ultimately Will not provide complete informa-
3 tion on the spatial and temporal variations of environmental processes in an estuary or a
E lake. Although this protocol Will continue to be necessary for various reasons, water-
: quality monitoring using remote-sensing technologies may provide the most practical way
E to ensure that management practices, at temporal and spatial scales relevant to environ-
2 mental managers and the general public, are achieving sustainability.
5 Over the last several decades, sate11ite technology has allowed measurements on a
: global scale, but often has poor resolution at local scales, Which are more relevant to
§ environmental managers and the general public. Remotely sensed water-quality products
g were ﬁrst developed for global ocean observations. In 1978, the Coastal Zone Color
H: Scanner (CZCS) began measuring ocean colour parameters such as phytoplankton bio-
5 mass With a pixel resolution of approximately 1 X 1 km. This satellite lasted until 1982
Q and served as a proof—of—concept for the Sea-VieWing Wide Field of View Sensor
(SeaWiFS), Which became operational in 1997. This sate11ite also had a resolution of
1 X 1 km and provided global coverage With daily revisit cycles. In 2002, the Moderate
Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) and the European Space Agency’s
Medium Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MERIS) became operational With
1 X 1 km resolution providing global coverage. MODIS had daily repeat cycles Whereas
MERIS had a 1—2 day reVisit cycle. MERIS has also collected data at 300 X 300 m pixel
resolution Whereas MODIS had several bands at 250 and 500 m resolution for use in
coastal waters. All three sensors provided important information on the global aspects of
water quality. However, the 1 km pixel resolution characteristic of all three sensors and
the Case 1 centric algorithms developed from their data have provided limited assess-
ments of near-shore Case 2 coastal waters, estuaries, and lakes. Case 1 waters are deﬁned
as those waters in Which phytoplankton are the principal constituent responsible for
variation in optical properties of the water. Case 2 waters are those waters inﬂuenced

not only by phytoplankton but also by other substances (e.g. CDOM, inorganic suspended
sediments) (Morel and Prieur 1977; Gordon and Morel 1983).

Because of these limitations, it has been difﬁcult to derive products from these sensors
that could be used by environmental managers or researchers to adequately address issues
associated with smaller estuaries or those waters in proximity to the land-water conti-
nuum. However, there have been some demonstrations of limited success in deriving
water-quality products in coastal and inland waters (Ladner et a1. 2007; Miller and McKee
2004; Gons, Auer, and Efﬂer 2008; Werdell et a1. 2009, Witter et a1. 2009).

Owing to the complex interactions between the biotic and abiotic components in
estuarine and coastal waters, approaches and methods to develop sate11ite-based water-
quality products are more complicated than in the adjacent open ocean. Currently, there is
no single method that can resolve water-quality products across the spatial continuum of

v lakes, reservoirs, bayous, estuaries, and the near coastal environment at various temporal
S scales. Furthermore, algorithms traditionally used to derive water-quality products for the
(:33 global ocean typically fail or fundamentally do not have accurate assumptions when
E applied to estuarine or coastal waters. Finally, straylight contamination and bottom
3 reﬂectance typically confound the derivation of products where environmental manage-
§ ment needs are greatest along the land—water interface (Schaeffer et a1. 2012).
g The Hyperspectral Imager for the Coastal Ocean (HICO) on the International Space Station
5: (IS S) is the ﬁrst space-based, maritime hyperspectral imaging instrument designed speciﬁcally to
5 measure water-quality parameters near the land—water interface. HICO is a pushbrooni, imaging
g spectrometer based on the Portable Hyperspectral Imager for Low—Light Spectroscopy
E (PHILLS) airborne imaging sensor. HICO was developed by the US Naval Research
4% Laboratory (N RL) for the Ofﬁce of Naval Research (ONR) as an Innovative Naval Prototype
3 (Corson 2011; Corson and DaVis 2011). ONR also supported the ﬁrst three years of operations
E including the development and operation of the HICO website at Oregon State University (0 SU).
C; HICO offers the environmental monitoring community an unprecedented opportunity
E to observe changes in coastal and estuarine water quality across a range of spatial scales
2 not feasible with ﬁeld-based monitoring. The 95 X 95 m (at nadir) spatial and S6 nm
5 bandwidth spectral (Lucke et a1. 2011) resolution of the HICO instrument offers a unique
: capability for characterizing a wide range of water colour parameters that can provide a
ﬁ detailed understanding of estuarine and near-coastal environmental conditions.
g In this article, we derive and test the robustness of algorithms to derive Chl a, CDOM
H: absorption, and turbidity from the spectral signatures of HICO images of four estuarine/
E coastal systems of northern Florida taken during April 2010—May 2012 on the 188 during
Q 188 Expeditions 24—31.
2. Methods
2.1. Field and laboratory analysis
Field surveys were conducted in four Florida estuaries along the Florida Panhandle during
April 2010 and June 2011 to June 2012. The systems selected represented a range of
optical characteristics (e.g. high vs. low particulate loads), were of sufﬁcient size to be
adequately resolved in remote-sensing imagery, and were close enough to the EPA Gulf
Ecology Division (GED) in Gulf Breeze, FL, to make sampling during an ISS overpass
feasible. The systems sampled were Pensacola Bay, Choctawhatchee Bay, St Andrews
Bay, and St Joseph Bay (Figures 1 and 2). Field sampling and sample analysis were
conducted in accordance with an approved Quality Assurance Plan (Schaeffer 2011).

5 Three of the coastal systems sampled are characterized as shallow (~4.0 m), microtidal
: (tidal range ~l .0 m) estuaries located along the northwest Florida coast. Pensacola (30° 42’ N;
§ —87° 22’ W), Choctawhatchee (30° 40’ N; —86° 62’ W), and St Andrews (30° 16’ N; —85°
§ 66’ W) bays are partially mixed, lagoonal estuaries bordered on the ocean side by a barrier
TC; island system through which a tidal inlet provides coastal water exchange with the Gulf of
5 Mexico. On the landward side, freshwater discharge is supplied ﬁom rivers that drain adj acent
Q watersheds (Figure 1). St J oseph Bay (29° 80’ N; —85° 36’ W) is a slightly deeper (~8 m) coastal
embayment partially isolated from the Gulf of Mexico by St J oseph Peninsula and is the only
waterbody in the eastern Gulf ofMeXico not inﬂuenced by the inﬂow offresh water (Figure 1).
Sampling stations were located to characterize water quality and optical properties
where HICO imagery could be acquired as well as along the major salinity gradients of
each estuary (Figure 2). A Sea—Bird 25 CTD (Sea—Bird Electronics, Bellvue, WA, USA)
was deployed to measure the vertical proﬁles of temperature, salinity, and depth.
Additional integrated instruments included Chl a, turbidity, and CDOM ﬂuorometers.
Water samples were collected 0.5 m below the surface, away from boat engines, using a
2L brown Nalgene bottle for the post-cruise analysis of Chl a and coloured dissolved
organic matter absorption. All collection bottles were triple rinsed with surface water.
Samples were typically processed within 24 hours of collection.
Water samples were ﬁltered through Whatman 47 mm GF/F ﬁlters (nominal pore
size = 0.7 pm) for chlorophyll analysis. Filters were extracted in methanol and

CDOM absorption was determined using water ﬁltered through Whatman 47 mm GF/
F ﬁlters (nominal pore size = 0.7 mm) into combustion glass ﬂasks. Absorption was
measured using a 10 cm cuvette with a Shimadzu UV1700 dual-beam spectrophotometer.
Data were collected at 1 nm intervals between 200 and 750 nm. Milli-Q deionized water
was used in the reference cell. Spectra were normalized by subtracting each wavelength
from the measured value at 700 nm (Pegau et al. 2003).

Remote-sensing reﬂectance (Rrs, sr_l) was derived using a hyperspectral surface acqui-
sition system (HyperSAS, Satlantic Inc, Halifax, Nova Scotia). The HyperSAS logged
spectral measurements of above-water radiance (LtOQ), sky radiance (Li(7t)), and down-
welling sky irradiance (EsOQ) from 350 to 800 nm (interpolated at 1 nm intervals ).
HyperSAS radiance sensors were mounted on the port side of the pilot house roof of a
25ft boat to provide 400 nadir and zenith Viewing angles (Mobley 1999). During data

v acquisition, the boat was positioned so the radiance sensors were perpendicular to the Sun’s

S azimuth and to avoid boat shadow and wake. The irradiance sensor was mounted above the

(:3 deck canopy for an unobstructed View of the sky. The above-water remote-sensing reﬂec-

g tance spectra were corrected, following the surface correction algorithm of Gould, Arnone,

3 and Sydor (2001), using the average absorption at 412 nm and the derived spectral

g scattering shape (Gould, Arnone, and Martinolich 1999). Concurrently with the

g HyperSAS acquisition, an AC-s (WET—Labs, Philmoth, OR) quantiﬁed in-Situ vertical

5: proﬁles of absorption (a) and beam attenuation (c) from 400 to 735 nm interpolated to

g every 1 nm. Temperature and salinity corrections were applied using corresponding Seabird

ES CTD data (WET—Labs, 2008). The AC—s light absorption (a), attenuation (c), and derived

E backscatter (19) values were averaged over the surface of the water column to secchi depth.

E 2.2. Autonomous underwater vehicles

C; Autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs) were deployed as part of the ﬁeld programme

E concurrently with HICO overpasses. The AUVs were operated by the Naval Research

2 Laboratory Stennis Space Center Detachment (NRL/SSC) and the USEPA Atlantic

5 Ecology Division (AED) in Narragansett, Rhode Island.

: From August 2011 to May 2012, NRL/SSC deployed a Slocum electric glider ﬁve

ﬁ times along the Florida coast. The glider collected in Situ data roughly following the 15—

% 30 m bathymetric contours just south of the Pensacola Bay. The payload provided proﬁle

% data of pressure, temperature, conductivity, backscatter (19;) at 470, 532, and 660 nm,

E beam attenuation (c), chlorophyll ﬂuorescence, and CDOM ﬂorescence.

Q A Hydroid, Konsberg Maritime REMUS 100 (Remote Environmental Monitoring
Unit) AUV was acoustically navigated along a predetermined transect Via multiple
transponder placement. The AUV autonomously surveyed inshore areas using on-board
payload sensors, which recorded Chl a, turbidity, temperature, conductivity, and salinity
data at a depth of approximately one metre. Deployments were designed to coincide with
the offshore deployments of the NRL/SSC glider and HICO overpasses. The REMUS 100
was deployed on 19 January 2012 in Escambia Bay, on 20 January 2012 in East Bay
sections of greater Pensacola Bay, and on 25 August 2011 and 21 January 2012 in
Choctawhatchee Bay.

2.3. HICO image processing
During the course of this study, 49 images were acquired from HICO for all four estuaries
from April 2010 to May 2012. Images were processed at the EPA AED and an image

"
"7","International Journal ofRemote Sensing 2933
from 28 October 2011 was processed by NRL/SSC. The highest number of images
(n = 20) was acquired from St Andrews Bay. Sixteen images were acquired from
Pensacola Bay, seven images were acquired from Choctawhatchee Bay, and siX images
were acquired from St Joseph Bay. Each image was part of a scene that covered a
50 X 200 km swath per orbit. Seven images were not processed owing to excessive
cloud cover, problems with the Sun’s positional data in the header ﬁle, or problems
warping the image during geo—rectiﬁcation. The images were acquired between 0800 and
1430 GMT from altitudes ranging from 344 to 421 km above the Earth.

Images from the estuaries were downloaded as radiometrically calibrated Level 1B
top—of—atrnosphere (TOA) at—sensor radiances from the OSU website (http://hico.coas.
oregonstateedu/index.shtml) (Figure 3, Step 1). The Level 1B data ﬁles also contained
information that allowed for image geometric correction. The data arrived as a single tar

v ﬁle, which contained 10—12 compressed ﬁles associated with each scene including an
S ASCII header ﬁle. Each image is composed of 512 cross—track pixels (samples), 87 bands

g from 400 to 900 nm, and 2000 lines in ENVI software format and stored as binary ﬁles in
8 band sequential (BSQ) format. HICO images were processed using EXELIS ENVI
E version 4.7. During Step 1, the data were converted to band interleaved format (BIL).
C; A list of acronyms and units used in the following equations is provided in Table 1.
12 To produce two—byte integer output during pre-Level 1B processing at OSU, the data
0; are multiplied by 50. Therefore, to convert the scaled integer data to geophysical units of
S W/mZ/sr/um, the Level 1B data were divided by 50 (Figure 3, Step 2).
: Owing to its low Earth orbit, the 188 is required to make altitude and orbital
ﬁ adjustments due to atmospheric drag, which result in changing solar/Viewing geometries
pg of the HICO sensor. These orbital adjustments could result in image pixels getting
:3 affected by the specular reﬂection of light from the sea surface or Sun glint. Sun-glinted
E pixels are a confounding factor in remote sensing as they may not contain any information
8 about water constituents and benthic features. Pixels affected by Sun glint are common in
wide-ﬁeld-Of—View image acquisitions from airborne and satellite missions (Hochberg,
Andrefouet, and Tyler 2003). According to Cavalli, Pignatti, and Zappitelli (2006), Sun
glint shows strong spatial variations that require individual calculation and correction for
each pixel depending on the wave state. During image processing, the method of
Goodman, Lee, and Ustin (2008) was used to independently determine the glint radiance
for each pixel in a HICO image and correct for Sun glint using the near-infrared (NIR)
signal. The major assumptions of this approach are that NIR light is strongly absorbed by
water and any signals reﬂected represent Sun glint reﬂected from the sea surface. The
amount of Sun glint in the NIR band is linearly related to the glint contribution of the
Visible bands (Hochberg, Andrefouet, and Tyler 2003).
In Step 3, each pixel in a HICO image was corrected to remove the effects of Sun glint
by subtracting radiance at 750 nm from the radiance at each wavelength (Li(7t)) (Figure 3;
Goodman, Lee, and Ustin 2008; Kay, Hedley, and Lavender 2009). An offset was applied

"
"9","International Journal ofRemote Sensing 2935
using radiances at 640 (L(640)) and 750 (L(750)) nm to prevent negative values in the
NIR due to over—correction as the corrected radiance approaches zero at 750 nm
(Goodman, Lee, and Ustin 2008; Kay, Hedley, and Lavender 2009). The process to
correct for Sun glint is expressed as follows:
Li(7t) : Li(7t) — L(750) + A, (1)
A : A + B[L(640) — L(750)], (2)
where A is the offset, and A + B are the constants. In this approach, we used the values of
Goodman et a1., which are A = 0.000019 and B = 0.1.
The HICO imagery processed at NRL/SSC was received directly from NRL/DC as
v level 1B hdf ﬁles and processed with the Naval Research Laboratory’s Automated
5 Processing System (APS). APS is capable of processing real-time and archived
(:3 AVHRR, SeaWiFS; MODIS; MERIS; VIIRS, and HICO imagery. It is a powerful,
g extendable, end-to-end system that includes sensor calibration, atmospheric correction
3 (with NIR correction for coastal waters), and bio—optical inversion (Martinolich and
g Scardino 2011). APS incorporates, and is consistent with, the latest NASA MODIS
g code (SeaDAS), which enables production of the NASA standard MODIS products
5: (such as chlorophyll from the 0C3 algorithm; O’Reilly et a1. 1998), as well as Navy-
g speciﬁc products (such as diver Visibility) using NRL algorithms.
E?
g 2.4. Atmospheric correction
3 The ﬁnal approach used to atmospherically correct HICO images (Step 4; Figure 3) was
F5 determined after an evaluation of results from three processing strategies. During the
>‘ evaluation, HyperSAS spectral signatures from stations in Pensacola Bay were used as
E references for comparison (matchups) with spectral outputs derived from the three atmo-
E spheric correction approaches. For the NRL/APS processing, the HICO hyperspectral
5 band data were convolved to a reduced band set, representing the MODIS multi-spectral
: bands, and processed in APS using the standard NASA atmospheric correction (Gordon
ﬁ and Wang 1994) used for MODIS. This approach ensured processing consistency between
“QC: ocean colour sensors, but did not address sensor inter-calibration issues. Second, HICO
H: images were processed using the ENVI Fast-Line-of—Sight Atmospheric Analysis of
5 Spectral Hypercubes (FLASSH) atmospheric correction programme to retrieve corrected
Q at-surface reﬂectances (ENVI 2009). FLASSH serves as a user interface to the radiative
transfer code MODTRAN 4 (Moderate spectral resolution atmospheric TRANsmittance)
(Berk et a1. 2000).
Finally, atmospherically corrected at-surface reﬂectances were retrieved from HICO
images using the dark pixel subtraction approach (Themistocleous et a1. 2012; Tuﬁllaro,
Davis, and Jones 2011; Chavez 1988) to remove atmospheric effects.
The dark pixel approach has been successfully applied to HICO images to retrieve
atmospherically corrected radiances from the ocean (e.g. Midway Atoll), coastal (e.g.
Columbia River estuary), and near-shore continental shelf (e.g. Clutha and Broadbay,
New Zealand) environments by Corson (2010) and Tuﬁllaro, Davis, and Jones (2011). In
the dark pixel subtraction approach, atmospheric effects are removed using the at-sensor
radiance for a reference pixel characterized by spectra whose radiances were less ‘bright’
than spectra within the image. These ‘darker’ radiances are subtracted from the total at-

In the dark pixel model of Tuﬁllaro, Davis, and Jones (2011; Equation (3)), LIOt) is

surface reﬂection, T denotes transmittance from the water surface to sensor, and LW

decomposed into (LdOt) + Lb(7t)), where Ld represents ‘clear water’ or ‘dark pixel’
radiances typical for the region and Lb, which represents radiances from ‘bright water’
v within an image.
§ The premise of the approach begins with imagining, at every pixel, the at-sensor
33 radiance that would be seen if the water was clear (i.e. an idealized spectrum). The
E difference between the idealized spectrum and the signal observed at-sensor provides
4% information (independent of the atmospheric composition) on the constituents in the water
ﬂ (Tuﬁllaro, Davis, and Jones 2011). Two basic assumptions with this approach were: (1)
g the atmospheric radiances (La) were homogeneous across the scene, such that aerosol size
5: and type did not change over the distance from the dark pixel to the bright pixels, and (2)
g the amount of light in the red portion of the spectrum emanating from the surface waters
E? of the offshore pixel was negligible. However, previous studies have shown that the
E second assumption was not entirely valid in coastal areas and may result in an over-
”? correction (Palandro 2006; Themistocleous et al. 2012). We applied a correction proce-
é dure to account for this problem (see below, Section 3.1).
<3 The atmospherically corrected radiances that resulted from FLASSH and the dark
3» pixel approach were converted from W 111—211111—1 into MW 0111—211111—1 (Figure 3; Step 5). In

5 derived using the dark pixel approach. However, there is no information on the HICO
Q image header ﬁles that allowed for the calculation of Ed. The header ﬁle information does
allow for the calculation of to, F0, and cos05. The diffuse transmittance term was derived

Because FLASSH retrieved surface reﬁectances during processing, Step 6 was not
applied for conversion of these images. However, FLASSH reﬂectances were converted to
Rrs values using Equation (7). In Steps 8 and 9, HICO Rrs images were geometrically
corrected using information in the rad_geom ﬁle associated with each image and projected
using geographic (spherical) coordinates (degree units) of longitude and latitude using
datum WGS 1984. For this step, the X and Y pixel sizes were initially set to 0.00090
(approximately 100 m; OSU-HICO 2011). In Step 10, the Image-to—Map Registration
feature of ENVI was used to compare selected landmarks (e.g. bridges, airport runways)
on a HICO image with those Viewed on a referenced ArcMap 10 GIS image of the estuary
v of interest to identify ground control points (GCPs). After adding at least three GPCs to
g the HICO image, ENVI calculated new coordinates for those points and predicted their
2 associated root-mean-square (RMS) errors. The RMS errors were errors inherent in
3 ﬁnding the exact location of a feature in both HICO scene and reference scene. Points
5 with high errors were removed and not used in the error analysis.
g Each image was also warped and rotated in ENVI using 1st degree RST (rotation,
g scaling, and translation) with the nearest neighbour re-sampling method and saved as a
1\ shapeﬁle. In Step 11, the georeferenced and warped Rrs images were imported into the
g ENVI Region of Interest (ROI) feature and overlain by GIS shapeﬁles created in ArcMap
g 10, which were representative of study estuaries. Using the ENVI ROI Tool the georefer-
E enced Rrs values at each pixel in the image were extracted (clipped) and the clipped values

C; 2.5. HICO Chlorophyll a model
E Using the dark pixel corrected Rrs data from images of Pensacola Bay (June, August, and
2 September 2011), optimal spectral bands were identiﬁed in the red and NIR wavelengths
5 to retrieve Chl a concentrations from HICO images using the three-band approach applied
: by Dall’Olmo et al. (2005) and Gitelson et al. (2008) to Case 2 waters.
§ In the approach, the model takes the form of [Rrs(7t1)_1 — Rrs(7tz)_1] * Rrs(;L3) where the
“QC: reciprocal of Rrs from two wavelengths (M, M) in the NIR to red spectrum is multiplied by
% reﬂectance of an NIR band (23) (Gitelson et al. 2011; Moses et al. 2009; Dall’Olmo,
E Gitelson, and Rundquist 2003; Gons 1999; Gower, Doerffer, and Borstad 1999; Gitelson
Q 1992). The approach assumes that (1) CDOM and detrital absorption at M are close to
those at M; (2) RrSOL3) is inﬂuenced by backscatter only, with minimal inﬂuence from
water constituent absorption; and (3) backscatter (bb(7t)) is approximately equal to the
three wavelengths (Le et al. 2013; Le et al. 2010). From a bio—optical perspective, the
three-band approach [RrsWYl — RrsﬂzYlerst) : [0131101) + aWW) — aw(kz)]/aw(k3),
where aph equals phytoplankton absorption and aw equals absorption due to water (Le
et al. 2013, 2009). Wavelength k1 is the most sensitive to absorption by Chl a. A
second wavelength (M), which is located close to M, is minimally sensitive to Chl a
absorption and corrects for absorption effects by other optically active constituents and
the third wavelength (k3) is minimally sensitive to absorption by pigments, mineral
particles, organic detritus, and CDOM (Gitelson et al. 2011; Hunter et al. 2010; Le
et al. 2009).
Gitelson et al. (2008, 2011), Moses et al. (2009) Gitelson, Schalles, and Hladik
(2007), and Dall’Olmo and Gitelson (2006) validated this approach using MERIS and

MODIS satellite data to estimate Chl a in productive coastal waters with concentrations
between 20 and 40 Mg 1—1. The approach has also be validated over a wide range of
chlorophyll values (2—50 pg 1—1 with an RSME <5.1 pg 1—1 and 2—20 pg 1—1 with an
RSME <1.7 pg 1—1) using a MERIS three-band model by Gitelson et a1. (2009).

The optimal spectral bands were determined through an iterative process using Rrs
values from 657 to 749 nm (HICO bands 45—61) using HyperSAS data (660—735 nm)
from ﬁve locations sampled during cruises FE1106 (June 2011) in Pensacola Bay and
laboratory-measured Chl a values from those stations. Initially at each station, the position
of M was determined using Rrs values at 703 and 735 nm set as placeholders for M and 23,
respectively. These values along with Rrs values from 657 Z M S 674 nm were input into
the three-band form to predict Chl a concentrations for Bands 45—48. The difference
between measured and predicted Chl a concentrations at each wavelength was derived

v and the root-mean-square error (RSME) of Chl a estimation (Gitelson et a1. 2008)

3 determined using Equation (8).

(:3 The HyperSAS band with the lowest RMSE in the wavelength range was selected as

g the position for M. To determine the position of M, the location of the previously

3 determined M and the set position of M, (735 nm) were used to again predict Chl a

g concentrations from 703 to 730 nm. The difference between predicted and measured

g values was derived and RMSE determined. The HyperSAS band in this portion of the

5: spectrum with the lowest RMSE in the wavelength range was selected as the optimal

5 position for M. Finally, 23 was determined using Rrs values from the previously deter-

? mined wavelengths for M and M. Chl a values predicted from Rrs values from 730 to

E 735 nm were compared with measured Chl a values to derive RSME values. The band

4% with the lowest RSME in this range was selected as the position for M.

3 RMSE values of the predicted Chl a concentrations were calculated from the follow-

E The HICO Chl a model was derived using Rrs values from Pensacola Bay images

23 derived from the HyperSAS datasets. These values were regressed against in Sim chlor-

E ophyll a concentrations from stations in Pensacola Bay sampled concurrently with the 188

E overpass to produce a regionally speciﬁc algorithm. Comparisons were made between the

Q measured chlorophyll values and predicted chlorophyll concentrations to identify outliers
and algorithm accuracy. Outliers in the dataset were identiﬁed using the quartile method
(NIST/SEMATECH 2012) and removed. The accuracy of the algorithm was determined
from the coefﬁcient of determination, R2, using Model 11 linear regression analysis (Laws
1997)
2.6. HICO turbidity model
An empirical relationship was derived between in Situ turbidity (NTU) from stations in
Pensacola Bay (June 2011) and Rrs at HICO band 43 (Rrs(646)). Turbidity was derived
from HICO images using the approach of Chen, Hu, and Muller-Karger (2007), which
was previously applied to MODIS/Aqua 250 m imagery from the Tampa Bay, FL, estuary.
The accuracy of the turbidity algorithm was assessed by calculating the RMSE of
the predicted turbidity and the measured turbidity from the stations in St Andrews Bay

The absorption of light due to coloured dissolved organic matter was determined follow-
ing the basic precepts of studies conducted by Bowers et a1. (2000, 2004), Binding and
Bowers (2003), and Tiwari and Shanmugam (2011). In this approach, CDOM absorptions
at 412 nm (aCDOM 412) data from Pensacola Bay (June, August, and September 2011)
were regressed against the ratio of waveband reﬂectance in the red (670 nm) and blue-
green (490 nm) as measured from HICO Rrs from those waters to derive an empirical
algorithm. Error was assessed by calculating the RMSE of the predicted and measured

g 3. Results and discussion
ﬂ 3.1. Image processing: geolocation
Er Using HICO scenes with obvious landmarks, GCPs were indentiﬁed on each image-based
g georeferenced ArcMap 10 scenes. Using coordinates from the ArcMap scenes, GCPs (and
5:} their RMS errors) were predicted for each HICO scene. Results indicated that an average
2 of siX ground control points was needed for accurate geolocation. RMS errors ranged from
E 0.7 to 3.2 m for Choctawhatchee Bay HICO images, from 0.7 to 2.8m for Pensacola Bay
é HICO images, from 0.5 to 1.1 m for St Andrews Bay images, and from 0.6 to 1.1 m for St
E J oseph’s Bay HICO images. Although the number of GCPs was small, the predicted RMS
C; errors are well below the 100 m pixel Size of HICO images.
'5 3.2. Image processing: Sun glint correction
D . . . .
: As stated prevrously, all images were processed to remove the glint radiance caused by
§ changing solar/Viewing geometries of the HICO sensor. An example of the result of the
.8 Goodman, Lee, and Ustin (2008) approach is shown in Figure 4, which is from a pixel in
:3 an 8 J anuary 2012 HICO image from Choctawhatchee Bay. In this ﬁgure, the uncorrected
E spectrum shows radiance values well into the NIR, which suggested that the entire
8 spectrum was affected by Sun glint. After processing, the shape of the corrected radiance
spectrum at that pixel has been preserved, compared to the original spectrum, and radiance
values beyond 750 nm approach zero, which is in agreement with the assumption that
NIR light is strongly absorbed by water and any signals reﬂected represent Sun glint
reﬂected from the sea surface.
3.3. Image processing: atmospheric corrections and remote—sensing reﬂectance
A HICO image of Pensacola Bay acquired on 2 June 2011 was processed using the NRL/
APS programme conﬁgured with the standard SeaDAS routines and then using wave-
lengths convolved to MODIS multispectral bands; ENVI FLASSH programme; and dark
pixel subtraction approach for atmospheric correction evaluations. The resulting spectral
signatures were compared with HyperSAS signatures from 21 stations occupied during
the ISS overpass.

g HICO hyperspectral images processed using the NRL/APS in SeaDAS mode and the
E ENVI FLASSH atmospheric correction programme did not yield satisfactory results and
‘; did not match any of the classic Case 2 spectra characteristic of the HyperSAS spectra
'5 from Pensacola Bay. HICO spectral signatures produced With the NRL/APS generally
E were under-corrected in the blue-green spectrum (Figure 5). The under-correction could
S be the result of noise in the NIR portion of the spectrum, polarization sensitivity, and/or
: sensor Inis-ealibration at blue wavelengths (400—450 nm). To help resolve these issues,
ﬁ Vicarious calibration techniques are under development (Lewis et al. 2013). In contrast, all
g the MODIS Inultispectral values agreed very well With the HyperSAS spectra (n = 42;
E R2 = 0.89; Figures 5 and 6), indicating that the problems lie With the HICO data and not
E With the NRL/APS atmospheric correction approach.
8 Spectral signatures corrected to remove atmospheric effects With the hyperspectral
module of ENVI FLASSH also did not yield satisfactory results or match the shape of any
HyperSAS spectral signatures (Figure 7). The entire spectrum was either over—corrected in
the blue-green spectrum (e.g. PB18: Redﬁsh Cove) or under-corrected in the red/NIR
region (e.g. PBll: Blackwater Bay). FLAASH is very easy to use, if the user is able to
specify appropriate input parameters that characterize the atmospheric conditions and
illumination geometry at the time of image acquisition (Moses et al. 2012). The input
parameters that describe the atmosphere serve as initial values for an iterative process in
Which atmospheric correction occurs. If actual information is not available, the user can
input default values (ENVI 2009).
These problems encountered in this study may be related to errors in the locations of
band centre wavelengths for the HICO sensor When these data are processed using ENVI
FLASSH and problems With the illumination geometry at the time of image acquisition.
The misidentiﬁcation of band centre positions has been known to introduce signiﬁcant

Moreover, in the header ﬁle of each HICO image, the user is cautioned that the image

ﬁ fell off roughly as 7C4. ‘Dark pixels’ are assumed to not scatter photons as much as land or
“QC: ‘brighter’ waters with sediments. It was also assumed that by subtracting the at-sensor
% ‘dark pixel’ radiance from the at-sensor spectra of ‘bright’ pixels, the spectra produced
5 had Rayleigh scattering effects removed and contained primarily photons scattered from
Q the constituents within the water column (Figure 9). This approach was selected as the
method for atmospherically correcting the remaining HICO images. However, with the
dark pixel subtraction approach, there was a concern as demonstrated in previous studies —
the subtraction process could create an over-correction, which results in negative Rrs
values in the blue portion of the spectrum (Moses et a1. 2009; Palandro 2006). To address
this issue, an offset (avg 0.003 sr_l) determined by Rrs values at 450 nm was applied to the
spectra to adjust reﬂectance values so as to yield positive values in the blue portion of the
spectrum (Hu et a1. 2004).
3.4. Algorithm development and tuning for estimating chlorophyll a
In general, the waters sampled had Chl a concentrations, total suspended sediment (TSS)
concentrations, and turbidity values that varied by more than a factor of 10 (Table 2). TSS

concentrations correlated weakly With Chl a measurements (Figure 10), conﬁrming that
the waterbodies sampled during this study belong to Case 2 waters (Morel and Prieur
1977). This suggested that algorithms commonly used for estimating Chl at concentrations
in Case 1 ocean waters (e.g. O’Reilly et a1. 1998) are inadequate for accurate estimations
in these Case 2 waters.

Using an optimization procedure, a three—band empirical model was developed using
HyperSAS spectral data and laboratory—extracted Chl at concentrations from Pensacola
Bay (June, August, and September 2011) to estimate Chl at concentrations from the HICO
images.

S The optimal position of M was derived by setting M and kg, at 660 and 735 rim,
: respectively, with the minimal RMSE (0.002 Mg 1‘1) occurring at 703 nm (Figure 11, solid

g 735 nm. Using this combination, the minimum RMSE (0.006) was located at 686 nm

E and k2, respectively, with the minimal RMSE (0.217) occurring at 735 nm (Figure 11,
8 dotted line).

With the optimal bands identiﬁed, spectral values at 686 (HICO band 50), 703 (HICO
band 53), and 735 nm (HICO band 58) from HICO images were used to derive the ratio
values that were proportional to Chl a concentration (Gitelson et a1. 2011; Hunter et a1.
2010; Le et a1. 2009; Dall’Olmo and Gitelson 2006). These values were regressed against
in Situ Chl a concentrations from a total of 17 stations in Pensacola Bay sampled during
June, August, and September 2011 to produce a regionally speciﬁc algorithm (Figure 12
(a), Tables 3 and 4). The algorithm was validated using measured in Sim Chl a samples
collected from April 2010 to September 2011 at 21 stations in St Andrews Bay, Pensacola
Bay, and Choctawhatchee Bay (Figure 12(19), Table 5).

The algorithm was applied to HICO images from the four estuaries, beginning in April
2010 and ending in May 2012, to map spatial and temporal changes in Chl a distribution
during the period. Figure 15(a) represents the chlorophyll distribution within
Choctawhatchee Bay from a HICO image acquired during fall 2011. This image shows

It is well known that estuaries are highly dynamic interfaces where phytoplankton
dynamics can change over tidal cycles. To observe Chl a variability associated with
sampling at different times relative to an ISS overpass, we examined the goodness—of—ﬁt
between measured and predicted Chl a values as a function of time after an ISS
overpass. Chl a samples collected within four hours of an overpass were assessed
from stations in Pensacola Bay, Choctawhatchee Bay, and St Andrews Bay sampled
during April 2010 and June to August 2011. A strong relationship (R2 = 0.62, p <
0.001, RMSE = 1.7 11g 1‘1) existed for stations (77 = 21) occupied 0—4 hours of an
overpass (Figure 12(b), Table 5).
Chl a values were also derived using the 0C3 SeaDAS algorithm with HICO data
(processed through NRL/APS). These estimates were compared with NRL glider chlor-
ophyll values collected on 28 October 2011 along the inner continental shelf waters off

E approximately constant at 1.3 Mg 1_1 with very low variability (data not shown).
2 A unique opportunity occurred on 28 October 2011 when a clear MODIS scene was
5 acquired within 7 min before the HICO overpass. Using the NRL/APS, the 0C3 algo-
: rithm Chl a and standard SeaDAS atmospheric correction were applied to both HICO
ﬁ image and MODIS scene (Figure 13(a)). During processing, the 1 km MODIS image was
,8 re-sampled to the 100 m HICO pixel size and the HICO image was georeferenced to the
:i ‘new’ MODIS image. A region-of—interest (ROI) was generated near the mouth of
B Pensacola Bay and all MODIS and HICO chlorophyll values within that ROI were
8 extracted from the two scenes. During the re-sampling process on the MODIS scene,
pixels were simply replicated to increase the resolution from 1 km to 100 m. For example,
if a 1 km MODIS pixel had a value of 1 pg 1_1 then there are now 100 pixels with that
same value for the comparison to HICO. Results showed there was agreement between the
HICO and MODIS 0C3 Chl a values than between the HICO and glider values
(m = 0.38; intercept = 0.81; R2 = 0.85; Figure 13(b)). The high R2 value indicated there
is a strong linear relationship between the two variables (i.e. the proportion of the variance
in the HICO Chl a values is accounted for by the MODIS Chl a values). However, the
non-zero intercept and the bias (slope not equal to 1) indicated that the MODIS and HICO
values are not necessarily close to each other. For example, HICO values were somewhat
higher than MODIS values at Chl a concentrations below 1.2 ug 1_1, and lower than
MODIS at concentrations above 1.2 pg 1‘1. The signiﬁcant regression of 0C3 results from
HICO and MODIS retrieved by the NRL/APS indicated that other algorithms in the
SeaDAS processing package could be applied to leverage the high spatial resolution

3.5. T urbidity and CDOM models
Turbidity is a fundamental indicator of water clarity that is a measure of the ability of
suspended material to diminish the penetration of light in aquatic systems (AGI 1974).

"
"26","2952 DJ. Keith et a1.
Variations in turbidity help trace the distribution of total suspended sediments, which are
affected by geological processes (e.g. coastal erosion) and the mobilization of pollutants
(Zhang et a1. 2011; Heyes, Miller, and Mason 2004). Turbidity can vary widely spatially
and temporally in coastal and estuarine waters. This variability results in the failure of
conventional sampling methods to accurately characterize turbidity dynamics because of
limitations in temporal and spatial sampling schemes. We empirically derived a water
clarity algorithm (Table 4) by regressing in Situ turbidity measured from 18 stations in
Pensacola Bay on 2 June 2011 against Rrs retrieved at 646 nm from a HICO image
acquired on that day (Table 6). In the approach, Rrs is assumed to be proportional to
backscatter (bb), which is equivalent to turbidity for medium to low turbid waters (Chen,
Hu, and Muller—Karger 2007). Figure 13(a) shows that HICO Rrs(646), which ranged
from 0.003 to 0.009 sr_l, was closely related (R2 = 0.72) with in Sim turbidity values
w from 0.10 to 10 NTU (Figure 14(a)). The model was validated using in Situ turbidity
5 measurements from 14 stations in St Andrews Bay (from April and June 2010) and the
2 REMUS AUV from two locations along a track in Choctawhatchee Bay on August 2011

g wavelength. This observation was conﬁrmed as results showed a strong relationship
at (R2 = 0.67; p < 0.001; RMSE = 0.56 NTU) between measured and predicted values
5: (Figure 14(b)). This relationship was consistent with turbidity values from Tampa Bay,
5 FL. An example image from St Andrews Bay acquired during spring 2011 is provided in
g Figure 15(19). St Andrews Bay generally has turbidity values from 0.2 to 2.3 NTU.

§ Several studies have shown that CDOM primarily absorbs light in the UV and Visible

2 spectral range and plays a key role in controlling light attenuation and spectral quality in

5 Atlantic and Gulf of Mexico estuaries (Keith, Yoder, and Freeman 2002; Chen et a1. 2007;

g Tehrani et a1. 2013). CDOM, the coloured fraction of dissolved organic matter (DOC), can

E be estimated by ocean sensors and can be utilized to estimate the standing stock of DOC

C; and the carbon cycle in aquatic environments (Coble 2007). Monitoring the distribution of

ﬁg CDOM at several spatial and temporal scales could provide diagnostic information on the

3; natural and anthropogenic factors affecting the capacity of these waters to provide

'5 sufﬁcient sunlight to planktonic and macrophytic vegetation for photosynthesis and

E growth. Previously, D’Sa, Miller, and Del Castillo (2006) used in Situ aCD0M(412) mea-

£ surements, collected With 14 hours of an overﬂight, and the ratio of Rrs(510) and Rrs(5 55)

E from SeaWiFS to derive an algorithm that mapped the surface values of CDOM absorp-

8 tion in the offshore waters of the northern Gulf of Mexico. Statistical analysis revealed the

E algorithm performed well With an R2 of 0.66 and an RSME of 0.23 m_l.

8 We empirically derived an algorithm to study CDOM distribution Within estuarine
waters of the Gulf coast (Table 4). The algorithm was derived by regressing in Sim CDOM
absorption measurements (aCDOM(412)), collected Within ﬁve hours of an ISS overﬂight, at
17 stations in Pensacola Bay from June to September 2011 against the ratio of Rrs
retrieved from 670 and 490 nm from HICO images acquired on those days (Table 8).
This approach assumes that in order to retrieve CDOM remotely there is a robust
relationship between the red/blue-green spectral ratio and the absorption of CDOM. The
algorithm was validated using measured CDOM absorption values, also collected Within
six hours of an ISS overﬂight, from 18 stations in Pensacola and Choctawhatchee Bays (2
June, 30 July, and 9 September 2011; Table 9) and HICO images from those days. During
this time period, aCDOM412) varied spatially and temporally from 0.6 to 3.1 m_l. A
comparison of the measured versus predicted absorption values showed an excellent
relationship (R2 = 0.93, p < 0.001; Figure 14(0)) and an RMSE of 0.21 m_l. Figure 15
(6) provides an example of the CDOM distribution in Pensacola Bay acquired during 16

4. Conclusions
HICO hyperspectral data were acquired from the surface waters of four Florida estuaries
during overﬂights of 188. Several water-quality algorithms were derived to estimate the
indicators of ecological condition. The ~6 nm spectral resolution and ~95 m spatial
resolution of HICO acquired images made this sensor unique among the previous and
v current ocean colour satellites. These attributes not only make HICO a unique tool for
S algorithm development in coastal waters, but also could provide future value for the
(:3 monitoring and management of the nation’s coasts in optically complex waters and areas
g below the spatial resolution of previous sensors. In our study, we found that the dark pixel
.3 atmospheric correction method worked very well in removing atmospheric effects from
g HICO images. Using atmospherically corrected HICO Rrs values and in Situ and labora-
ES tory data from an extensive ﬁeld sampling programme in the study estuaries, algorithms
5: were created, and tested, which successfully estimated chlorophyll concentrations, light
6 absorption due to CDOM, and water clarity as expressed by turbidity.
(\l . .
ES Although the potential beneﬁts are many, there are several issues that must be resolved
3 before HICO images and data can be incorporated into routine monitoring programmes to
4% beneﬁt decisions made by coastal managers. We suggest that HICO Vicarious calibration
8 and standardized atmospheric correction issues must be resolved, and work is under way
F5 on these (Lewis et al. 2013). During our analysis, we observed that multiple images of the
>‘ same target did not cover identical spatial coordinates and resulted in spatial off-
E sets >10 km. This issue may result from the differences between the actual and predicted
E 188 ephemeris data, which impacts the times HICO is actually operating. The predicted
5 188 orbit is used to program when to activate HICO and if the actual orbit differs slightly,
: at the time of data collection, the location of the targeted image might be off slightly.
ﬁ Images of the same area were acquired at different times of the day and at different solar
“QC: zenith/azimuth and View zenith/azimuth angles due to the ISS orbit, which is not Sun-
% synchronous. ISS altitude adjustments resulted in changes in spatial resolution and cover-
; age of the target area as scenes were collected at different altitudes owing to changes in
Q the orbit of the ISS (i.e. predicted vs. actual orbit). We recognize that this problem was
inherent with sensors ﬂown on the low orbiting 188. However, this may be beneﬁcial
when testing algorithm performance for geostationary satellites, since these satellites
measure at different times of the day and under different Viewing geometries in relation
to the Sun. The 188 orbits the Earth 16 times per day, and HICO is currently limited to the
acquisition of one image per orbit due to a combination of the time it takes HICO to
complete an image and data downlink speeds from the 188. In addition, during this study,
several logistical conﬂicts with supply module dockings and general 188 operations led to
rescheduling of planned image acquisitions and complications (e.g. logistical difﬁculties
associated with scheduling ﬁeld data collections at the time of an ISS overpass) because
uncertain ISS ephemeris data beyond a two week time window made predicting the orbital
path of the ISS (and image targeting) difﬁcult more than two weeks into the future.
Additionally, HICO target overpass information was communicated only hours-to-
days in advance based on a predictive model that incorporated ephemeris (orbit) and

"
"32","2958 DJ. Keith et a].

predicted mean altitude parameters. Variations in ephemeris and oscillations in altitude
made reliable estimates for 188 overpasses difﬁcult. The uncertainty associated with
overpass predictions negatively impacted the potential to effectively deploy ﬁeld crews
to implement sampling protocols in an efﬁcient and timely manner.

Because satellite-based, hyperspectral data have been rarely available for scientiﬁc
investigations, HICO has the potential to be a valuable monitoring tool owing to its high
spectral and spatial resolutions and the corresponding ability to obtain spectral data near
the land—water interface where water-quality managers continue to focus and humans may
have the high probability of interacting with the aquatic environment. However, for HICO
to transition from a proof—of—concept project to full application, the sensor needs to be
placed into a polar orbit conﬁguration to provide a stable well-characterized platform for
greater spatial and temporal coverage and geometric ﬁdelity. Furthermore, a polar orbiting

v platform would be highly predictable, allowing image synchronization with any ﬁeld
3 validation effort. This observation is consistent with the planning of NASA and other
(:33 agencies to launch several ocean colour missions (e.g. GEO-CAPE, ACE, HyspIRI) with
g hyperspectral capacity in the future (NRC 2007).
