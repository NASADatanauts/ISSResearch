The fractal scaling of the long-term heart rate variability (HRV) reﬂects the ’intrinsic’ autonomic regulatory system. Herein, we
examine how microgravity on the ISS affected the power—Iaw scaling B (beta) of astronauts during a long-duration (about 6 months)
spaceﬂight. Ambulatory electrocardiographic (ECG) monitoring was performed on seven healthy astronauts (5 men, 52.0 $4.2 years
of age) ﬁve times: before launch, 24i5 (F01) and 73 :5 (F02) days after launch, 15 :5 days before return (F03), and after return to
Earth. The power—Iaw scaling B was calculated as the slope of the regression line of the power density of the MEM spectrum versus
frequency plotted on a Iogm—Iogm scale in the range of 0.0001—0.01 Hz (corresponding to periods of 2.8 h to 1.6 min). B was less
negative in space (—0.949 i 0.061) than on Earth (—1.163 i 0.075; P < 0.025). The difference was more pronounced during the awake
than during the rest/sleep span. The circadian amplitude and acrophase (phase of maximum) of B did not differ in space as
compared with Earth. An effect of microgravity was detected within 1 month (F01) in space and continued throughout the
spaceﬂight. The intrinsic autonomic regulatory system that protects life under serious environmental conditions on Earth is altered
in the microgravity environment, with no change over the 6-month spaceﬂight. It is thus important to ﬁnd a way to improve
conditions in space and/or in terms of human physiology, not to compromise the intrinsic autonomic regulatory system now that
plans are being made to inhabit another planet in the near future.
