The normal growth rates of the {110} faces of tetragonal hen egg—white lysozyme crystals, R, were
measured as a function of the supersaturation 0' parameter using a reﬂection type interferometer
under ,uG at the International Space Station (NanoStep Project). Since water slightly evaporated
from in Sim observation cells during a long—term space station experiment for several months,
equilibrium temperature Te Changed, and the actual 0', however, signiﬁcantly increased mainly due
to the increase in salt concentration CS. To correct 0', the actual CS and protein concentration Cp,
which correctly represent the measured Te value in space, were ﬁrst calculated. Second, a new
solubility curve with the corrected CS was plotted. Finally, the revised 0' was obtained from the new
solubility curve. This correction method successfully revealed that the 2.8% water was evaporated
from the solution, leading to 2.8% increase in the CS and Cp 0f the solution. (C) 2015 AIP Publishing
