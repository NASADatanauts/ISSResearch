takahasms®confga£0jp Prostaglandin (PG) D2 is a lipid mediator related to immunity and

inﬂammation through the activation of two types of receptors, the
Received 26 March 2010 D-type prostanoid receptor (DP) and the chemoattractant receptor-
Accepted 1 June 2010 homologous molecule expressed on Th2 cells (CRTH2), and is known
to cause contractions in smooth muscle in the airway via DP and to
mediate the chemotaxis of eosinophils and basophils into the lung via
CRTH2 (Matsuoka et al., 2000; Hirai et 01., 2001). Haematopoietic
PGD synthase (H-PGDS) is known to be expressed in mast cells,
antigen-presenting cells and Th2 lymphocytes (Lewis et 01., 1982;
Tanaka et 01., 2000) and produces PGD2 from cyclooxygenase-derived
PGHZ, a common precursor of various PGs (Kanaoka & Urade,
2003). Nonsteroidal anti-inﬂammatory drugs such as indomethacin
and aspirin, both of which inhibit cyclooxygenase, suppress immune
and inﬂammatory reactions by decreasing the production of all types
of prostanoids, including cytoprotective and anti-inﬂammatory PGs,
and induce adverse effects (Takeuchi et al., 2001; Halter et 01., 2001).
Therefore, H-PGDS—speciﬁc inhibitors are thought to be more useful
lead compounds for anti-allergic and anti-inﬂammatory drugs, espe-
cially for the treatment of asthma, by decreasing the signals of PGDZ
mediated by both DP and CRTH2. Aritake et al. (2006) reported the
three-dimensional structure of human H-PGDS in complex with an
orally active H-PGDS—speciﬁc inhibitor, 4-benzhydryloxy-1-[3-(1H—
tetrazol-S-yl)-pr0pyl]-piperidine (HQL-79), which acts as an anti-
allergic drug, and elucidated the binding mode of HQL-79 within the
catalytic pocket of H-PGDS. To develop more effective compounds,
we have designed several novel H-PGDS inhibitors using HQL-79 as
a lead compound and determined their binding modes in the enzyme—
‘ inhibitor complexes through high-resolution X-ray crystallographic
I '. analyses. During a series of high-quality protein crystallization
0 experiments on the International Space Station (188) from 2003 t0
* 2008 which were funded by the Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency
(JAXA), we focused on high-resolution crystallization and Obtained
' high-quality crystals of H-PGDS. In this report, we report the puri-
ﬁcation and microgravity crystallization and provide a summary of
the preliminary X-ray diffraction analysis of complexes of H-PGDS
with three novel inhibitors for use in designing drugs based on its
three-dimensional structure.
