LONG-TERM GOALS
The Navy has a requirement to rapidly and covertly characterize the coastal environment in support of
J 0th Strike Initiatives. Over the past 12 years we have demonstrated that spaeebome hyperspeetral
remote sensing is the best approach to covertly acquire data 011 shallow water bathymetry, bottom
types, hazards to navigation, water clarity and beach and shore trafﬁeability to meet those
requirements. The long term goal of this work is to put a hyperspeetral imager capable of making the
appropriate measurements in space to demonstrate this capability.
OBJECTIVES
The obj eetive of this work is to put a hyperspeetral imager in space to demonstrate the ability to
covertly acquire data 011 shallow water bathymetry, bottom types, hazards to navigation, water clarity
and beach and shore traffieability. The proposed activities are designed to move us closer to ﬂying
either the Hyperspeetral Imager for the Coastal Ocean (HICO) or the Coastal Ocean Imaging
Spectrometer (COIS) or both to demonstrate the spaeebome capability, to advance methods of
processing and analyzing hyperspeetral data of the coastal ocean and to enhance community awareness
of the need for hyperspeetral imaging of the coastal ocean.
APPROACH
Iproposed two tasks over the two year period (FY 08-09):
1. Complete publications on three topics using the in situ and PHILLS airborne hyperspeetral data
from the LEO-15, New J ersey, Mobile Bay, Alabama and Monterey Bay, California experiments. The
ﬁrst is 011 the in situ optical data form all three sites, the second is 011 sealing of hyperspeetral data to
resolve coastal features using the LEO-15 data and the third is a comparison of the three sites using the
PHILLS data.
2. Iwill continue my active support for ﬂying HICO 0n the International Space Station (188) and
C018 011 a spacecraft of opportunity. It is critical to get this technology in space to demonstrate its full
utility for naval applications. At the request of Mike Corson (Naval Research Laboratory) the
Principal Investigator for HICO and C018 1 continue to be the Proj eet Scientist for both HICO and
C018.

Our work is focused on the coastal ocean and a maj or issue for the coastal ocean is that the standard
case 1 algorithms used to calculate chlorophyll and other water properties assume that phytoplankton
with an associated level of Colored Dissolved Organic Matter (CDOM) and water itself are the only
optically active components. In coastal waters high levels of CDOM from rivers and coastal runoff,
large phytoplankton blooms, sediments from rivers, 0r resuspension from the bottom are all signiﬁcant
optical components that need to be considered as part of the optical signature. As a consequence many
researchers are moving away from the case 1 waters assumptions and directly calculating Inherent
Optical Properties (IOPs) from remote sensing data (IOCCG, 2006). To develop and validate IOP
algorithms for coastal waters it is essential to collect proﬁles of IOPs and simultaneous water samples
for further analysis for phytoplankton, suspended particulates and CDOM. To accomplish this we
developed the Profiling Optics and Water Return (POWR) system (Rhea et al., 2007). POWR is used
to measure temperature, salinity and a suite of IOPs 0f the upper 100 m and collect up to 8 water
samples at selected depths. Data is displayed in real-time 0n the ship and that data can be used to
select the depth for water samples. We are using the data collected with POWR to characterize a
diversity of coastal environments. In Snyder, et al. (2008) we reported a study of optical scattering and
backscattering 0f particulates for three coastal sites that represent a wide range of the optical properties
found in US. coastal waters. The 6000 scattering and backscattering spectra collected for this study
can be well approximated by a power-law function of wavelength. The power-law exponent for
particulate scattering changes dramatically from site to site (and within each site) compared to
particulate backscattering where all of the spectra - except possibly the very clearest waters - cluster
around a single wavelength power-law exponent of -0.94. Simultaneous Particulate Organic Matter
(POM) and Particulate Inorganic Matter (PIM) measurements from the water samples are available for
some of our optical measurements and site-averaged POM and PIM mass-speeiﬁc cross sections for
scattering and backscattering were derived. Cross sections for organic and inorganic material are
different at each site and the relative contribution of organic and inorganic material to scattering and
backscattering depends on the relative amount of material that is present at each site.
Current ocean color sensors, for example SeaWiFS and MODIS, are well suited for sampling the open
ocean. However, coastal environments are spatially and optically more complex and their
characterization require higher spatial resolution sensors equipped with additional spectral channels.
In an earlier study (Davis, et al, 2007) we analyzed the spectral characteristics and spatial scales of
variability in airborne hyperspectral data of a harmful algal bloom in Monterey Bay, CA using
semivariogram analysis. The results indicated the need for a channel near 709 nm (as found 011
MERIS) for the detection of these large surface blooms. Also, we found a continuum of spatial scales
with the dominant scales being 150 to 300 m depending on the image analyzed. Now we are applying
the same approach to look at optically shallow environments including coastal waters at the LEO-lS
site at Tuekerton, NJ, the Bahamas Bank near Lee Stocking Island and Looe, Key, FL and comparing
these results with the results for optically deep waters.
We originally used the semivariogram technique to analyze a time series of images of the northeast
corner of Monterey Bay off the coast of central California. The statistics reported here are the lagged
distance and semivarianee values using “Queen’s move” pixel pairs (calculated with the software
package, ENVI, ITT Visual Information Solutions, Boulder, CO). Queen’s move calculates the
squared difference over all pairs of pixels in the image in all eight directions. For a given wavelength,
the nugget, sill, and range was determined by plotting the semivarianee y(h), over distance between

2

"
"4","pixel pairs, h. For the commonly used spherical model of saturating semivarianee, y(h), With increased
distance, h, the equation for a theoretical semivariogram is as follows:
y(h) = Co + el[(3h/2a) — 0.5(h/a)3]
The non-zero intercept or nugget of the variogram, 00 ,determines the degree of unresolved variability;
for sensor comparison it can represent the degree to Which the particular pixel size captures the
underlying phenomenon. The range, a, of a semivariogram determines how quickly the underlying
variability reaches a global maximum, essentially the distance to Which the structure of a variable is
spatially dependent. The sill, cl, determines the total variance resolved in the image or region of
interest. Equations based on real data may exhibit much more complex behavior than the theoretical
spherical model With multiple nodes often apparent at distances less than the sill.
For the optically deep waters of Monterey Bay better than 90% 0f the variance is resolved in the 10 m
data. This is not the case When the data are binned to 100 or 300 m (Fig.1). One hundred meters does
a reasonable job resolving 60 to 80% 0f the variance. However, When binned to 300 m we only
resolve 60% to as little as 30% 0f the variance. In particular, only 30% 0f the variance is resolved at
300 m for the data from the 15th. This well mixed case is more typical for many coastal regions.

F ig. 1. Airborne hyperspectral data for Monterey Bay binned to 100 m (a, c)
and 300 m (b, d). For these optically deep waters 100 m data was adequate to resolve
60 to 80% 0f the variability in the scene (nugget (co) is 0.2 to 0.4). The 300 m
data only resolved 60% to as little as 30% 0f the variability.
The first optically shallow environment was analyzed using a Portable Hyperspeetral Imager for LOW-
Light Spectroscopy (PHILLS, DaVis et a1. 2002) image from the Coastal Benthic Optical Properties
(COBOP) experiment at Lee Stocking Island. The area of the image analyzed includes seagrass beds,
coral reefs and sandy bottom (Fig. 2). The longer wavelength channels (680 and 710 nm) (10 not

the image. The wavelengths that do image the bottom (440, 490 and 5 60 nm) show a continuum of
space scales down to the sampling scale of 1.9 m.
Figure 3 shows the PHILLS image of the Mullica River Estuary mud ﬂats Which are at a depth of 1 t0
5 m. In this very shallow environment all of the channels image the bottom at least in the shallower
parts of the image. All of the channels show the same semivariogram With a continuum of spatial

image and is seen as a leveling off of that data (Fig. 3). An additional node is seen at 400 m Which is
likely not associated With bottom features, but With the water column features in the upper part of the
image.
Figure 5 shows the results of analysis of data from NASA’s Hyperion 0n EO-l (Ungar, et a1, 2002) for
a scene of Looe Key and surrounding coral reefs and deeper waters in the Florida Keys. The
semivariograms for the 440, 680 and 710 nm channels show spikes reﬂecting the low signal-to-noise
ratio of these channels Which limits the ability to resolve ocean features. The 680 and 710 nm
channels do not penetrate the water very far and thus do not resolve the bottom features Which
dominate the scales of variability. By contrast the 490 and 5 60 nm channels d0 penetrate deeply into
the water and they show a continuum of scales associated With the bottom features similar to the
results for Horseshoe Reef and the Mulliea River Estuary.

"7","A comparison of the semivariograms for the four optically shallow environments shows similar
patterns (Fig. 6). Because of issues with 440 nm and 710 nm channels in the Hyperion sensor the best
comparison is made using the 490 nm channel. All of the benthie environments show a continuum of
bottom features down to the scale of sampling. Sampling at 30 m GSD (vertical line in Fig. 6b)
resolves 70% or more of the variance in these scenes. Clearly additional information can be gained
with ﬁner spatial sampling, however, this is extrememy costly interms 0f the size and cost of the
instrument, the amount of data to process and the area that the sensor can cover. Thus 30 m GSD is a
suitable compromise for a space sensor designed for sampling optically shallow ocean scenes.
By comparison 60 to 80% 0f the spatial information in the Monterey Bay scene is resolved at 100 m
(Fig. 1). This is indicative of the spatial scales of water column features in coastal waters including
fronts, algal blooms and slicks. Thus a system designed for sampling the water column only can be
designed to sample at 100 m.

I continue to support the Naval Research Laboratory in the effort to ﬂy COIS (Wilson and Davis,
1999) 011 a spacecraft of opportunity to provide high resolution hyperspectral data for the coastal
ocean. Each year we have presented COIS t0 the Navy and DOD Space Experiment Review Boards
(SERBs) and received high rankings. The current ranking for C018 is 4 out of 30 011 the 2008 Navy
SERB list and 10 out of 51 011 the 2007 DOD SERB list. While HICO data will be 100 m GSD optimal
for characterization of optically deep coastal waters, COIS would provide the 30 m GSD data optimal
for optically shallow waters.

"8","The Hyperspectral Imager for the Coastal Ocean (HICO; Corson et a1., 2007) program is the ﬁrst
demonstration of environmental characterization of the coastal zone using a spaceborne maritime
hyperspectral imager. HICO is sponsored by the Ofﬁce of Naval Research as an Innovative Naval
Prototype (INP), and will demonstrate coastal products including water clarity, bottom types,
bathymetry and on-shore vegetation maps. As an INP, HICO will also demonstrate innovative ways to
reduce the cost and schedule of this space mission by adapting proven aircraft imager architecture and
using Commercial Off—The-Shelf (COTS) components where possible. In J anuary 2007 HICO was
selected for ﬂight 011 the International Space Station (188). HICO is an imaging spectrometer based on
the PHILLS airborne imaging spectrometers (Davis, et a1., 2002) with 100 In Ground Sample Distance
(GSD) and a spectral range is 0.4 to 1.0 microns sampled at high resolution and then binned t0 5 11m.
The 188 orbital inclination is 52 degrees which is not sun synchronous and thus we will be able to
observe target areas at all times of the day for understanding diurnal changes and to prepare for
possible future ocean color sensors in geostationary orbit. HICO is being integrated and ﬂown under
the direction of DOD's Space Test Program. HICO will be combined with another NRL instrument
RIADS as the HICO/RAIDS Experiment Payload (HREP). HREP is manifested 0n the J apanese
Experiment Module-Exposed Facility (JEM-EF) 0n the ISS. HICO ﬂight hardware (Fig. 1) was
assembled and tested and calibrated at NRL over the past year. The ﬂight hardware passed its
acceptance test and was delivered for integration into the HREP package in July 2008. It is currently
scheduled for launch in September 2009.

description of an IOP proﬁling system that provides real-time IOP data and the ability to collect water
at selected depths based on that data. Then we published a paper (Snyder, et a1., 2008) 011 the optical
measurements collected with that system describing a diversity of US coastal waters. Another paper
(Lee et a1., 2007) describes the development of a new method for atmospheric correction and
processing of Hyperion data from the Florida Keys. We continue to do analysis of data from COBOP,
HyCODE and other experiments to address the issues of algorithm development and spectral and
spatial sampling in the coastal ocean. Also, the HICO ﬂight hardware has been completed and is being
integrated for ﬂight 011 the 188 in 2009. HICO will be the ﬁrst imaging spectrometer designed for
coastal ocean imaging to be ﬂown in space.
IMPACT/APPLICATIONS
The long term goal of this work is to put a hyperspectral imager capable of making the appropriate
measurements in space to demonstrate the capability of this technology for the rapid and covert
characterization of the coastal ocean to support naval operations around the world. We will use data
from HICO 0n the 188 to demonstrate that capability beginning in the fall of 2009. The work
completed this year is another incremental step towards that goal.
