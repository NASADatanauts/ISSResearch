This article gives an overview about experimental diagnostic techniques for the investigation of rareﬁed
ﬂows with a special focus on techniques applicable to high-enthalpy ﬂows occurring e.g. in electrical
thrusters or plasma wind tunnels. Classical intrusive techniques like Pitot, heatﬂux, ana’ enthalpy probe
as well as mass spectrometry are introduced as well as non-intmsive methods like emission and
absorption spectroscopy and laser—ina’ueea’ﬂuoreseenee (LIF) measurements. Here, main emphasis is laid
on the methods applied at the IRS in order to illustrate the methods by sample results.

1.0 INTRODUCTION

The dream of every scientist and engineer dealing With rareﬁed, usually high-enthalpy and non-
equilibrium ﬂows is a (preferably single) diagnostic method capable to measure the distribution functions
of every single degree of freedom (translational and internal, including excitation) for each appearing
species, including eventually ions and electrons, and, of course, at every local position and at every time.
If this method existed, the huge efforts spent for the theoretical and numerical simulation of such ﬂows
would most probably be obsolete, except maybe for cost reasons. Unfortunately (or fortunately), this
method does not eXist. The available techniques, the keys to the secrets of rareﬁed ﬂows, give us just some
selected, in most cases macroscopic information about temperatures, species, heat ﬂuxes, etc. Many of
these measurement data give therefore simply some macroscopic information about the occurring effects
and often one has to solve a so-called inverse problem in order to achieve some insight into the origins of
these phenomena. In addition, many methods require some assumptions about the distribution of the
energy into the different degrees of freedom or in some cases also about the certain distribution function
itself. As the nature of rareﬁed ﬂows shows in the most interesting locations a more or less stronger
deviation from an equilibrium Maxwellian distribution function, these assumptions may lead to signiﬁcant
systematic measurement errors.

This article intends to give a ﬁrst overview about these “keys” to the secrets of rareﬁed ﬂows, With
emphasis given to the methods developed and applied at the IRS, especially designed for the
characterisation of ﬂows produced by electrical thrusters and Within the plasma Wind tunnels for re-entry
simulation. A similar article has been presented in [2] — here, some additions concerning newly developed
methods and strategies are summarized.

For engineering purposes it is in many cases sufﬁcient to obtain the information about the distribution of
the available energy into the different degrees of freedom, i.e. one has to measure as much as possible
values incorporated in the equation

2.0 INTRUSIVE MEASUREMENT TECHNIQUES
Mechanical probes, mass spectrometry, and electrostatic probes belong to the group of intrusive
measurement techniques. They are all suitably constructed probes being mounted in the stream to be
investigated. This differs from the optical measurement techniques Which are described in the next section.
Probes applied at the IRS can essentially be divided into their measurement goal, i.e.
° Pressure probes for total and static pressure
° Aerodynamic wedge probes for static pressure and Mach number in supersonic ﬂows
- Heat ﬂux probes
- Enthalpy probes
° Solid-state electrolyte probes for oxygen partial pressure
° Mass spectrometry for species densities and energy distribution
° Electrostatic probes for plasma potential, electron density, temperature and energy distribution,
ion temperature, ﬂow velocity and direction
° Radiometer probes for radiation heat ﬂux
In practice, these supposedly simple measurements techniques are already very difﬁcult. A more or less
complex theory is hidden between determining the basic parameters and ascertaining the parameters Which
are actually of interest, especially in the ease of enthalpy and heat ﬂux. A brief overview of each technique
is given in the following.
2.1 Pressure Probes
With Pitot probes it is possible to measure the dynamic or total stagnation pressure of the ﬂow by
connecting them either to a differential pressure gauge inside or to a total pressure gauge outside of the
vacuum tank. Fig. 2 depicts the “spherical head’ Pitot probe Which has an identical geometry as a material
support system used for the investigation of candidate thermal protection materials, and Fig. 3 a mini-
aturized probe Which is used for local measurements at very high heat ﬂuxes of more than 10 MW/mz, e.g.
also in electrical thrusters [3].
When using Pitot probes, one must generally differentiate between two cases: measurement in a subsonic
or a supersonic ﬂow. In the ﬁrst case, the conditions are relatively simple. The Bernoulli equation is valid
whereby the simple equation
poo 2
p0 : poo + —V00 (2)
2
at Mach numbers of Ma > 0.3 must be replaced by the Bernoulli equation for compressible ﬂows. If
friction effects are neglected and assuming that the changes in the condition run lengthwise isentropieally
along the lines, the following connection eXists between the ﬂow parameters:
K —1 ,000 V: E
p0 :poo[1+_——] 9 (3)
K poO 2
whereby K means the averaged adiabatic exponent, p0 represents the pressure in the stagnation point and
poo, poo, v00 the quantities of the undisturbed ﬂow. With that one can, for example, deduce the density from
the pressure measurement When the speed and K are known.
In supersonic ﬂows a compression shock forms in front of the probe Which results in a loss of total

pressure. The probe measures the total pressure p0 after the shock. Assuming that the compression shock
runs perpendicular to the initial direction of ﬂow and the changes in the condition run isentropioally in
front of and behind the shock, then the following is valid for pg:
L
2 2 [(—1
K — 1 2 (K + 1) Ma
2 —Ma — 00 . 4
po 2 |:4KZWa2—2(K—l) p 0

Here Ma is the Mach number in front of the shock and K, on the other hand, is the averaged adiabatic
exponent. If the Mach number is additionally determined, e.g. With a wedge probe, then the average
adiabatic exponent can be calculated from this last equation.
The equations presented so far are derived under the assumption of a continuum ﬂow. A variety of error
sources can then be identiﬁed if the ﬂow shows a strong deviation from thermodynamic equilibrium or as
soon as rarefaction becomes dominant. Among those source are for example:

- Thermal diffusion effect: High temperatures near the probe bore hole can affect the pressure by
thermal diffusion. However, most probes are fully cooled and wall temperatures can be expected
to be below 350 K due to the very high heat conductivity of the material (usually copper).

- Fluctuations: So far, no attempt has been made as the information is too uncertain. Similar
situations can be considered for the acoustic response of the measurement system (the probe,
tubing, and pressure gauge volume). No analysis of this effect is possible for supersonic turbulent
ﬂow. Estimates give a potential error in the order of 10% as a border line [1].

° Viscous and rareﬁed ﬂow effects: The total pressure measurements are affected by low density or
low probe Reynolds numbers. Correspondingly, corrections are often given as semi-empirical
relations that either depend on the Knudsen number or on the Reynolds number. To distinguish
between the continuum application and the rareﬁed ﬂow case, the probe is then named Pattarson-
probe, indicating also that other equations are valid than the abovementioned.

The latter of the mentioned effects is a decisive parameter for the measurement of Pitot pressure. For the
analysis With respect to the signiﬁcance of Viscosity, the Knudsen number Kn or the Reynolds number is
often used. The former describes the ratio of mean free path 9» of the ﬂow particles and a characteristic
length L of the measurement problem, such as the bore hole diameter. However, many authors do not
distinguish between different probe designs i.e. different probe geometries such as spherical or cylindrical
and the dependence on the Mach number is not reported. A deeper analysis With respect to an analysis of
the signiﬁcance of probe geometry is made in [1]. For understandable reasons the authors switch to a
depiction depending on the Reynolds number. The general outcome is that there is a Wide spreading of
data as the relation now depends on Reynolds and Mach numbers. Simultaneously, the data vary due to the
differences in probe geometry.

2.2 Heat Flux, Catalysis and Enthalpy Probes
Heat transfer to a body exposed to high-enthalpy, plasma ﬂow is of special interest for re-entry simulation.
However, for the heat ﬂux measurement the material of the probe itself is also important because the heat
transfer may vary depending on the catalytic activity of the surface material. Also, the surface temperature
of the probe may change the result since it affects the recombination rate and the emission coefﬁcient.
Copper is mostly used as a standard reference material for heat ﬂux probes as it has a relatively high
catalytic efﬁciency. However, it is not an ideal material because in an oxidizing atmosphere it forms
different oxides With different eatalyeity leading to an almost unpredictable amount of the chemical
energy portion Which is converted to measurable heat ﬂux. Indeed, even With a relatively high catalytic
efﬁciency of the surface, it is not guaranteed that the equivalent “fully catalytic” heat ﬂux is measured
under all conditions.
Both, stationary and transient heat ﬂux measurement devices are used at the IRS (Figs. 4-5). The actual
probes are inserts in the front plate of a water-eooled support system, consisting of either a water-eooled
tube or a Gardon Gauge for stationary or a heat sink slug for transient measurements. The probes can be
coated and the slug can be made of copper or other materials like tungsten or SiC to investigate the
inﬂuence of the surface catalytic activity [5, 6].
2.2.1 Stationary Heat Flux Measurement
Two different principles are in use for stationary heat ﬂux measurement: Calorimetrie and Gardon gauge
probes. With the ealorimetrie method the heat ﬂux to a water-eooled, relatively cold surface is measured
(Fig. 4). From the heat Which is carried off by the cooling water, one obtains the heat ﬂux q' onto the front
surface AS by measuring the temperature difference AT between the in- and outlet of a cooling mass ﬂow
rate me With a speciﬁc heat capacity c:C according to
q'zﬂccAT. (5)
AS
While operating the probe, the cooling ﬂow rate should be high enough to guarantee sufﬁcient cooling but
low enough to keep the temperature difference between the in- and outlet in a measurable level.
With the other method, the Gardon gauge named after its inventor Robert Gardon, the heat ﬂux is
determined from the temperature gradient Which forms between the centre and the edge of a circular foil.
It consists of a heat sink in form of a hollow cylinder usually made of copper and a foil attached to the
front side typically made of eonstantan. The eonstantan foil is connected With a copper Wire in the centre
(Fig. 6). If the heat sink is kept at a constant temperature, for example by embedding it in a water-eooled
sample, a radial temperature drop forms on the foil. Assuming that the front and back sides of the foil do
not release any heat and that temperature gradients across the thickness S of the foil are negligible, the
following equation results from the parameters depicted in Fig. 7 for stationary temperature distribution:

Here T m is the stationary temperature of the foil at the radius r and ﬂ. is the heat conductivity of the foil.

values for 10 and a one obtains for oonstantan:

q = —izAT(1 + 00011520) —2 . (8)
2026.25 R m
The dependence of the temperature difference on the heat ﬂuX to be measured is obviously not linear. This
disadvantage can, however, be compensated because two thermal element transitions form in the center
and at the edge of the foil Where the copper cylinder or rather the Wire and the oonstantan foil are
connected. The temperature difference calculated above eXists between the two contact points leading to a
resulting thermal voltage Which can be expressed for a oopper-oonstantan combination by
U = 0.0381AT(1+ 0.0011720) [m V]. (9)
The ﬁgures in brackets of the last two equations are practically identical so that the measured thermal
voltage becomes directly proportional to the heat ﬂux:

An advantage of the Gardon gauge is the compact design. The dimensions are usually only a few mm in
diameter so that several sensors can easily be integrated into a probe. Also, the response times are very
short so that fast heat ﬂux ﬂuctuations can be detected.
At the IRS, these heat ﬂux sensors are equipped With surface layers of different materials to study catalytic
effects. However, the reduction of the heat ﬂux from measured data is not as easy as for the copper-
eonstantan ease anymore.

t < 0: temperature of the probe = T wO = const., heat ﬂux q' = 0 (12)
t> 0: T=T(x,t), T(x=0, t) = Tw(t) . (13)
Two different methods, the thin wall and the thick wall method eXist. They differ from each other in the
realization of the necessary boundary conditions.
With the thin wall method the heat ﬂuX is assumed to be constant throughout the entire thickness of the
probe, i.e.
qx=02q.x=s ' (14)

The solution to the Fourier equation can then be Simpliﬁed for Fourier numbers F 0 = a_2 > 0.3 . If the

. ,0 dT (15)

q p dt
The ,0 and Cp represent the density and speciﬁc heat capacity of the material, respectively. With a probe
body made of copper With a thickness of 10 mm, the condition F0 > 0.3 is for example fulﬁlled after a
measurement time of tmm > 0.27 S. Although the theory of the non-stationary thin wall method neglects
heat ﬂuxes in a radial direction, in practice this condition cannot be completely fulﬁlled. A simple
estimate shows, however, that these heat ﬂuxes do not interfere With the measurement as long as the
heating of the body does not last longer than a certain maximum time tmax:

tmaX << i — . (16)

With the non-stationary thick wall method one assumes that the temperature on the back side of the
sample body does not rise during the measurement. The solution to the Fourier equation While keeping
this boundary condition in mind is then

Assuming that the heat ﬂux is constant over time, the solution to the Fourier equation for this case is
2 t

In contrast to the thin wall method, there is no demand for a minimum test time rm. On the other hand, it
is only valid as long as the temperature increase has not spread over the entire measurement element. That
is T ( oat) is no longer equal to T W0.
The thin wall method requires the knowledge of the material constants ,0 and cp only, Whereas the thick
wall method needs also the heat conductivity 1 of the sample body. Because this parameter is very
difﬁcult to determine, it can be Viewed as a disadvantage. On the other hand, the thick wall method offers
the possibility to measure the entire proﬁle at once While passing through the stream because the heat ﬂuX
g(t) can be calculated from the temperature-time dependency. This is impossible With the thin wall
method, Where an existing proﬁle must be detected by individual measurements at various positions.
A recently developed new method of heat ﬂuX measurements based on the solution of the inverse heat
conduction problem uses the basic principle of automaties and control that a source leads to a measurable

result depending on a distinct transfer function. For the inverse heat conduction problem this transfer
function is based on non-integer derivatives [68]. The source for the measurable signal is the net surface
heat ﬂux. The measurable signal is the temperature of an in-depth sensor. For many known problems, e.g.
semi-inﬁnite, cylindrical, spherical, the transfer function is of the following form:

L M
Z anDn/2V(t) = Z ,BnDn/2g0(t) , avec 060 :1 (19)
L020 M020
For many applications, this equation holds, too. And it turned out that only very few parameters (the order
of 5) are needed to characterize a sensor system. The parameters an and [in are identiﬁed during a
calibration step. This is realized using known heat ﬂuxes provided by diode laser systems [69, 70]. The
method is therefore based on non-integer system identiﬁcation (NISI) giving the name for this heat ﬂux
method. The following two ﬁgures show a miniaturized NISI heat ﬂux probe and a calibration
measurement.

2.2.3 Inﬂuence of Surface Catalycity 0n Heat Flux Measurements
Apart from uncontrolled heat losses, there is a far more important factor Which can considerably inﬂuence
the heat ﬂux measurement results: the surface catalycity of the sample.
The heat ﬂux on a sample in a dissociated gas (While neglecting the radiation portion) Which is not
chemically balanced consists of two parts joined together. The ﬁrst part is supplied by the normal,
molecular heat conductivity. The second forms When atom pairs recombine directly on the surface. Hence,
they release some of their recombination energy to the sample. The quantitative relationship between the
two parts, heat conductivity and recombination, depends on the duration that the recombination partners
are in the boundary layer. If the potential reaction partners need a longer time for their way to the sample
surface than the time needed for the recombination reaction, then a balanced boundary layer eXists. In this
case, the surface catalycity is not important because the particles already recombine in the ﬂow releasing
their recombination energy to the gas mixture. The surface catalycity becomes important as soon as a more
or less frozen boundary layer prevails. Then, the recombination time is much longer than the diffusion
time through the boundary layer. All potential reaction partners enter therefore the boundary layer and
reach the surface of the sample. If the nature of the surface encourages recombination (heterogeneous
catalysis), then the reaction energy Will be released directly on the surface and the heat ﬂux Will increase.
However, if the surface is not conducive to recombination, then the particles leave the boundary layer
again Without any reaction. This characteristic is quantitatively expressed by the so-called recombination
coefﬁcient of a material y. Here y: 1 means that all of the atoms impinging on the surface Will recombine

(fully catalytic behaviour), and 9/: O a non—eatalytie behaviour).
As an example, F ig. 9 depicts the results of heat ﬂux measurements that were performed With probes made
of different materials. The surface eatalyeity can increase the heat ﬂux by more than a factor of 2!
Based on the heat ﬂux difference and a characterization of the plasma to a maximum extend, boundary
layer models can then be used to derive the recombination coefﬁcient 9/. For the stagnation point situation
even algebraic models such as the boundary layer model of Goulard [15] can then be used [16]. The
characterization of the material requires however a good knowledge of other material properties such as
heat conductivity or emissivity in order to enable an adequate assessment of the heat ﬂux information at
relevant wall temperatures. This is eventually needed as the recombination itself is a strong function of the
temperature. In contrast to F ig. 9, wherein the depicted heat ﬂux was measured ealorimetrieally With cold
walls, F ig. 10 depicts results for heat ﬂuxes derived from probes equipped With a pyrometer that allow the
derivation of the heat ﬂux at relevant wall temperatures.
Clearly, the signiﬁcance of such data has to be considered carefully also if the methodology of
determining catalysis is concerned. A reVieW of relevant methodologies concludes that a data base type
assessment of the available methodologies and the respective data is needed in order to consider
systematic differences in the data [18]. With the data obtained at IRS, an inverse method was developed,
qualiﬁed and applied that makes use of the heat ﬂux differences on materials With different but known
catalytic activity in order to determine the degree of dissociation degree. This led to the development and
ﬂight qualiﬁcation of PHLUX (Pyrometrie Heat fLUX eXperiment) for the ESA capsule EXPERT [18].
Besides the proof of concept of this system a comparison With data from plasma probes, diode laser
absorption spectroscopy and laser induced ﬂuorescence was performed successfully [19].
2.2.4 Enthalpy Measurements
Two different enthalpy probes are used depending on the pressure level at IRS. In one case it is tried to
suck out the boundary layer of a high-enthalpy ﬂow and in the other case a cooling gas is injected. In
addition to this, the speciﬁc enthalpy is calculated from the heat ﬂux and total pressure measurements.

If the total pressure is high enough, then the local speciﬁc enthalpy and the local mass ﬂow rate of a
supersonic ﬂow can be determined by suctioning out mass using the probe shown in Fig. 11. The mass
ﬂow Which corresponds to the probe opening is suctioned out by a pump and the mass ﬂow rate mg and
the gas temperature T g, 2 at the end of the probe and consequently the total enthalpy of the gas can be
determined. The suction power has to be adjusted so that the compression shock Which forms in front of
the probe is perpendicular to the inlet opening so that a mass escape or additional in-ﬂow is avoided. The
amount of heat Which is carried off by the cooling water is measured With and Without suction allowing
thus to determine the amount of heat extracted from the gas ﬂow by the difference. The energy balance
reads
mghm : mWCW (TWputﬂow _ TW,inflow) |V.0pen _mWCW (TWputﬂow _ TW,ir1f 10w)|V.closed +mngTg,2 ' (20)
Thus, the unknown total enthalpy ht); can be obtained. Errors appear as soon as the speciﬁc enthalpy and
thus the suction speed are very high. Furthermore, Within low pressure conditions problems arise With a
very low mass ﬂow rate and With a certain minimum pressure difference needed for the pump.
Instead, the mass injection enthalpy probe, Which has been developed at the IRS [7, 8], can also be used
for ﬂows at low pressures. The measurement principle is based on the reduction of the heat ﬂux to the wall
due to mass injection through the surface of the probe (Fig. 12).
The surface heat transfer in a Viscous non-equilibrium high enthalpy ﬂow is for this case obtained by

Where the heat ﬂuX due to radiation is often negligible. NOW, a mass injection through the wall into the
boundary layer inﬂuences the layer and the transferred heat ﬂuX. It leads to a decrease of the temperature
gradient 0n the surface and therefore to a decrease of heat ﬂuX due to conduction. Indeed, When the
injection rate is high enough, the Viscous layer is blown completely off the surface, and the aerodynamic
convective heat transfer becomes zero. Theoretical investigations by solving the transformed Navier-
Stokes equations in the boundary layer show that the heat ﬂuX q in the stagnation point of the body is
dependent on the mass ﬂow of the cooling gas Which is emitted and can be expressed over a Wide range of
operations by

Another investigation leads to nearly identical results by solving the Viscous shock layer equations [9]. By
varying the speciﬁc mass ﬂow rate pwvw and measuring the heat ﬂux ratio cj/ go the enthalpy can be
determined from the equation system above in the following way graphically: The heat ﬂux to the probe is
measured by varying the cooling mass ﬂow rate. Then the heat ﬂux ratio cj/q'0 is plotted against the mass
addition factor B as shown in F ig. 14. Adjusting this curve to the theoretical, leads then to the unknown
enthalpy difference. F igure 14 shows the result of such a regression calculation for various positions in the
plasma stream. It is noticeable that from a mass addition factor of B z 1.2 onward a sudden deviation of
the measurements appears. Numerical simulations have shown that at this point the emission speed of the
cooling gas reaches sonic speed. Here, effects obviously appear that cannot be explained by the theory
applied. However, this is not really important for determining the speciﬁc enthalpy because the upper
portion of the curve is sufﬁcient for the regression analysis.
The local distribution of the speciﬁc enthalpy can also be determined from measurements of the local heat
ﬂux and total pressure distribution. For this purpose, F ay and Riddell [10] reformed the laminar boundary
layer equations for chemically reactive ﬂows. By comparing With experimental results, semi-empirieal
equations could be formed for the following three cases:
- boundary layer in chemical equilibrium (independent from the surface eatalyeity),
- frozen boundary layer With a fully catalytic surface,
- frozen boundary layer With a non-eatalytie surface.

2.3 Mass Spectrometry
Mass spectrometry allows in principle the determination of particle densities and energy distributions of
neutrals and ions in a free stream plasma. At IRS, it has been used to determine the plasma ﬂow
composition [20, 21] as well as to investigate the erosion behavior [22, 23] and catalytic effects [5, 24] of
typical heat protection materials.
The mass spectrometer used at the IRS is based on a VG Quadrupole [25] SXP300/CMASOO and consists
of an open electron impact ion source, a cylindrical mirror energy analyzer (CMA, O - 50 eV), a triple
ﬁlter quadrupole (O - 300 amu) and a ehanneltron (Fig. 15). An ion transfer optic (ITO) is installed in front
of the ion source, a small aperture lens, with which external ions can be focused into the CMA while the
ion source is switched off. In the case where neutrals are detected, a reﬂecting potential for positive ions is
applied to the ITO and the ion source is switched 011. Thus, mass scans at a constant energy and energy
scans at a constant mass can be carried out for neutral as well as ionized plasma particle.
As a typical result, the composition of a nitrogen plasma at a stagnation pressure of 1.3 mbar measured
with a one-stage conﬁguration is shown in Fig. 16. One-stage conﬁgurations of different shapes were also
used for the investigation of catalytic effects [24]. They allow an operation at different surface
temperatures and with different coatings of the oriﬁce region. Fig. 16 (right) shows the distribution of
nitric oxide with different coatings and conﬁgurations is shown as an example.
For measurements at higher ambient pressures, a two-staged system MS-H was designed for pressures up
to 1 kPa shown in Fig. 17. The inlet system was built with an additional pumping stage between the
tungsten oriﬁce and the spectrometer housing. With this two-stage design it was possible to increase the
oriﬁce diameter. This conﬁguration was used for catalytic investigations with different oriﬁce materials.

F ig. 18 shows exemplary results for the ratio of NO/NZ with a tungsten and an SiC oriﬁce, respectively.
Another conﬁguration was ﬁnally used to examine the erosion behavior of ceramic heat shield materials.
For this purpose, the material sample has to be arranged uneooled just in front of the oriﬁce (F ig. 19) [26,
27]. The erosion products are extracted by the same pinhole diameters as in the one stage conﬁguration.
This conﬁguration has been used for the on-line investigation of the erosion behavior of different coatings
as well as for the investigation of the passive/aetive transition of the oxidation of SiC. F ig. 20 e.g. shows
the time dependence of the ion percentage of mass 28 which represents Si and CO using a coated C/C-SiC
sample (heated up to 167OOC). After 15 s at a temperature of about l400°C, a rapid increase of the signal
can be seen. A surface temperature of 1670°C was reached after 30 seconds when the steep decrease of the
signal occursThis release of Silicon is due to the transition of the sample into the active oxidation mode
and was in a later campaign conﬁrmed using an advanced spectroscopic plasma probe.
This example illustrates also one challenge of the mass spectrometer: to distinguish between gas species
with equivalent mass. Many other are also present, beside the challenge to operate a highly sophisticated
measurement technique directly in a very harsh environment. One of the key challenges is related to
catalysis, i.e. occurring chemical (gas phase), catalytic reactions or reaction during the ionization process
may “falsify” the measurement leading subsequently to an inverse problem which should be solved in
order to obtain the interesting information. Unfortunately, this inverse problem has also several solutions.
Nevertheless, mass spectrometry is a very valuable technique for the examination of rareﬁed ﬂows, at
least for qualitative investigations.

2.4 Solid State Gas Sensors
2.4.1 Introduction
Almost two decades of research and development actiVities have been performed at Stuttgart University
and TU Dresden on the topic of measuring oxygen partial pressures for various space applications using
solid electrolyte gas sensors [28-34]. The sensors have been applied for example to measure the oxygen
amount inside the plasma wind tunnels, F igs. 2l-23 [28, 29]. In parallel, different ﬂight experiments were
performed to measure the residual oxygen partial pressure in higher altitudes onboard of ballistic sounding
rockets, which served mainly as precursor experiments for an experiment on-board the International Space
Station (“FIPEX on 188”). The latter should measure the natural and induced environment (atomic /
molecular oxygen) [28, 30, 31, 33, 34] and was installed on the outer platform EuTEF (European
Technology Exposure Facility) of the European module “Columbus” on the 188 in February 2008 [34].
During 572 days of operation, the instrument F IPEX provided the ﬁrst time resolved measurement of the
residual atomic and molecular oxygen in the higher atmosphere along the ISS orbit.
Basically, “F IPEX on 188” has been also the stimulus for the new sensor development, because
commercially available sensors did not fulﬁll the requirements for the space application. Very inspiring
was also the high interest which simultaneously arose from industry and science for a variety of terrestrial
applications, e.g. for environmental and combustion control [32, 38], medicine [39, 41, 42], and vacuum
applications [28, 34, 40]. The reasons were mainly the miniaturized design and other features of the new
sensor elements, e.g. their capability to detect different gas species like 02, H2, C0, C02, etc. Modern
production techniques and innovative materials were also introduced to allow for high quality, reliable,
and miniaturized sensor element design (F ig. 24). Another feature, which resulted from the sensor
miniaturization, is the possibility to simultaneously measure other physical properties, e.g. total ﬂow rates
and to some extent also total pressures. These characteristics made the new sensor elements even more
attractive for a variety of applications on ground and in space.
For example, for many manned space missions, and especially on the 188, there is a need for a small,
light-weight, portable, potentially body-mounted, metabolic gas analyzer with which periodic ﬁtness or
scientiﬁc evaluations on the astronauts could be performed. Hence, the development of dedicated sensor
elements was initiated which are suitable to monitor a time resolved oxygen and carbon dioxide
concentration change also under ambient pressures as needed for the human respiratory analysis for
medical and ﬁtness purposes. In parallel, the F IPEX sensors have also been adapted to measure oxygen in
vacuum and plasma applications, for example in magnetron reactive gas sputter plants for ﬂoat glass
coating [40]. Furthermore, sensors for the measurement of residual oxygen in pure hydrogen or residual

hydrogen in pure oxygen, as needed for example in fuel cell systems, were investigated. Another example
for the challenging terrestrial applications is the use of such sensors for the detection of incomplete
combustion (carbon monoxide).

In the following, a brief summary of the measurement principles, the design of the oxygen sensors and
some selected remarkable results, especially for rareﬁed ﬂows, are given. A summary for the other
applications is given in [43].

2.4.2 Measurement Principles and Sensor Development
The working principle of the sensors is based on solid state electrolysis using either a potentiometrie or an
amperometrie measurement principle With different electrolytes and electrode materials. Sensitivity and
selectivity of the sensors are mainly controlled by geometry, materials, and the manufacturing strategy of
the sensitive parts, i.e. screen printing processes that inﬂuence the performance of the electrodes and the
electrolyte. The sensors are manufactured by screen printing and subsequent sintering of several metallic
and ceramic layers on a ceramic substrate. The screen printing technique allows for reproducible, large
series of low-eost sensor elements. F ig. 25 shows the design of the multi-layer sensor elements in
principle, comprising for example a diffusion layer, sensitive layers, inner and outer electrodes, solid state
electrolyte (ionic conductors), an alumina insulator acting as carrier substrate, a heater to control the
temperature and a resistance temperature sensor that is separated by an isolation layer.
Of course, the sensor signal depends also on the working temperature in a relatively complex manner, e.g.
by the temperature dependencies of the adsorption and desorption processes on the electrodes, the ionic
conductivity of the electrolyte, and by several other occurring physical phenomena that are relevant for the
sensor signal. Thus, the heater design itself is optimized to obtain a uniform temperature distribution and
to induce only a minimum thermal stress on the sensor element.
The development of the sensors is an iterative and hardly predictable process because minimal changes in
each layer composition and/or sintering procedure may lead to very different results. Therefore, hundreds
of sensor conﬁgurations have been designed, manufactured, and analyzed. This optimization process
resulted in a remarkable improvement of the sensitivity and stability of the measurement, leading to
almost ideal characteristics. Different tests demonstrated the good sensitivity e.g. to oxygen and the
exceptionally fast response to oxygen changes.
For the oxygen sensors, yttria-doped zirconia (YSZ) is used as electrolyte, the electrochemical properties
of Which have been studied already since the last century When Nemst investigated its ionic conductivity
[36]. YSZ selectively conducts oxygen ions at higher temperatures (above about 450°C) and the sensor
has therefore to be heated up to a constant working temperature. An ideal electrochemical cell, as sketched
in F ig. 26, leads then to an Electro Motive F oree generated across the solid electrolyte caused by oxygen
concentration differences. This leads to a potential difference to be measured as sensor voltage Us between
the electrodes in the so called potentiometric measurementprinciple:

p02,meas the OZ pressure in the measurement Chamber. The offset voltage U0 originates from a temperature
difference AT between the two electrodes, e.g. due to forced convection, insufﬁcient heating, asymmetric
sensor geometry and/or catalytic combustion at one electrode. The need of a hermetically sealed reference
Chamber With constant p02,ref makes Clear that the potentiometric measurement principle, as used for
example for different commercially available k-probes, is not very well suited for the use in the harsh
environment in space. Hence, the amperometric principle With reference electrodes has been Chosen for
the further oxygen sensor development. The amperometric principle makes also a ﬂat sensor design and
the fabrication by thick ﬁlm technologies possible. As a side effect, a miniaturization in scale, mass, and
power demand is achievable.
In the amperometric principle and ﬂat design, the oxygen concentration is then determined by measuring
the current that is conducted through the electrolyte at a constant applied voltage (Fig. 27). Here, the
measured current [W is directly related to the number of oxygen ions conducted through the electrolyte.
Consequently, if a diffusion barrier limits the oxygen ﬂux from the ambient air to the cathode, the
resulting electrical current depends linearly on the ambient oxygen concentration cenvimnmem (every oxygen
at the cathode is transported through the electrolyte; the oxygen concentration at the cathode

additional layers above the electrolyte assist in adjusting the required porosity. Diffusion layers With a low
diffusion constant are then needed under low pressure conditions because the Oz molecule ﬂuX is naturally
limited by effusion. The resulting sensor current is very low (nano- to some mioroampere) caused by the
naturally very low oxygen concentration. Also, in order to control occurring overpotentials at the cathode,
an additional reference electrode is used and the resulting three electrode conﬁguration leads to the
required low response times and sensor signal stability, especially at very low Oz partial pressures.
The oxygen sensor measurement range and the maximum detectable oxygen partial pressure can be
adapted by adjusting the overall porosity of the diffusion layers, the active electrode areas, and the number
of adsorption places for the oxygen molecules at the electrodes that allow for an electron transfer reaction.
Fig. 28 illustrates the ranges for different sensor designs - the left part depicting the remarkable Wide range
of detectable oxygen partial pressure, the right part showing the Characteristics of a full range oxygen
partial pressure sensor as developed for medical and environmental applications under ambient pressure

2.4.3 Space Experiment FIPEX on ISS
Space vehicles in low altitudes, orbit the Earth With a velocity of about 8 km/s in a highly rareﬁed
atmosphere. Above the mesopause (from about 85 km) the molecular oxygen is dissociated because of the
solar radiation in the UV-regime. Subsequently, atomic oxygen dominates above this altitude up to about
1000 km compared to oxygen and nitrogen molecules. Because drag of space vehicles in low Earth orbit is
mainly inﬂuenced by the density of the ﬂow, it is important to know the conditions on hand relatively
exact. However, because the atmosphere’s composition is inﬂuenced by the solar radiation and the Earth’s
magnetic and gravitational ﬁeld, the exact constitution at a given point depends upon many different
parameters, Which include long-term, short-term and spatial variations. Many different semi-empirioal
models were developed in the past With Which it is possible to calculate the data for any spatial position at
a given time. However, the results of these models may differ by more than one order of magnitude. Thus,
the prediction of total density and gas partial pressures for satellites and the International Space Station
ﬂying at these altitudes is insufﬁcient.
Especially the ﬂuX of atomic oxygen is of general importance as it shows different interactions With
spacecraft surfaces, e.g. erosion of the surface material. With the FIPEX mioro-sensor experiment the
atomic oxygen in the surrounding of the International Space Station was measured. FIPEX sensors are
able to distinguish and measure molecular and atomic oxygen at very low ambient pressures (Fig. 28 (left)
shows sensor Characteristics for molecular and Fig. 29 for atomic oxygen). The behaviour of the sensor is
manipulated by using different electrode materials, i.e. if the cathode is made of a material With negligible
dissociative absorption of molecular oxygen, only atomic oxygen can be detected. The main objectives of

FIPEX have been in summary:

- Time resolved measurement of atomic oxygen ﬂux in low Earth orbit over a long period of time.

- Veriﬁcation of atmosphere models.

- Investigation of the Space Station contamination in thrusting periods and during proximity
operations of the logistic vehicles. This experiment can give a time resolved determination of the
contamination of satellite structures in space.

- Investigation of the behaviour of the ceramic solid electrolyte and the different electrode coatings
during exposure to the space environment.

The FIPEX ﬂight experiment consists of three separate parts, two Sensor-units and one Electronics-box.
The two Sensor-units contain 6 sensors each and are mounted onto the Electronics-box, one into RAM
(ﬂight) direction measuring the dynamic pressure and one into ZENITH direction measuring the static
pressure of the atomic and molecular oxygen. The main electronic box houses the sensor control, the
experiment command and data handling, the power control and the thermal control system. The complete
space qualiﬁcation of the experiment according to ECSS-standards had been conducted at the TU Dresden
With high involvement of students. FIPEX was launched on STS-122 (1E) Shuttle ﬂight on 7 February
2008 and was mounted on the COLUMBUS external payload facility EuTEF having a free ﬁeld of View
into ﬂight and zenith direction of the International Space Station (Fig. 30). During the 572 days FIPEX

operation in orbit, the experiment was directly commanded and scientiﬁc data was obtained by the FIPEX
User Home Base at the TU Dresden, Germany.
First results of the sensor currents versus the prediction of atomic oxygen using the atmosphere models are
illustrated in Fig. 31. These ﬁrst results show deviations of the transient behavior of AO compared to the
prediction of the higher atmosphere models NRLMSISE, MET and DTM (NRLMSISE is an empirical
model of the temperatures and the densities of the atmosphere’s components: US Naval Research Labora-
tory Mass Spectrometer and Incoherent Scatter Radar Exosphere, MET: Marshall Engineering Thermo-
sphere Model, DTM: Density Temperature Drag Model). The results show an increase of AO after local
sunrise When ISS orbits from south to the equator followed by a decrease When continuing the orbit to
higher latitudes. Some minutes before the ISS eXits the local eclipse phase, the AO level reaches its
minimum.
FIPEX on ISS provided the ﬁrst long time and time resolved measurements of atomic oxygen along the
ISS orbit. Exact results Will be published after processing of all data and the sensor post calibration. The
time resolved data can be used to correlate the models of the higher atmosphere and to improve the
prediction of the atomic oxygen ﬂux during a space mission, hence the erosion of the surface materials.

2.4.4 Terrestrial Vacuum Applications
Glass is the major cause of heating and cooling losses of buildings. 30% of all heat losses are due to old
glass. Coated heat protection glass reduces heat losses by about 60% compared to unooated isolation glass.
The energy saving potential is 20 liters of heating oil corresponding to 50 kg carbon dioxide per year per
square meter glass. A uniform color and reliable heat protection requires homogeneous coating and high
production line reproducibility. Based on FIPEX, the VacuSen sensor was further developed for vacuum
and plasma technology application. Its purpose is to provide an easy, low cost, time resolved in-situ
process control e.g. directly in a magnetron reactive gas sputter plant for ﬂoat glass coating. The goals are
to measure the total or oxygen partial pressures, to optimize the coating process and to enhance the quality
of the coating using the robust solid electrolyte gas sensor technology.
The design of the VacuSen sensor is straight forward for simplicity in function, small size and projected
low cost. The geometry is 20X3.5X0.5mm, resulting in a reduced heater power of around 2W at 660°C.
Commercially available oxygen partial pressure measurement devices are ﬂange mounted, because they
need direct contact to the outer “reference” atmosphere. Due to the space driven miniaturization and the
referenoe-free measurement principle, VacuSen can also be mounted freely inside a vacuum Chamber,
exactly Where the process takes place and the relevant parameters have to be monitored. This is
advantageous, especially for application in a reactive gas magnetron sputter plant Where the typical
dimensions of ﬂoat glass are up to 6X3.5m. During the coating process, the glass passes through different
sputter Chambers, each of them separately controlled With Argon and Oxygen as reactive gas. In order to
guarantee equal reaction process conditions in each Chamber along the length and Width of the ﬂoat glass
and hence, a uniform coating quality, several VacuSen sensors can be positioned directly inside the
Chambers for continuous in-situ process control and optimization. The nominal operation point for the
coating plant is at a total pressure of around 1-10'3 mbar.
The Characteristics of 20 VacuSen-systems around this working point are shown in Fig. 32. The
measurement range is at total pressures of 1-10'5 - l-lO'2 mbar, corresponding to oxygen partial pressure
of about 2' 10'6 - 2° 10'3 mbar. A linear Characteristics in double logarithmic scale follows Isens=b-pt0t m (Isens
in HA, pot in mbar) With a constant slope of around m=0.8i0.05 and a sensor speciﬁc y-aXis intercept b. b
can be obtained by an easy one-point calibration routine around the nominal operation point.

2.5 Electrostatic Probes
Electrostatic probes normally used in plasma Wind tunnels and for the investigation of electrical thrusters
consist of up to three electrodes Which are electrically insulated from each other and from mass and are
eXposed to the plasma. By recording ourrent-voltage Characteristics or ourrent-time developments, the
various parameters of the plasma such as plasma potential, electron temperature and density, ﬂow
direction, electron energy function, plasma velocity or ion temperature can be determined at the position
of the probe electrodes [4, 44].
If one moves an electrostatic probe into a plasma beam, a plasma boundary layer forms around the probe.
This layer can be altered by varying the bias voltage across the probe. Important plasma parameters can be
deduced from the probe signal. For this purpose, the boundary layer must be described theoretically.
When moving a probe into a plasma assumed to be quasi-neutral, a negative Charge of the probe takes
place across from the surrounding plasma. This is because the higher thermal moveability of the electrons
causes more electrons than ions to reach the probe electrode surface. The negative Charge causes a
repulsion of further electrons in the area around the probe. Therefore, a positive space Charge layer forms
Which disturbs the ionization-reoombination equilibrium. The higher ion density in the space Charge layer
around the probe, compared to the electron density, causes the formation of an electric ﬁeld Which de-
creases as the distance to the probe surface increases.
As a result of the reoombinations on the probe surface, Charge carriers from the quasi-neutral, undisturbed
plasma have to subsequently be delivered to the space Charge layer. This Charge carrier drift requires the
existence of a weak remaining ﬁeld Which must also be present outside of the space Charge layer in the so-
oalled transition region. Fig. 32 shows the development of the potential in the entire plasma surface layer.
The thickness of the space Charge layer is given by the Debye length 1D Which is dependent on the
electron temperature and density by means of the equation
6'0 kT
AD: Iz—e . (29)
6 n6
Fig. 33 shows that, for example, in MPD tunnels the Debye length is several mm. In the adj aoent transition
region, a slight Charge carrier concentration decline still eXists Which affects the drift. Despite the small,
remaining electric ﬁeld in the transition region, the plasma can be considered as quasi-neutral for the
theoretical treatment. For additional increasing distances from the probe surface, the undisturbed, quasi-
neutral plasma With the potential VPL is ﬁnally reached. The border of the space Charge layer is determined
by the so-oalled Bohm criteria according to Which the Charge carriers entering the space Charge layer have

The current ﬂowing to a probe’s surface depends on the mean free path Zel- of the charge carrier and the
Debye length 1D in the space charge layer and on the probe radius r. The relationships between these
parameters determine Whether the movement of the charge carriers in the space charge layer is inﬂuenced
by a shock. If the probe radius can be chosen so that
,161. >> r >> AD (33)
is fulﬁlled, then a so-ealled conventional shoekless thin space charge layer can be assumed.
In an MPD tunnel partial densities of the charged particles in the investigated regions of the air plasma
ﬂow, ranging from x=50 mm to 500 mm aXial distance to the MPG, are in the range of ne=1017 to 1021 m'3.
With electron temperatures T e of 5000 to 30000 K, this results in Debye lengths of 1D < 40 pm. The
Coulomb mean free paths are in the range of Zel- Z 1 mm.
The shoekless theories developed for stationary plasmas and cylindrical probes can also be applied to
ﬂowing, shoekless plasmas When the cylindrical probes With a length l are aligned With the plasma ﬂow
and [MD >> 1 is fulﬁlled. In the ease of larger Debye lengths the plasma layer is enlarged at the front
surface of the probe. And the ion current to this surface compared With the ion current to the cylindrical
surface of the length I can no longer be neglected. The ratio [MD is proportional to the so-ealled end effect
parameter 27 Which is a criterion for the portion of current to the front surface of a cylindrical probe
aligned With the plasma ﬂow. For T; > 50 this amount of current is negligible.

2.6 In-Situ Radiometer
Radiometer probes are mainly used to determine the radiation heat ﬂuX. By using appropriate ﬁlters,
however, conclusions about the gas composition can also be made. The radiation intensity of the plasma
rises With the fourth power of the gas temperature When only the continuum part of the plasma radiation is
taken into account. The following relation is approximately valid for the radiation heat ﬂuX, Whereby the
degree of emission of the plasma can be smaller than that of the thermal protection material depending on
the plasma condition:
' ~ 8 T 4 — 8 T 4 (34)
qradiation plasma plasma wall wall
At plasma temperatures of 10000 K and higher and at pressures of up to 100 mbar, the radiation heat ﬂuX
can generally no longer be neglected and reaches the same order of magnitude as the convective part. Fig.
35 (left) shows, for example, calculated heat ﬂuxes for the entry of the Huygens probe into the atmosphere
of the Saturn moon Titan.
In ground test facilities a detector can be placed perpendicular to the plasma beam or to the shock front to
measure the radiation heat ﬂuxes. The measurement devices are then located outside of the evacuated test
chamber and the optics are focused on the test point through Windows or light wave conductors. This
stipulates long distances to the measurement position along Which radiation can be absorbed and the
measurable wave length region remains limited to the transmission area of the Windows or the light wave
conductors.
The more direct way is to place the radiometer in a probe Which is directly exposed to the plasma. For this
purpose a radiometer probe, shown in Fig. 35 (right), was developed at the IRS. Various glass shields,
ﬁlters and detectors can still be used as indicated. However, they limit the usable spectral region. The goal,
however, of radiometric measurements is to cover the entire radiation Which appears. But the detectors
may not touch the plasma because they can be damaged by the heat. This can be avoided by mounting the
detector deep inside the cooled probe body. The radiation reaches the detector through an optical tunnel.
Here a cold, stationary gas column forms because the detector completely closes off the end of the tunnel.
However, this method clearly narrows the Visible solid angle. In order to get the entire radiation on the
front side of the sample, the probe has to be rotated in the beam While being measured so that the complete
solid angle is covered. A hemispherical numerical integration results then in the demanded radiation heat
ﬂux at the front opening of the radiometer [45].
The detector and Where applicable the ﬁlters and lenses must be suited to the task. Special attention must
be paid to the choice of the detector. After that the most important characteristics are compiled.

The signal-noise ratio and the noise equivalent power (NEP) are used to assess and compare detectors. The
signal-noise ratio is the ratio between the output signal of a detector and the superordinated noise. It
describes the maximum possible exactness of a measurement. With a signal-noise ratio of 100:1, the
exactness of the measurement can in no case be better than 1 %.
In a radiometric detector the NEP indicates the radiation power Which has to reach the detector in order to
create a signal-noise ratio of l. NEP is also the smallest measurable power Which reaches the detector. The
following applies:

Il’l

NEP = — (35)

S
Here In is the noise voltage or the noise current of the detector and S is the total sensitivity. Because S
depends on the relative spectral intensity distribution of the radiation source, When comparing various
NEP values it must be taken into account that they were recorded With the same radiation source under the
same conditions. Usually a black radiator With a temperature of 500 K is used.
Additional important characteristics are:

- Linearity: The linearity is one of the most important speciﬁcations of a detector for radiometric
measurements. Linearity eXists When in a certain range the output signal of a detector is exactly
proportional to the incoming radiation or When the sensitivity of the detector does not depend on
the incoming power.

- Time constant The time constant 1: of a detector reports the time that the detector signal requires
to reach 63% 0f the ﬁnal value after constant radiated power suddenly appears on the detector.

- Total sensitivity of a detector The total sensitivity of a detector is the ratio between the detector
output signal I and the total incoming radiated power CD in a certain wavelength region. It is a
function of the detector, the radiation source and the transmission from Windows and ﬁlters on the
optical axis of the measurement arrangement. A certain detector has a different total sensitivity for
each radiation source.

If in addition the measurement arrangement is divided by the Visible solid angle, one obtains the radiation
heat ﬂux in [W/(mzsr)].
Fig. 36 shows several proﬁles of the radiation heat ﬂux perpendicular to the beam aXis at various NZ/CH4
plasma combinations used to simulate the entry of the Huygens probe into Titan’s atmosphere. The
measurement shows the signiﬁcance of plasma radiation in the VUV Which, by an assessment of other
scientiﬁc works referenced in [45], could be assigned to nitrogen molecular transitions and atomic lines.
Post ﬂight analyses performed at IRS e.g. for FIREII could approve the signiﬁcance of this spectral
radiation for hyperbolic re-entries as this radiation contributes a signiﬁcant fraction of the integral
radiative heat ﬂux (up to 90 %). The respective results are currently under further investigation and Will be
published in a future work.

3.0 NON-INTRUSIVE MEASUREMENT TECHNIQUES
3.1 Introduction
3.1.1 General Remarks
Non-intrusive measurement techniques intend to determine ﬂow properties from the analysis of light that
is either emitted or absorbed. The physical principle to be used is based on the fact that every species can
absorb or emit light at characteristic wavelengths depending on the electron conﬁguration and the
thermodynamic state of the species, because every species has characteristic discrete, quantized energy
levels. Optical non-intrusive techniques have been used for many years and are state of the art particularly
in combustion process diagnostics [48].
From a historical point of View, there have been three maj or problems at the beginning of the last century
(around 1900). After the invention of the electron (found by Thomson in 1897), there were basically three
physical observations not understood: the continuum radiation curve (the so-ealled ultraviolet
eatastrophy), the mystery of the photo effect (the photo current depends on wavelength and not on light
intensity), and the discrete absorption and emission lines of ﬂames and sunlight (Bunsen and Kirchhoff
observed a ﬂame With a spectrometer). It was only after the idea of Planck that energy is transferred in
discrete quantums Which allowed explaining all three observed phenomena [47].
Nowadays, quantum mechanics is a Wide ﬁeld in theoretical and experimental physics and engineers use
these basic principles in order to understand rareﬁed gas ﬂows non-intrusively, i.e. Without disturbing the
macroscopic characteristics of the ﬂow.
Although not particularly useful for rareﬁed gas ﬂows, pyrometry is somewhat the very ﬁrst measurement
technique. It means the integral measurement of electromagnetic light intensity emitted by a gas ﬂow or a
hot surface. It is based on the pure continuum radiation detection. If the radiation is recorded as a function
of the wavelength, the diagnostic is named optical emission spectroscopy. Atoms and molecules have
discrete, quantized energy levels. For atoms, these energy levels are only electronic (based on the electron
conﬁguration around its nucleus), While molecules have additionally rotational and Vibrational energy
levels. If certain selection criteria are met - Which is a result of quantum mechanical considerations —
atoms and molecules can undergo a transition ongoing With the emission of light at a certain wavelength.
The observed transition line has a characteristic line form depending on the thermodynamic state of the
gas species. From an analysis of the rotational, Vibrational and electronic emission lines of a species, the
thermodynamic state of the gas can be identiﬁed and qualitative information about the composition of the
gas can be drawn. If an emission line can be resolved With a high resolution using interferometry,
temperatures and even ﬂow velocity can be measured. At IRS, Fabry-Perot interferometry is applied.
Again a more complex optical diagnostic technique became useful With the invention of lasers. Laser light,
Which is tuned to wavelengths such that the species of interest interacts With it, results either in scattering
or absorption of the laser light energy. Since this lecture focuses on rareﬁed gas ﬂows, only measurement
techniques that are applicable to this low pressure regime are discussed. The effective cross sections of
scattering processes are relatively small and therefore not applicable to low pressure ﬂows.
Since all of the non-intrusive optical diagnostic techniques are derived from the same physical principles,
the mathematical background is summarized ﬁrst. Then, every measurement technique is discussed
separately.
3.1.2 Plasma state
For plasma ﬂow diagnostic, the plasma state and its deﬁnition are of basic importance. The state of
complete thermodynamic equilibrium means each elementary process (e.g. ionization) is in equilibrium
With its complementary (in this case recombination). The numbers of both processes per unit time are

equal. The most important properties of plasma in complete thermodynamic equilibrium are:

° The spectral distribution of the emitted radiation is that of a black body radiator and follows
Planck’s Law.

° The velocities of all particles follow Maxwell ’5 distribution function With a common temperature
T

f(v)=——=—v2 — eXp —— (39)
N dv J; 2kT 2kT
V is the velocity value, m the particle mass and N the number of particles per volume unit.
- The ratio of the number of particles in an excited state 11m and the number of all particles of the
regarded species ni is given by a Boltzmann-distribution. For this case, the Boltzmann equation
_ = 33—” exp _ _ (40)
""i g 1,0 kT
is valid. The quantities gm and go are the statistic weights of the different excitation levels of the
regarded ionization stage. They are always integers and can be derived from quantum mechanical
laws or taken from spectroscopic tables. Em is the energy of the excited state n.
- The chemical equilibrium Which is also a part of the complete thermodynamic equilibrium is
deﬁned by the law ofmass action. A reaction A + B :> C is described by:
n n
A : [(0‘) (41)
”C
Here, m, m; and nC are the concentrations of the reacting components and K is the velocity
constant of the particular reaction. K is a function of the temperature and has to be determined
experimentally.

' The last important requirement is a relation for the ionization-reeombination equilibrium Which is
given by the Saha-Eggert equation Which is in fact the law of mass action for the ionization
reaction. Limiting the possible ionization stages to 1 yields for the degree of ionization a for an
atomic gas:

2 1 Ei
a 27zm 2 2 ——
—2 =—( 3) (kT)2e H (42)
l — 05 pk
Here, E 1' means the energy of ionization and p is the pressure of the plasma.
In a real plasma there are always differences from complete thermodynamic equilibrium. If those
differences are moderate and limited to single processes, the plasma state can often be described as close
to equilibrium. There are several possibilities to access the parameters of those plasma states but the most
important one is probably the LTG-model (local thermal equilibrium). In this case, all properties of the
complete thermodynamic equilibrium, With the exception of the requirement of a Planck distribution for
the radiation, remain valid.
If we regard the energy equations, the inﬂuence of this difference on the particle densities can be
neglected if the important processes such as excitation and heat transfer processes are dominated by
collisions and not by radiation. For this reason a sufﬁcient particle density of colliding particles is
necessary. Due to their higher mobility in comparison to that of the heavy particles, electron number
density is the important quantity. The electron number density required for LTG depends on the
temperature and the excitation state up to Which the LTG should be valid. Additionally, the highest

ionization stage that is regarded is important. For example, a typical minimum electron density for LTG
for argon up to complete single ionization and at a temperature of T = ZOOOOK is given by r16 = 4-1017em'3.
Regarding extremely rariﬁed plasma states, not even LTG can be expected in every region of the j et and
the plasma is in thermal and thermodynamic non-equilibrium. Here, thermal non-equilibrium means that
the temperatures of the electrons and the heavy particles are different and that the molecules have different
values for rotational, Vibrational and electronic temperatures.
Even in these non-equilibrium eases, the Boltzmann distribution for the rotational and Vibrational energy
can be valid With the corresponding temperature T m or T W-b as the determining parameter for the
distribution function. In thermodynamic non-equilibrium, the chemical composition of the plasma does
not correspond to the equilibrium composition because the changes in temperature are often so fast that
the chemical reactions cannot follow.
Depending on the plasma state, non-intrusive diagnostics can be applied to detect and characterize the
plasma state. The quantities as e.g. the rotational or Vibrational temperatures of a plasma molecule, cannot
be accessed With probe measurements, because the plasma state would be changed by the probe.
Therefore, non-intrusive diagnostics are an enormous asset for the characterization of plasma ﬂows
particularly at low pressures.
3.2 Theoretical Basics
In gases and plasmas at low pressures Which are excited to emit light, the emission is mainly caused by
single atoms and molecules. Thus, the properties of the emitted radiation allow conclusions to be drawn
about the emitting particles. In this case, radiation occurs mainly at single discrete wavelengths - the so-
called spectral lines. The number of lines for molecules of one species normally outnumbers the number of
lines caused by a certain atom. The resulting intensity distribution as a function of the wavelength is called
emission spectrum. There are several possibilities to excite atoms and molecules to emit radiation:

- In ﬂames, light arcs and sparks, the atoms are excited by collisions due to their high thermal

energy.
- In discharges, the excitation is caused by collisions With electrons and ions Which possess high
kinetic energy due to acceleration processes Within an electric ﬁeld.

- Excitation induced by radiation at short wavelengths such as UV or Rontgen-radiation.
Since a plasma jet of a plasma thruster is already excited, emission spectroscopic methods are rather easily
applicable. However, beginning in the order as stated in the general remarks, one has to consider ﬁrst the
origin of electromagnetic radiation. And this is rather simple: Each body With a surface temperature above
0 K emits electromagnetic radiation. Measurement instruments that determine the surface temperature
from this thermal radiation are called radiation thermometers or pyrometers. The observed wavelength
region reaches from 10'7 to 10'5 m, Which also covers the narrow region of Visible light.
The basic quantities are the radiant energyﬂux ¢ given by the emitted energy d W during the time dt

observed, the spectral radiant exitance has to be reduced according to the spectral emissivity 0f the
observed surface. The above mentioned radiation laws already show the main problems of radiation
thermometry:
- According to the Stefan Boltzmann law, the thermally emitted radiation remarkably decreases
(proportional to T4) With decreasing temperature.
- At low temperatures, the maximum of radiation is shifted to high wavelengths Where disturbing
inﬂuences on the measurement become high.
- The spectral emissivity of non black bodies depends not only on temperature and wavelength but
also on the material itself.
- Besides the radiation emitted by the observed surface, disturbing radiation of reﬂected or
transmitted radiation emitted by other radiators can inﬂuence the measurement.
If radiation interacts With a surface, reﬂection, absorption and transmission occur. The ratios of absorbed,

They are functions of the wavelength and depend on the material, its surface structure and the temperature.
They are coupled by the relation
a+r+p=1, a(ﬂ.)+r(ﬂ.)+p(ﬂ.)=1 (49)
Additionally, according to Kirchhoﬁ”, the emissivity is equal to the absorptanee for all bodies:
g(T,/l) = a(TJt) (50)
A black body Will absorb all incoming radiation and has therefore an absorptanee and due to this equation
also an emissivity of 1. If one changes from the observation of a solid to a gas ensemble, i.e. going into
more detail than the Planck curve (Fig.37), the problem of the discrete quantized energy level of the
emitting or absorbing atom has to be considered. This is What Planck proposed in the famous formula
(44). The following paragraph explains the microscopic View of the atom and molecule radiation.
3.2.1 Discrete Energy Levels of Atoms
This section gives an overview of the basic processes for the excitation of atoms [47, 46]. The emission
and absorption at single lines is explained by the model of Bohr, Who found that atoms can only eXist at
discrete energy values Which correspond to special orbits of the electrons around the positively charged
nucleus (see F ig. 38). Although his model is — from a pure physical standpoint — not correct, it is sufﬁcient
for experimenters to understand and model the problems occurring in plasma ﬂows. The basic principle is,
that Energy can be absorbed or emitted if an electron changes its orbit from one energy level to another
one. In this case the energy
hc
E = h V = — 51
nm ﬂ. ( )
is either absorbed or emitted in form of electromagnetic waves of the frequency v Which is equivalent to
the wavelength 7». Here, h is Planck’s constant and c the speed of light in the observed medium. Only
transitions between allowed energy values are possible. The allowed energy values are called energy
levels and are characterized by the indices n and m in the above equation. This means an atom can only
absorb radiation if it passes the transition from the energy level Em to the higher energetic level En Where
its electron is at a higher energetic orbit (see F ig. 38). On the other hand, an atom at the state En emits
radiation if its electron falls down to a lower energetic orbit With the energy Em (see F ig. 38).
The time during Which the electrons stay in the higher energetic state is limited to the life-time of the
excited state Which is characteristic for each excited state. This time, Which is equivalent to the time
between absorption and emission, is normally very short, in the range of nanoseconds and below.
The amount of radiation occurring during a transition is deﬁned by an emission coefﬁcient 8V Which is
deﬁned as the energy of the radiation per time and solid angle emitted at the frequency v by a unity
volume. For a spontaneous transition of an excited electron at an energy level n to a lower level m, the
emission coefﬁcient am can be calculated as:

Here, Am is the Einstein transition probability between the excited states m and n While nn is the number
density of the particles in the excited state n. The Einstein probability can be understood as the probability
that a transition Will occur. According to equation (50), the transition from the energy level n to a lower
level m produces emission of the frequency v. In reality, the emission occurs Within a frequency interval
5v. This phenomenon is called line broadening. Therefore, the emission coefﬁcient gm of a spectral line
With the linewidth 8V has to be written as:
V+5V
gm 2 Javdv (53)
V
The different broadening mechanisms Will be described in a following section.
Kirchhoﬂ and Bunsen, Who laid the foundation for spectral analysis, realized that each element emits its
own characteristic spectrum. The spectral lines of one species can be sorted into series and are described
formally by a so-ealled series formula. In the simplest case of the hydrogen atom With only one electron,
each spectral line fulﬁlls the equation:
1 1 1
— 2 RH —2 — —2 . (54)

Here, RH is the so-ealled Rydberg-constant (RH: 27:2 mee4/(h3c) = 109677,581 em'l), Where the indeX H
stands for hydrogen. n; and n 2 are integer numbers and represent the numbering of the energy levels where
n; < n 2 and n1 is constant Within one series.
The emission spectrum of hydrogen consists of the following series (named after the scientist Who found
these lines (experimentally!)):

Pfund-Series n1 = 5 n2 2 6
F ig. 38 explains the origin of the different series. Normal hydrogen, Where all atoms are at the ground
level (n=l), can absorb radiation only in the Lyman-series. The absorption at other spectral lines requires
the existence of excited states Which means that atoms eXist Where the electron already stays in the levels
n1=20rn1=3 andso on.
With rising n 2 the spectral distance between lines of one series decreases more and more. For n 2 —> 00 the
borders of the series are given by:
n2
100 = —1 (55)
RH

Beyond this border, the spectrum is no longer characterized by single emission lines but by continuous
emission. The radiation is now no longer caused by transitions of excited atoms. It originates When free
electrons are captured by ions (radiation by recombination) or When ions or electrons are accelerated or
deeelerated by electric ﬁelds. The line emission is also called bound-bound radiation While radiation by
recombination is called free-bound. Radiation caused by acceleration and deceleration processes is termed
free-free. For atoms other than hydrogen the formulation of analytic series formulas that cover all possible
spectral lines becomes rather complicated due to the fact that more than one electron eXists. The
transitions occurring in the more complex atoms are all based only on the outer electrons. All ﬁlled
subshells do not contribute to the deﬁnition of transitions.
3.2.2 Energy Levels of Molecules
Additionally to the electronic transitions of atoms, molecules have the two degrees of freedom of rotation
and Vibration. Still, the emission occurs at discrete energies Which results in an emission spectrum
consisting of single spectral lines. But in comparison to the atoms, the number of transitions allowed is
much higher and the spectral distance between the single lines is much smaller. A measurement of single
lines is only possible With extremely high resolution spectrometers. The wavelength of each emission line
is not only a function of the upper and lower electronic states of the transition but also of the upper and
lower rotational and Vibrational energy levels. In molecular spectroscopy usually the wave number v
Which is the inverse wavelength is used to characterize the single emission lines. The corresponding wave
number for a molecular transition is proportional to the total change in energy:

N 1

v = — (AEeZ + AEvib + AEW) (56)

he
Here, AEeg, AEW and AEW-b are the changes in electronic, rotational and Vibrational energy, respectively.
Obviously, the more numbers of atoms the molecule has the more rotational and Vibrational states are
possible. For rariﬁed ﬂow diagnostics With high enthalpies, larger molecules are dissociated rather quickly
and therefore the observation of molecules With more than two nuclei is seldom. In the following, only
two atomic molecules are considered.

The effect of the electronic transition can still be reduced to the corresponding energy difference of the
upper and lower electronic state and is usually taken from literature. The degrees of freedom for rotation
and Vibration can be described by analytical models Which allow the calculation of the possible energy
levels and the quantum physical interpretation of the obtained spectra.
Rotational Energy Levels
Fig. 40 shows a simple model for a tWO-atomie molecule Which is simulated as a dumb-bell. Here, the
atoms are regarded as point masses m1 and m 2, the connection With the length r0 is regarded as boundless,
massless and rigid in a ﬁrst approach. The molecule rotates around the center of mass S. In this system, the
rotational energy can be calculated using the equations of classical mechanics:
1 , 2
EM 2 — ja) (57)

Here, j is the moment of inertia and co the angular velocity of the rotation. For the simple model of the
rigid rotation, j becomes:
. 2 2
J=m1V1 +m2r2 (58)
The assumption that m1 = m 2 = m and therefore r1 = r2 Which is actually valid for homonuelear molecules
results in:
. m 2
= — r (5 9)
J 2 0
Equations of classical mechanics would say that the rotational energy can have any value. But again, in
quantum mechanics only discrete energy levels eXist and the fundamental description is based on the so-
ealled Schrb’dinger equation. For the rotation this yields:

With J = O, 1, 2,
As already mentioned, h is Planck’s constant While J is the rotational quantum number. In molecular
spectroscopy, the energy terms are usually given in terms of wave numbers Which is done by
normalization by he. Therefore, the latter equation is equivalent to:

The rotational constant Be is one of the most important constants in molecular spectroscopy. It is inversely
proportional to the moment of inertia j and gives for a known atomic mass the bonding length of the
molecule Which is a fundamental variable of the inner construction of the investigated molecule. The
selection rules of quantum mechanics only allow transitions With neighboring rotational quantum numbers
Which means the maximum change in J can be 1 0r -1. The resulting series of emission lines are called
branches and are named P-, Q- and R-braneh. The possible changes in rotational energy become:

872 ]
Q-braneh (AJ=O) AEW = 0 (63)
hZ
R-braneh (AJ=-1) AEW = —72J (64)
87: ]
If the change in the total angle remains constant Within the transition, the Q-braneh is not allowed. The
contribution of the rotational transition to the wave number of the emission line is given by:
N AE
th = AF(J) 2 —’”0t J = 0,1,2,... (65)
kc
In the model of the rigid rotating dumb-bell, the wave numbers Within one branch increase linearly With a
rising quantum number. This results in constant spectral differences between the single rotational lines in
terms of wave numbers. In reality, the connection between the two nuclei is not rigid as assumed Within
the above equations. This yields a deformation of the molecule With rising centrifugal force Which can be
taken into consideration by implementing a second order correction term yielding the model of a non-rigid
rotating dumb-bell. Here, the constant D6 is implemented Which considers the extension of the distance
between the nuclei With increasing rotational energy. D6 is an experimentally determined constant Which
varies for different species and for different electronic states. Equation (60) transforms into:
F(J) = BeJ(J + 1) — De [J(J +1)]2 . (66)
For most experimental considerations of rareﬁed ﬂows, the constants needed in the above expressions are
accurately known. A large database can be found at NIST (National Institute of Standards and
Technology).
Vibrational Energy Levels
In addition to the rotation around the center of mass, a vibration of both atoms along the molecular aXis is
possible. In the most simple way, this Vibration can be described as the motion of a reduced mass it around
an equilibrium position r0 With Ar = r - r0. The reduced mass is deﬁned as

the Schrodinger equation, applied on the harmonic oscillator yields again quantized Vibrational energies.
The Vibrational energy term becomes:

Evib (U) = h VOSC (U + %) (70)
With 0:0, 1,2,
Again, normalization by he can be done yielding:
E . U

The energy scheme of a linear harmonic oscillator consists of equi-distant steps hVOSC With a minimum
energy value h VOSC / 2. o is the Vibrational quantum number and co represents the Vibrational frequency. In
contradiction to the rotation, transitions between Vibrational energy levels With quantum number
differences higher than 1 are also allowed. The wave numbers of pure Vibrational lines (Which means that
both upper and lower level belongs to the same electronic state and that no change in rotational energy
occurs Which is equivalent to AI = 0) are given by:
N AE ib U — U
v = h—CV = ¥vm (72)
From this equation, the distances between the single lines are supposed to be multiples of the ground
frequency diVided by 6. Again, this expectation is not fulﬁlled completely in reality Which can be
explained by the fact that a molecule has to be seen as a so-ealled anharmonic oscillator. To illustrate this
coherence, the potential curves for both harmonic and anharmonic oscillators are plotted in Fig. 41. They
show the potential of the forces between the nuclei as a function of the nuclear distance. The quantisized
Vibrational energy levels Evib can be seen as horizontal lines of constant energy as drawn in Fig. 41. In the
ease of a harmonic oscillator, the potential curve appears as a symmetrical parabolic function. If one
nucleus is regarded as ﬁxed, the other one would oscillate like a ball Which rolls along the curve. The
points Where the energy levels cross the curve are the reversal points of this oscillation. This model does
not agree With reality in two essential points. First, in the simple model there is no theoretical reason that
the distance between the nuclei could not decrease to zero. In reality, this is physically not possible
because the electrostatic forces between the two positively charged nuclei would rise very quickly. On the
other hand, the potential is not allowed to rise until inﬁnity With increasing distance between the nuclei.
The force between the nuclei Which is produced by the electrons is only decreasing With rising distance
until the molecule becomes dissociated. As can be seen from the potential curves, reality is better
represented by the model of the anharmonic oscillator. In this case, the energy levels are no longer
equidistant.

3.3 For the experimenter: The Molecular Spectrum
The emission line in molecular emission spectra is based on the superposition of electronic, Vibrational
and rotational transitions. The wave number of each emission line is given by the total change in energy.
Often, the upper state of a transition is characterized by ' and the lower state by Using this
nomenclature, equation (55) can be written as:

Depending on the question Which part of the spectra (purely rotational, rovibrational) is observed, Eq. (73)
has to be reduced. Furthermore, not every combination of v’ and v” is allowed according to the quantum
mechanical selection rule. A famous representation of the different emission lines is a plot of the rotational
quantum numbers versus the wave number. These resulting graphs are called Fortrat parabolas. Similar to
the wave number, the intensity of an emission line is represented by a superposition of electronic,
Vibrational and rotational transition intensity. But the amount of light absorbed 0r emitted by atoms or

the populations of atoms or molecules in the energy levels follow the Boltzmann distribution:

Under the assumption of this Boltzmann distribution, the intensity of each emission line is given by:

Here K is a function of the electronic transition moment and the partition functions for the electronic,
Vibrational and rotational transition and therefore of electronic, Vibrational and rotational temperature but
not of rotational or Vibrational quantum number. For a given plasma state, K is a constant.
S J is the Honl- London factor Which describes the statistical weights for the transition. It is a measure how
the radiation energy is distributed over the different rotational modes. To illustrate the appearance of a
molecular spectrum according to this theory, Fig. 42 shows the N; First Negative band system in low
resolution With the different band heads and the ﬁne structure of the Av=0 band in high resolution
including the 0-0 and the 1-1 band head. The dark line represents a measurement in front of a hot material
sample that reached a steady state wall temperature of 1580 0C; the gray areas are a numerical simulation
of the emission. The Fortrat parabolas for the 0-0 Vibrational transition are added to the ﬁne structure
diagram. The molecular band is divided into different parts Which are formed by single rotational lines. In
the ease of N; these bands are degraded to the Violet Which means that rotational lines With rising
rotational quantum number are shifted to lower wavelengths. A11 rotational lines Which result from the
transition from the Vibrational level 0 to the Vibrational level 0 lie close together and form the 0-0
Vibrational band. The next band head at lower wavelengths belongs to the 1-1 transition. A11 higher
Vibrational transitions With Av=0 are adjacent. Together they form the Av=0 band system. Systems With
other differences in Vibrational quantum number such as Av=-2, Av=-1, Av=1 and Av=2 are similarly
formed.
3.3.1 Line Broadening
All the models explained so far result in a wavelength value Where the emission is expected and a value
for the intensity. However, the real measurement shows a more or less broad line proﬁle. This is due to the
fact that the theoretically found value is disturbed in different ways, summed under the term Line
Broadening:
The natural line-width in a plasma Without motion at low pressure (Which means that collisions between
particles are rare) is determined by Heisenberg's law of uncertainty and is in the dimension of 10'5 nm
Which normally can be neglected in comparison to the other broadening mechanisms. This effect is always
present.
The other most important processes for line-broadening are:

- Doppler effect

0 Interaction With other particles (pressure broadening such as resonance, Stark and Van der Waals

broadening)
° Zeemann effect caused by disturbing magnetic ﬁelds. The Zeemann effect gains importance if
strong magnetic ﬁelds are used.
The Doppler and the Stark effect are used in spectroscopy to determine thermodynamic quantities.
However, very highly resolved measurements are indispensable for these measurements.

Doppler Broadening
The motion of radiating particles causes a wavelength shifting of the emitted spectral line (Doppler shift).
Within plasma Without ﬂow velocity, the velocity values and directions of the single particles are
statistically distributed. A superposition of the different Doppler shifts yields a broadened intensity proﬁle.
If the Doppler displacement is strong in comparison to the other broadening mechanisms, the translational
temperature of the emitting particles can be determined from the Doppler half Width of the emission lines.
For this purpose, a high resolution spectrometer is needed. A Fabry-Perot interferometer fulﬁlls this
requirement.
Broadening by Interaction With other Particles
Neutral particles, electrons and ions in the plasma surrounding the emitting particles can cause
disturbances of the emission Which is proportional to the partial pressures of the emitting and disturbing
particles. This pressure broadening can be diVided into resonance, Stark and Van der Waals broadening.
To describe this procedure, the disturbing particles are mostly regarded as classical particles Which move
in the simplest case on straight lines With the velocity V. From a distance p to the emitting particle, the
effect of the disturbing particle can be noticed. Therefore, the time during Which the disturbance occurs is
on the order of
At z B. (77)
v
If At is short in comparison to the time between two disturbances, Which is normally valid for fast particles
such as electrons, the disturbances can be regarded as collisions and interpreted by collision theories. In
this case, the emitting particle is regarded as a harmonic oscillator.
If a disturbing particle passes the emitting particle, the phase of the above-mentioned oscillation is
changed. A Fourier analysis of the phase-disturbed oscillation gives a dispersion proﬁle With the half
Width Av H . The maximum value of this line proﬁle is shifted by AV compared With the proﬁle of the
undisturbed line With the frequency V0. At the regarded plasma states, the half-Width is mainly determined
by the Stark effect Which covers the interaction of charged particles caused by the forces due to their
electric ﬁeld.
In comparison to the emission Without disturbing effects caused by an electric ﬁeld, the emission of atoms
in an electric ﬁeld of the strength E is shifted by the frequency AV:
1 *
Av(E)=—C E2 (78)
272
Here, C * is the so-ealled Stark effect constant. A disturbing electron in the distance r to the emitting
particle produces an electric ﬁeld at the location of the particle With the strength
1
E 2 —£2 (79)
472290 r
and therefore causes a frequency displacement of the above described oscillator 0f:
1 2 1 C
Av(r)=— L C*—4=—ff (80)
27: 47780 r r
Therefore, the line broadening due to the Stark effect is proportional to ~r'4 With the constant Cw. So, the
equations for the line displacement AVVST and the half Width AVHST in a plasma With the electron density ne
and the average thermal velocity 17 can be written as:

Here, M is the molecular mass of the corresponding ion. In the above equations, only the inﬂuence of the
electrons on the emitting particles is taken into account. Due to their higher mass and their therefore lower
velocity, the inﬂuence of the heavy particles can often be neglected. Meanwhile, the simple model as
described above has been reﬁned by quantum mechanical considerations of the collision processes but the
principal results remain valid.
Due to their large line Width, especially the Balmer lines of the hydrogen atom are well-suited to
determine the electron density from the line broadening due to the Stark effect. Fig. 43 shows the Ha-line
at two different plasma states. The line Width of the Balmer line HB is even stronger than that of the HB'
line. At an electron density of me = 1023 m'3 and a temperature of T = 10000 K the half Width of the HB-line
is 45 A.
For plasmas Without hydrogen, determining the electron density from the Stark broadening is often
difﬁcult or even impossible because the effects of other broadening mechanisms (especially the effect of
Doppler broadening) are stronger than the Stark effect. Sometimes, small amounts of hydrogen can be
added to the plasma to enable the determination of the electron density as described above.
3.4 Emission Spectroscopy
Emission spectroscopy is one of the most important methods of plasma diagnostic measurements With the
great advantage of being completely non-intrusive. The emission spectrum contains information about

- its intensity

- the intensity distribution of the continuous radiation

rather difﬁcult. Generally, the applications of emission spectroscopic measurements can be divided into
three sections:
- The identiﬁcation of different atoms and molecules Within the plasma
- The determination of thermodynamic quantities such as temperatures and particle densities
- Gaining information about excitation and recombination processes Within the plasma
For the applicability of emission spectroscopy as a plasma diagnostic method to determine thermodynamic
quantities, a particular setup and important calibration steps have to be considered. Therefore, the
following section ﬁrst gives an overview about the basic experimental setup and the calibration steps
before some exemplary results are shown.
3.4.1 Experimental Setup
The results of emission spectroscopic measurements are inﬂuenced by different factors. Generally, the
measured data cannot be used for further evaluation Without any corrections. Although modern
spectrometers and monochromators are normally wavelength calibrated, an additional wavelength
calibration should be performed prior to each measurement because testing time is often limited and very
expensive. In any case, a spectral intensity calibration (either relative or absolute) is necessary to enable a
comparison of emission lines at different wavelengths or to determine thermodynamic quantities from the
absolute intensity of the measured emission.
Measurements in different wavelength regions require different capabilities of the experimental set-up. For
measurements of molecules in the ultraviolet wavelength region, the spectral transmittance of the optical
elements of the experimental set-up and the spectral efﬁciency of the detector have to be optimized for
utilization in the UV because at most plasma states the emission of the molecules is already weak. Fused
silica lenses and Windows as well as mirrors are the most commonly used optical elements. In any case, a
spectral calibration of the set-up has to be done Which Will be described below.
At higher wavelengths up to the near infrared, the choice of materials for the optical elements is rather
easy because most optical materials have sufﬁcient characteristic properties in this wavelength region. On
the other hand, most detectors suffer from decreasing efﬁciency close to the infrared especially if they are
sensitive in the UV region. Another important disturbance is second order radiation. Due to self-
absorption in air below 185 nm this effect gains importance only at wavelengths above 390 nm. To
prevent the measured data from second order radiation, spectral ﬁlters are used to block radiation at

wavelength below the region of interest.
Fig. 44 shows a typical setup for emission spectroscopic measurements. The emitted radiation is focused
onto the entrance slit of a spectrometer Where the spectral decomposition takes place. At the eXit of the
spectrometer, the transmitted light is collected by a detector. The focusing elements of the optical set-up
have a remarkable inﬂuence on the results. In the set-up presented all lenses have been replaced by mirrors
to minimize chromatic aberration Which causes a shifting of the focus. If extensive wavelength ranges
have to be detected, this shifting causes signiﬁcant errors in the measured data. The mirrors are used for
focusing and for adjusting the measurement position inside the vacuum tank. Because of the
comparatively large focal length of 650 mm, a precise adjustment of the optics is an important requirement
for a successful measurement. For the adjustment procedure, the detector is replaced by a laser. The laser
light has to take the reverse optical path and enables both an adjustment of the optical aXis and of the
measurement position.
3.4.2 Wavelength Calibration
Generally, a wavelength calibration has to be done to relate the detector wavelength aXis to the emission
wavelength. Most spectrometer software offers a procedure to calibrate the single detector elements
although a manual calibration is also possible. For this purpose, the radiation of a calibration lamp With
emission lines at known spectral positions is measured. Fig. 45 shows the measured spectrum of a Hg-
lamp Which is one of the most commonly used calibration lamps. Usually, the spectrometer is adjusted
until one of the known emission lines appears in the center of the detector array. Other known lines are
used to perform a polynomial ﬁt (second order is most sufﬁcient) for the wavelengths of the other pixels.
3.4.3 Intensity Calibration
If the absolute intensity of the emission lines has to be detected, it is obVious that the sensitiVity of the
detector has to be calibrated. But even if only relative intensities have to be compared, at least a relative
calibration has to be done. The calibration is done by measuring a calibration lamp With already calibrated
continuous emission (e.g. a tungsten band lamp for the Visible wavelength region or a deuterium lamp for
the UV).
Sometimes, only the speetrometer-deteetor couple is intensity calibrated Which is done by illuminating the
Whole entrance slit of the spectrometer With the light of a calibration lamp. In this case, the calibration
lamp is placed directly in front of the entrance slit. The advantage is that the speetrometer-deteetor
combination has to be calibrated only once for a given wavelength range. The disadvantage of this
calibration is that all spectral transmissions of Windows, ﬁlters and lenses in the optical path have to be

known accurately. Additionally, the solid angle and the imaging factor have to be included in the ﬁnal
evaluation.
The better but also more time consuming method is to place the calibration lamp at the measurement
position and use the same optical path as in the measurement Which has to be calibrated. In this case, all
inﬂuences on the signal are included in the calibration procedure.
Fig. 46 shows the calibrated emission of two calibration lamps as tabulated by the manufacturer and the
measured values. The correction factors for the single detector elements are included in the diagram. The
emission of the tungsten band lamp drops down in the ultraviolet wavelength region Where the deuterium
emission is rather strong. On the other hand, the emission of the deuterium lamp is no longer continuous in
the Visible wavelength range. Thus, only a combined calibration using both lamps gives a valid correction
factor. Since the deuterium lamp itself is calibrated to spectral irradianee, the correction factors have to be
sealed by a constant factor to those of the tungsten band lamp Which is calibrated to spectral radiance.
3.4.4 Determination of Local Quantities, Abel Inversion
A main disadvantage of emission spectroscopic measurements is the fact that the measured signal always
consists of the integration along the line of sight as illustrated in Fig. 47.
The Abel inversion is a mathematical technique Which allows a reconstruction of the local values from a
vertical proﬁle of measured (that means integrated) intensities [(2) as long as rotational symmetry of the
radiation Within the measured volume is given.
The radiation of the plasma volume is described by the emission coefﬁcient g(r). The measured integrated
intensity [(2) is coupled to 8(1‘) by the Abel equation:
R r
[(2)22 j —g(r)dr (82)
r22 /r2 _ 22
R is the radius of the measured volume While r is the local radius. Solving for 8(1‘) gives
1 00 d1 / dz
£0”): —— I #612 (83)
72' z=r [22 _ 7'2
In most cases an analytical solution is hard to ﬁnd because a valid approximation of the integrated
intensities is not available. Therefore, a numerical solution is used Where the emission coefﬁcient is
considered to be constant over ﬁnite rings of the regarded volume. A reﬁnement can be implemented if a
linear transition between the measurement position is postulated to approximate the continuous course in
the real plasma. Fig. 48 illustrates the principle of the numerical Abel inversion.

Figure 49: Principle of the Abel inversion.
Figure B2.1 shows the measured intensities 1(2) and the Abel-inverted intensity i(r). The Abel-inverted
intensities drop down to negative values at the borders of the plasma jet. Theoretically, this could be
caused by absorption, but more likely these values are caused by numerical errors Which can accumulate
especially in the border region Where intensities are rather low. Generally, the Abel inversion reacts very
sensitively to functions Which are not constantly differentiable. For this reason, a smoothing of the
measured data often has to be performed ﬁrst.
The principle discussed is easily applicable if the local intensity distribution Within the plasma is of
particular interest as it was postulated for temperature determination methods. The problem becomes more
complicated if, in addition to the intensity distribution, the line proﬁle also has to be resolved, for example
to determine electron densities from Fabry-Perot measurements. Here, the line broadening changes over
the cross section as the electron density changes.
The measured intensity I(z) Within the Abel integral equation is not only described by the emission
coefﬁcient g(r) but also by the line proﬁle of the emission lines. The Abel equation becomes:
1 00 (d(l 2 A12 2 )/dz)
g(rmg (r): _ j M012 (84)
72' z=r ’22 _ V2
This expression gives a relation between the integrally measured broadening AKB(Z) of an emission line at
the wavelength 7» With the local broadening AKBQ). If g(r) is known from a conventional Abel inversion;
the local broadening can be calculated.
3.4.5 Exemplary results
The basic principles that determine the emission of atoms and molecules have been explained above. The
spectrum emitted by the plasma can be regarded as a superposition of the emission of the different
radiating species. Figs. 50 and 51 show the measured emission spectra of an air and a C02 plasma state
With the most important radiating species in the wavelength region between 200 nm and 900 nm in a 10W

resolution of 0.5 nm. The spectral emission as a function of the wavelength corresponds in the air plasma
to that of an equilibrium plasma state at a temperature of T = 117OOK but the emissions of the different
species have been scaled by different constant factors to enable a graphical representation in a common
diagram. The emissions of the atomic species have been reduced by a factor of 10'6 and the emissions of
the molecular species NO, NZ and Oz have been ampliﬁed by factors of 10, 100 and 300, respectively.
Generally, the UV-region between 200 nm and 400 nm contains the radiation of most molecular species
such as NO, NZ, Oz and N; With the exception of the NZ First Positive system. The strongest atomic
radiation can be observed close to the infrared wavelength region above 700nm. Fig. 51 shows the
spectral simulation of a C02 plasma ﬂow. It can be seen that the emission of CO is dominating the
emission over the Whole spectral range, While CN and C2 have some spectral regions were the radiation is
dominated by these species and other ranges (in the UV) Where this radiation is not of importance. Here,
absolute radiation quantities are shown, i.e. radiation intensity in W/(mzsr m) such that also the number
densities can be analyzed [57].

3.4.6 Identiﬁcation of Atoms and Molecules
Without a doubt, the identiﬁcation of unknown elements using the wavelength of the emitted spectral lines
is the oldest application of emission spectroscopic measurements. In plasma Wind tunnels, the
identiﬁcation of different particles is of particular interest for:

- Proving the existence of ionized species

- Detecting erosion products of the electrodes Which pollute the plasma

- Determining the plasma regions Where recombination, dissociation 0r ionization processes occur

(e.g. NO-formation due to catalytic effects).

0 Detecting erosion products of the heat shield materials.
Fig. 52 shows two spectra recorded during the re-entry 0f the automated transfer vehicle ATV-l. It is an
excellent example that the identiﬁcation of atoms and molecules is of particular interest as here the main
focus was to measure the distribution of the different fragments of the entering spacecraft and to ﬁnd out
Which fragment consists in Which metals, alloys or chemical hazards.

3.4.7 Temperature Determination from Atomic Radiation
The information about the plasma temperature is contained Within the intensity and the shape of the
spectral lines of the radiating species. Replacing the number density of the excited state nn under the
assumption of a Boltzmann distribution as introduced in equation (B235), the spectral emission
coefﬁcient am of a spectral line as introduced in equation (B22) can be written as:

Even Without knowledge of the particle density, a determination of the temperature by a comparison of
two emission lines can be performed. For this method, the fact is applied that the above equation formally
appears as a straight line equation y= b + mx With y and X being the logarithmic expression and the
excitation energy respectively and Where the slope contains the desired temperature. With only two points
Which means two emission lines the slope and therefore the temperature can be determined. To increase
the quality of the measurement, usually more than two lines are used. This method is called Boltzmann
plot and can be used both for determining atomic and molecular temperatures as explained in detail in the
following section. It should also be noted that if the two lines are energetically close to each other, the
determination of the temperature is difﬁcult. As an example, for the most commonly observed transitions
of atomic oxygen at 777 nm and 844 nm, the term E/(kT)=2880/T. At temperatures above 6000 K this
means that the change in T Will result only in very small changes of the intensity ratio.
3.4.8 Determination of Molecular Temperatures
In most cases, the distribution of the number densities of the excited rotational and Vibrational levels
follows a Boltzmann distribution. If single rotational Vibrational lines can be speetrally resolved Within the
measurements of the molecular bands, the application of a Boltzmann plot is possible to determine the
molecular temperatures.
A closer look for the intensity of single emission lines gives the basic principles for temperature
determination. Within one electronic transition the ratio of different emission lines is only a function of
rotational temperature if the Vibrational quantum number does not change.
Therefore, different rotational lines of the same Vibrational transition can be used to determine the
RTO-EN-AVT-194 15 - 49

"50","Overview Experimental Diagnostics for Rarefied Flows — Selected Topics miller”
rotational temperature. Knowing Trot, emission lines of different Vibrational transitions can be used to
determine the Vibrational temperature if absolute intensities are measured. Determining the electronic
temperature is only possible if different electronic transitions of the same molecule can be detected. But
even in this case, the assumption of a Boltzmann distribution for the electronic states is necessary.
Contrary to the rotational and Vibrational states, this assumption is seldom fulﬁlled and has to be veriﬁed
in any case. If only emission lines of one Vibrational transition are chosen, the terms Which contain the
electronic and Vibrational quantities can be concluded in a constant C. Similar to the procedure in the ease
of the atomic radiation it can then be written

I I I n ""14 hC
lanj =1n(C)— —F'(U', J') (88)
S J kTrot
Here, Inga 0an is the intensity of the regarded rotational line at the wavelength 7». The Hénl-London factor
S J gives the statistical weights of the different transitions as corresponds to the statistical weights gn used
for the atoms. If the intensities of different rotational lines are measured and plotted over the rotational
energy F', in the ease of a Boltzmann distribution a straight line is formed Where the slope -I/kT,,0t contains
the desired rotational temperature.
In Fig. 53 the application of this method to the emission of a Nf-moleeular band is shown [54]. The
theoretical linear relation can be seen clearly Which validates the assumption of a Boltzmann distribution.
If the measurement of speetrally resolved lines is possible only Within a limited wavelength region,
equation (XX), Which no longer has the formal qualities of a straight line equation, has to be used directly
for evaluation. It is no longer possible to use a Boltzmann plot to determine the rotational temperature.
The Vibrational temperature now has to be determined using the ratios of the intensities of different
emission lines. In the logarithmic form, these ratios appear as differences. Still, the constant C Which now
includes only the partition functions and the terms due to the electronic transition is eliminated from the
equation. Solving for Tvib yields for two different emission lines:

Besides the Boltzmann plot, a low resolution temperature determination can also be done by comparing a

computed and the numerically determined data are compared With the measurement. The spectrum Which
shows the highest resemblance to the measured spectrum gives the desired temperatures. One important
presumption is that each simulated spectrum can be accurately related mathematically to a certain couple
of the parameters of the model (in this case Trot and Tvib). Fig. 54 shows a parameter variation for the
selected molecular bands. The left diagram shows a variation of rotational temperature While electronic
and Vibrational temperatures were kept constant. The right diagram shows a variation of both T m and T viz).
The big advantage of this method compared to the Boltzmann plot is the much lower measurement time
needed and the possibility for the simultaneous measurement of both T m and T vib.
Applying this method using PARADE, the rotational and Vibrational temperatures have been determined
from the combined emission of the N; First Negative system and the N2 Second Positive system. The
temperatures presented are obtained from experiments at a plasma state With a mass ﬂow rate of 2 g/s air
and an ambient pressure of 290 Pa in front of a SiC sample at T=12800C and in comparison to a water-
cooled copper sample. Figs. 55 and 56 show the spatially resolved distributions of rotational temperature.
The strongly rising temperatures in front of the probe surface result from non-equilibrium effects such as
deviations from the assumed Boltzmann distributions or disturbances of the emitted spectra by molecules
other than N; or N2 Which are not included in the simulation. For this reason, the temperature values close
to the surface are no longer reliable but clearly show the non-equilibrium effects and thus the shape of the
boundary layer. The same distributions for the Vibrational temperature are also given in Figs. 55 and 56
(mid). Here, the effects of the different materials on the temperatures are even stronger. Figs. 55 and 56
show the correlation factors obtained from the measured data in front of the different surfaces. Again, the
non-equilibrium effects in front of the copper surface are much stronger than in front of the SiC surface.

The boundary layer is thicker and the gradients are stronger in the case of a copper surface. As clearly
seen in the temperature distributions, the effects of surface catalycity 0n the boundary layer shape can
easily be accessed by the temperature measurements. Thus, the correlation coefﬁcient Which expresses the
degree of resemblance between the measured data and the computed spectra is a well-suited indicator for
the boundary layer shape.
3.4.9 Detection of Erosion Products
Strong radiation of erosion products has been detected in front of an SiC sample at 17OOOC at a plasma
state With a mass ﬂow rate of 8 g/s and a stagnation pressure of 800 Pa at a distance of 368 mm to the eXit
plane of the plasma source.
Fig. 57 shows the measured line of sight emission of the silica emission line at 243.52 mm in the measured
volume [54]. The inﬂuence of the erosion products can be detected up to a distance of roughly 8 mm to the
probe.
3.4.10 Determination of Particle Densities

temperature must be accurately known and the measured data have to be calibrated to absolute intensities.
To determine atomic particle densities, the emission coefﬁcient 8m in equation (51) has to be replaced by
the intensity calibrated measured emission Inm and the equation has to be solved for the particle density n:

Theoretically, the determination of molecular particle densities from the emission spectrum is also
possible. The desired particle density is contained in the constant K in equation (3 8). Although the
assumption of Boltzmann distributed rotational and Vibrational energies is often valid, an application to
the electronic levels is not necessarily possible. Therefore, the determination of molecular particle
densities With other methods such as laser induced ﬂuorescence is better suited.
3.5 Fabry Perot Interferometry
A Fabry Perot interferometer is a high resolution spectral device based on the principle of multiray
interference. It can be used to measure particle speeds and translational temperatures. Axial and any
azimuthal speed components of the accelerated plasma particles that appear are measured by means of the
Doppler shift of their emission lines. The Doppler shift can be directly determined by simultaneously
displaying the plasma line With a reference line Which has not been shifted. In low pressure plasma ﬂow,
only mean velocities can be measured due to the low intensity of the spectral lines and hence rather long
integration times. To determine the line shift, a high resolution spectrum is necessary. This spectrum can
best be achieved by means of a so-ealled Fabry Perot Interferometer (FPI). Futhermore, heavy particle
translational temperature can be determined from the Doppler broadening of the observed spectral line.
3.5.1 Theoretical Principles of Fabry-Perot Interferometry

Figure 60: Reflection in a glass plate.
PEROT, in 1897. It essentially consists of two glass plates With a reﬂective coating on one side of each
plate. The plates are positioned parallel to each other and are a few micrometers to a few meters apart.
The function of an FPI is based on the interference of a smooth wave through multiple reﬂections on two
mirror plates. This phenomenon can also be explained by the multiple reﬂections in a plane parallel plate.
The two possibilities to differentiate are constructive and destructive interference. Constructive
interference appears When the phase shift of two overlapping, smooth waves is an integer multiple of 27:
(see Fig. 58). Otherwise a destructive interference reduces the transmission light intensity.
In the ease of a Fabry-Perot interferometer the multiple reﬂection takes place on the translucent inner
surfaces of two parallel glass plates. As Fig. 59 shows, an aperature partition on the optical aXis in the
focal point of lens 2 has the effect that only almost parallel light (9 z 0°) makes it through the FPI. If the
medium has the refractive indeX n between the plates, the following condition for the intensity maximum
of order m results:
mlOzan (91)
The Fabry-Perot interferometer can be adjusted to a declared wavelength by varying the parameters n or d.
Changing the refractive indeX of the medium between the plates, for example by changing the pressure, is
difﬁcult. Modern FPIs are, therefore, adjusted by changing the distance between the plates, e.g. one of the
plates is shifted by means of piezoelectric. The piezoelectric elements are steered through a ramp
generator and in this way they create a linear, periodic translational movement. This kind of scanning
makes it possible to represent several interference arrangements of a certain wavelength or rather makes it
possible for a deﬁned, narrow wavelength area to go through.
3.5.2 The Airy Function
The intensity I T of the waves penetrating the FPI is among other things dependent on the transmission T of
an FPI. The intensity is deﬁned as the percentage permeability in the exact resonance distance of the
mirror plates for a certain wavelength k0, that means as a quotient of the intensities With and Without FPI
in the path of the detecting optics. The reduction of intensity caused by the FPI is essentially determined
by the absorption and the scattering losses on the layers of the mirror-eoating, expressed by the mirror
depending constant AS and the reﬂection degree R on the mirror layers. In order to describe the
relationship of the transmitting to incoming intensity IT /1i, the so-ealled Airy function is used Which is
given by:

angle of the incoming wave, M as the wavelength of the transmitted light and m as the number of the
interference order. The Airy function is shown for two orders m in Fig. 60 for various degrees of
reﬂectivity of the mirrors.
For a given optical thickness (nd) the Airy function describes a Whole system of concentric interference
rings When the order m of the interferences is equivalent to a Whole number (m = 1, 2,...). For small
degrees of reﬂection R Wide interference rings result and the contours become more and more deﬁned as
the degree of reﬂection increases.
A measure for the deﬁnition of the interference rings is given by the so-ealled half-Width X, Which means
the Width of the proﬁle at half the height of the intensity maximum. For an interference ring of the order m
the intensity is reduced by half. Hence it follows that the half—width of the interference ring results in:

3.5.3 Characteristic Quantities of a Fabry-Perot Interferometer
For the two applications, i.e. velocity measurements and translational temperature measurements, the FPI
can be optimized With respect to the needed wavelength and wavelength shift resolution. The resolution of
the wavelength shift of the FPI means the ability to separate two spectral lines Which are very close
together. The resolution is of great importance diagnostic application. For the practical use of the FPI for
the purposes of detecting and identifying spectral lines, the Rayleigh criteria can be used. This is shown in
Fig. 60. TWO spectral lines must be clearly separated by means of a drop in intensity to at least 81% 0f the
corresponding line proﬁle maximum. To use the FPI to determine the Doppler shift and broadening an
exact determination of the central wavelength ?to related to the maximum intensity is indispensable.
According to Fig. 61, the resolution A?» A of the FPI is deﬁned as the half—width of a perfectly
monochromatic spectral line of the wavelength ?to. The useful resolution A?» A depends on two
characteristic quantities of a Fabry-Perot interferometer: the usable ﬁnesse F N and the free spectral range
AMT. A?» A is calculated from the quotient of both according to:
2m 12
AAA =—F 2—0 . (95)
F N 2ndFN
3.5.4 The Finesse FN
The quality of an FPI is described by the so-ealled instrumental ﬁnesse F of the interferometer. The
ﬁnesse is used to measure the performance of the FPI and describes the ability to resolve the spectral lines
Which are very close together. The larger the ﬁnesse of an FPI, the higher the resolution. The instrumental
ﬁnesse F is determined by the individual ﬁnesses 0f the degrees of reﬂection F R and the ﬁnesse F F of the
smoothness of the mirror plates. If an FPI is operated as a spectral device, in addition to the instrumental
ﬁnesse the characteristics of the collecting optics Which follow the FPI must be taken into consideration.
The useful ﬁnesse F N contains in addition the ﬁnesse 0f the aperture partition F p and the refraction ﬁnesse
F D. This can be calculated as follows:

As a result, the collecting optics following the FPI should be subjected to an optimization to keep the
useful ﬁnesse F N as close as possible to the value of the instrumental ﬁnesse F .

3.5.5 The Free Spectral Range
During movement of the FPI mirror plates, that is When the distance d between them is varied, the various
orders of interference of the wavelength under observation move across the detection apparatus, for
example across the aperture partition in front of the detector in Fig B42. The free spectral range AKF of
the FPI describes the wavelength interval in Which light is represented under the same order. It is given by
12
A1 = —0 97
F 2nd ( )
The free spectral range of the FPI can therefore be inﬂuenced by the variation of the distance between the
mirror plates d. For a very small free spectral range, the mirror plates have to be far apart. But on the other
hand, the useful total ﬁnesse F N decreases With increasing distance [4]. The resolution ﬁnally approaches a
minimum asymmetrically. It is already close to this value in the ease of nitrogen (N1) at a distance of
approximately 3mm [4]. The free spectral range can be determined experimentally by measuring two
orders of a monochromatic spectral line, for example of a laser With a precisely known wavelength and
small bandWith.
3.5.6 Doppler Shift and Heavy Particle Speed
The Doppler effect was discovered by Christian Doppler in 1843 While investigating the propagation of
sound waves. The principle effect oeeurs also With emission lines, to be resolved, however, only at very
high speeds. If a light emitting medium is moving With a speed V and the emitted light is observed by a
stationary receiver under an angle 0t to the propagating medium, the following equation is valid between
the wavelength 7» measured by the receiver and the actual emitted wavelength lo:
1 _ ﬁ
V 2
i 2 _C . (98)
A V
O l — — cos a
6
Here 6 represents the speed of light and 0t is the angle between the normal to the wave vector of the
spreading light and the speed V of the emitting particle. For plasma Wind tunnel applications 0t indicates
the angle between the optical aXis of the FPI and the ﬂow vector of the plasma stream. Because V is
generally very small compared to c, the root in the equation above is ~l. If the denominator in the
equation above is developed in a binomie row, While neglecting the term to the second and higher orders
the result is ﬁnally the following equation for the Doppler shift AM):
At — a a — a V 99
D— —O—O;oosa. ()
From this equation the plasma velocity V can be determined from the Doppler shift measurement. The
chosen angle, however, must be large enough so that AKD is larger than the resolution AAA of the FPI. For
the application in rareﬁed supersonic plasma ﬂows, 45° have turned out to be a good trade off between
available space and needed resolution.
3.5.7 Doppler Broadening and Heavy Particle Translational Temperature
While observing a plasma volume emitting radiation from any angle, a Doppler broadening of the spectral
line being observed occurs due to the random thermal movement (Vth) of the plasma particles. This
Doppler broadening AKT results from the overlapping of Doppler shifts A?» for Which the following is
valid:

Vth
A/tzi/to — . (100)
c
Contrary to the speed V in eq. (98), Vth is not a directed speed and the change in the wavelength is therefore
also not dependent on the angle. Because, however, the thermal speed is a function of the translational
temperature T tr 0f the corresponding particle, the temperature T tr can be determined by determining ART.
A purely thermal movement of the emitting particle corresponds to the distribution of the thermal speeds
of a Maxwell distribution. The particle concentration dn With a thermal speed in the interval between v and
v + dv is given by:

d_n: Lexp —ﬂ dv . (101)

v is replaced by dv and its derivative result is:

Q: /m_2exp 2""];[111 01W). (102)
n
In a so-called optically thin plasma the radiation absorption plays only a minor role and the intensities of
the spectral lines being observed are proportional to the concentration of the emitting particles. In a low
pressure plasma ﬂow, an optically thin plasma can be assumed. The result for the intensity of a Doppler

perpendicular to the plasma beam axis, the observation angle DC is always 450. A third ﬁber optic provides
the possibility to feed laser light into the FPI for calibration purposes. Each of the three ﬁber optics can be
plugged into an optical system Which parallelizes and Widens the light beam coming out of a ﬁber optic.
Using a fast intensiﬁed CCD Camera, the measurement of different spectral lines With one FPI application
can be realized. The spectral distinction occurs in the spectrometer and the fast camera records along the
FPI-aXis [56].
3.5.9 Exemplary Results
To examine the Doppler effects, one has to choose an adequate spectral line emitted by the plasma. The
line of interest has to be strong enough and in order to achieve high resolution, longer wavelengths are
preferred. One of the strongest emission lines rises out of the transition of atomic nitrogen at
k0=746.83 nm.
In Fig. 63, two orders of a typical shifted N1 emission line are shown. The distance between the two line
maximas represents the free spectral range AM =0.092 nm. There is a very small shift between the blue
and the red line Which is due to the View angle and leads to the measurement of the velocity. From the line
broadening the temperature can be resolved.
The axial distribution of the atomic nitrogen velocity in two air plasma ﬂows of different conditions along
the plasma plume centre line axis can be seen in Fig. 64. The values are taken Without Abel inversion. Due
to the relatively ﬂat velocity proﬁle in the zone of high emission in this case, an Abel inversion does not
change the result remarkably. The velocity distribution shows a “shock” behaviour With decreasing
velocity in the compression zone and acceleration in the expansion area for one of the test conditions.
The resulting temperatures in a radial scan for different plasma condition are pictured in Fig. 64 again
taken Without an Abel inversion.

3.6 Absorption Spectroscopy
This method is based on the same quantum mechanical processes as emission spectroscopy, only that
energy is absorbed and not emitted by the plasma. Accordingly, light is absorbed at discrete lines if the
radiation of a continuous light source is transmitted through a gas. These absorption lines correspond to
the discrete energy levels necessary for the excitation of atoms and molecules in the gas [59]. The
continuous spectrum of the calibration lamp observed through the absorbing medium (e.g. the gas or
plasma) therefore shows weaker intensities at these discrete lines. If the medium is regarded rectangular to
the optical axis Where the continuous radiation is not Visible, an emission line at the same wavelength as
the absorption line is Visible due to the short life time of the excited state.

3.6.1 The Coefﬁcient of Absorption
The total amount of energy absorbed per time and volume unit can be written as:
eabs = annmlvhv (106)
With:
nm number of particles in the absorbing state per volume unit
hv radiation energy
I V spectral energy density
The factor an is the Einstein transition probability for absorption for the transition m 9 n and describes
the number of absorbing particles per time unit and per spectral energy density in [m3 J '1s'2]. The product
an I V is an expression for the portion of particles in the state m Which absorb one photon With the energy h
v per time unit.
The total amount of energy absorbed per time and volume unit can also be expressed by the product of the
number of absorbed photons and their energy:
eabs = Kmnnmclv (107)
Where Km"" is the coefﬁcient of absorption. Combining both equations yields:
h V
Kmn Z—an (108)
c
The coefﬁcient of absorption has the unit [mzs] and is a measure for the amount of radiation of the
frequency v that can be absorbed by one particle.
In reality, similar to the emission lines each absorption line has a certain line Width Which is produced by
various effects (see section B2.l.2). Basically, the expression for coefﬁcient of absorption represents an
integration over this line Width and can be written as:
K... = I sz(v)dv (109)
3.6.2 Diode Laser Absorption Spectroscopy
Atoms are capable of absorbing radiation in only a very narrow frequency interval. For this reason, the
radiation source has to meet some special requirements. Nowadays, diode lasers are useful radiation
sources. Fig. 65 shows an experimental set-up for these kinds of measurements. The plasma absorbs part
of the incoming radiation at the resonant line. This part is directly proportional to the amount of particles
in the corresponding state of excitation. Spectral lines that do not eXist in absorption are transmitted
Without any reductions. Particularly in highly excited plasma ﬂows Diode Laser Absorption Spectroscopy
(DLAS) is useful. Here, diode lasers are cheap available sources for the diagnostics of excited levels. After
the spectral decomposition in the monochromator, the absorption line is separated and all other emission
lines are eliminated. The detector ,,sees” only one line. The comparison With the originally emitted line
gives the absorption.
To determine nm , the radiant energy ﬂuxes have to be regarded. According to Lambert's laW the relation:
—K n d
¢Dv : ¢oge m"" m (110)
is given, Where (|)DV and (|)0V represent the spectral radiative ﬂux prior to and after the transmission through
the absorbing region of the thickness d. If d is known and Km” can be determined for the speciﬁed
absorption line, the particle density in the state m (usually the ground state) is obtained from:

The above equation is valid as long as the half Width of the emission line of the radiation source is
remarkably lower than that of the absorbing line. If not, a part of the emitted radiation at both (spectral)
sides of the absorption line cannot be absorbed Which inﬂuences the results. Furthermore, nm has to remain
constant over (1. Otherwise, an Abel-inversion 0f the measured data has to be performed to obtain local
particle densities.
3.6.3 Exemplary Result
A tunable diode laser With external cavity can be applied for atomic oxygen detection. The schematic of
LAS system is shown in Fig. 65. The laser linewidth is less than 300 kHz. By setting a modulation
frequency the difference between laser light and background can be distinguished. An etalon Whose free
spectral range is 1 GHz was used as a wave meter. The probe beam is usually passing through an optical
ﬁber to the vacuum chamber wall and the transmitted signal is detected by a photo detector and
appropriate band pass ﬁlters. Setups using spectrometers are also possible. Signals are usually recorded
using digital oscilloscopes With rather high resolution and high sampling rates. For plasma j et applications
some restrictions to absorption spectroscopic methods appear. First, in most cases the temperatures are
rather high yielding a highly excited plasma. Thus, the particle densities determined by absorption
spectroscopy are no longer necessarily coupled to the ground state density [60].

3.7 Laser-induced Fluorescence Spectroscopy
Laser techniques are in use in plasma Wind tunnels for identifying particles, determining particle densities
of atoms, molecules and electrons and for plasma velocity measurements. A big part of our knowledge of
the structure of atoms or molecules could be gained by laser diagnostic measurement methods. Laser-
based techniques offer the capability of performing spatially and temporally resolved. The interaction
between the electromagnetic radiation of the laser and particles leads ﬁrstly to absorption and/or scattering
and in consequence to emission spectra. Laser induced ﬂuorescence measurements is a well-established,
sensitive technique for detecting population densities of atoms and molecules in speciﬁc quantum states
and offers the possibility of investigating species of interest in a selective way. The main advantage
compared to the so-far discussed non-intrusive diagnostics is that the ground state densities are accessible
and the results are absolute number densities. The main drawback is an immense experimental effort.
Among other laserspectroscopic methods, laser-induced ﬂuorescence spectroscopy represents a powerful
tool in plasma diagnostics for the sensitive veriﬁcation of atomic and molecular species in low-
temperature plasmas. Here, laser photons are used for state-selective excitation of an atomic or molecular
energy level of the respective particle species. Characteristic plasma parameters such as local particle
densities, temperatures and velocities can be extracted from the detected observed ﬂuorescence radiation.
With laser induced ﬂuorescence, an upper electronic state is populated by a laser source With an emission
frequency tuned to an optically allowed resonance between the electronically and rotationally vibrationally
excited state and a discrete lower state, typically the electronic ground level. Fluorescence then denotes the
following radiation emitted by molecules or atoms, decaying by spontaneous emission of a photon in an
optically allowed transition from a higher to lower energy state. The ﬂuorescence occurs parallel to other
processes Which act to de-excite the molecule, such as collisional energy transfer to other molecular states.
Fig. 67 shows the excitation and de-excitation processes involved in a laser-induced ﬂuorescence process.
After excitation (bu), the laser-populated upper state may undergo a number of subsequent processes.
Firstly, the molecule can be returned to its original state by stimulated emission (b21). Secondly, absorption
of an additional photon can excite still higher molecular states, including ionized levels. Thirdly, the
internal energy of the system can be altered in inelastic collisions With other molecules producing
rotational and Vibrational and also electronic energy transfer, the latter is often referred to as quenching
(Qij). Fourthly, interactions between the separate atoms of the molecule, known as internal collisions,
produce internal energy transfer and dissociation of the molecule. When the dissociation is produced by a
change from a stable to a repulsive electronic arrangement in the molecule, it is called predissociation.
Finally, there is the ﬂuorescence signal (A21) of the originally populated state and nearby states, indirectly
populated through collisions. This signal can be captured With a photodetector and can be related to
speciﬁc properties of the absorbing species through modelling of these state-to-state transfer processes.
The rate equations are conceptually and mathematically more traceable than the quantum approach, but
fail to include possible coherence effects. Generally, the validity of the rate equation analysis holds true
for laser pulses Which rise slowly compared to the characteristic collision time. The time dependent

i¢ j 1;: j
The ﬁrst summation represents events Which populate j While the second denotes loss processes. The total
rate coefﬁcient for all events transfering molecules from level i to j is Zij (s'l). A number of distinct rate
coefﬁcients are included in this overall coefﬁcient: the collision transfer coefﬁcient Qij (s'l), encompassing
both intermolecular and internal collisions, the Einstein coefﬁcient Aij (s'l) for spontaneous emission and
the coefﬁcient for laser stimulated processes Wij (s'l). For single photon laser stimulated absorption or
emission, Wij=BijIw Where Bij (emZJ'le) is the Einstein B coefﬁcient and IV is the laser spectral intensity.
Applying equation (B5.l) for the energy levels involved gives a system of differential equations. The
equations depend on the excitation and detection scheme used for a speciﬁc molecule or atom and have to
be solved taking into consideration the special properties of the quantum mechanical behaviour of the
particle. For a simple two level model, Where only the ground (index 1) and the directly excited state
(indeX 2) are taken into account, the system of differential equations becomes:

dN
752N1b12 ‘N2(b21 +1421 +Q21) (114)
Here, predissoeiation and photoionization have been neglected and the population of the excited state prior
to the laser excitation is negligible as well. The total population in the system is constant and for moderate
temperatures in good approximation equal to the initial population of the ground state N10 prior to laser
excitation. This population can be calculated With the Boltzmann expression. The lower indeX of N10
accounts for the state and the upper indeX indicates t=0, i.e. prior to the laser pulse, such that:
N1+N2 =eonstant2N? . (115)
The time dependent population for the excited state can then be written as:
W N0 _,,
N2(r)=%(l—e 1) , (116)

laser excitation irradiances, i.e. IV<<Ivsat, the ﬂuorescence is said to be in the linear regime, namely linearly
proportional to the input laser irradiance. For IV>>Ivsat , the saturated regime is reached, Where the
ﬂuorescence signal becomes independent of quenching processes and the laser irradiance. In the saturation
regime, the rates of laser absorption and stimulated emission become so large that they dominate the state-
to-state energy transfer into and out of the directly pumped levels. Saturation also maximizes the
ﬂuorescence signal. However, complete saturation is not easy to achieve, especially in the Wings of the
laser focus and during the entire duration of the laser pulse.
In the linear regime, the ﬂuorescence signal depends on the laser irradiance. Additionally the quenching
rate can be determined experimentally in the linear regime. In low pressure regimes and low laser
irradiances, the quenching rate can be measured by monitoring the exponential decay rate, i.e. the time
resolved decay of the excited molecules to the ground level. An excited level has a certain molecular
dependent lifetime, Which is described With: t=1/(A+Q). Here, Q stands for all de-excitation processes and
A again for the spontaneous emission rate. By monitoring the time decay, one can extract the de-excitation
rate, as seen in Fig. 68.
In general, the ﬂuorescence wavelength is different from that of the incident excitation and occurs
primarily, but not exclusively, at longer wavelengths. The photons emitted from the excited molecules
radiate undirected. Therefore, the ﬂuorescence signal can be detected under any angle, but it is
advantageous to detect the ﬂuorescence perpendicular to the propagation of the laser beam and
perpendicular to the plasma ﬂow under investigation because this provides the smallest observation
volume and a non-Doppler shifted absorption line.
There are two ways of setting up the experimental approach. In a single point measurement, the laser is
focused into the observation area and the ﬂuorescence is detected With a one-dimensional detector,
generally a photomultiplier tube (PMT). The selection of the ﬂuorescence wavelength can be achieved
either With a monochromator or With an interference ﬁlter. The output signal of the PMT is then captured
With a so-called gated integrator and boxcar averager. This device is designed to recover fast analog
signals from noisy backgrounds. It consists of a gate generator, a fast gated integrator and exponential
averaging circuitry. The gate generator provides an adjustable delay from a few nanoseconds to 100
milliseconds to an input trigger pulse before it generates a continuously adjustable gate of 2 ns to 15 us.
The fast gated integrator integrates the input signal during the gate. Fig. 69 shows an example of setting
the sampling gate of the boxcar averager (data acquisition device) in respect to the ﬂuorescence signal. For

resulting ﬂuorescence from the illuminated plane is imaged through an appropriate ﬁlter onto a two-
dimensional detector.
For many species of interest, such as H, O, N, Kr, and Xe, particle densities can only be calculated from
ﬂuorescence intensities if laser excitation is induced from the atomic ground state. However, to overcome
the energy gap between the ground state and the lowest energetic excited states, laser photons far below
200 nm are required. To circumvent the various problems of generation of laser radiation at such low
wavelengths, the energy for the excitation of an excited level is obtained by simultaneous absorption of
two laser photons. In Fig. 70, several excitation schemes including appropriate ﬂuorescence transitions are
shown for some atomic species.
In applications With respect to research ﬁelds in spaceﬂight engineering, atomic species of O, N, and Xe
are of particular interest. At present, Xe is used as a promising fuel in ion thrusters. Fig. 71 displays a
series of measurements in the plume of a RIT-IO ion thruster. In a spectral scan, the laser wavelength is
tuned over the spectral range of the (two-photon) absorption line, Which is deﬁned by broadening
mechanisms such as the laser bandWith and the Doppler broadening of the laser induced transition. In the
absence of saturation effects, the ﬂuorescence intensity is a measure for the particle density. Two-photon

spectroscopic experiments in xenon plasma concentrate on neutral particles since singly ionized xenon
requires, due to the distribution of the energy levels, laser photons below 200 nm even When tWO-photon
transitions are used, Which necessitates signiﬁcantly more complex experimental setups.
For the experimental simulation of atmospheric re-entry conditions in plasma Wind tunnels, there is a need
of generators to produce 0-, N—, and air plasma ﬂows of high enthalpy. Flow Characterization in the free
stream as well as near the surface of appropriate heat shield materials can be carried out by tWO-photon
laser spectroscopy in O and N.
In addition, there are several advantages if an in-situ calibration of a tWO-photon experiment is performed
using another tWO-photon measurement of a reference species in an environment of a deﬁned particle
density, provided that relevant atomic transitions in the reference species are known. A deﬁned
environment can be realized, during the calibration procedure, by integration of a ﬂuorescence cell in the
experimental geometry. In noble gases such as Kr and Xe, tWO-photon laser induced transitions can be
induced, Which are speetrally Close to the transitions of interest in O and N species of the investigated
plasma ﬂow. In Fig. 72, particle density measurements in an 0 plasma ﬂow obtained using a noble gas
calibration are shown for several discharge conditions, and are compared to the calibration technique using
Rayleigh scattering.
