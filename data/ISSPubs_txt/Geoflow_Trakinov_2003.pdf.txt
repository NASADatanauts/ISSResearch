ABSTRACT . '

Convection in spherical shells under the influence of a radial force ﬁeld is an important problem in classical
convection theory. It is difﬁcult to reproduce in a terrestrial laboratory though, because there gravity is
everywhere downwards rather than radially inwards. It turns out'that one can produce a radial force ﬁeld,
by applying a high voltage difference between the inner and outer spheres. The combination of the electric
ﬁeld and the temperature—dependence of the ﬂuid’s dielectric coefﬁcient then produces an 'r‘5 central force
ﬁeld. Of course, in a terrestrial laboratory one still has the external gravity as well. In order to eliminate this
effect and produce a purely radial force ﬁeld, an experiment is planned on the International Space Station.
In this paper we will present the results of numerical simulations intended to assist in the design of this
experiment, for example in choosing the optimal radius ratios. We solve for the onset of convection in such
an F5 force ﬁeld, as a funetion) 6f the radius ratio (varying between 0.3 and 0.6), the Prandtl number
(varying between 1 and 100), and the Taylor number (measuring an overall rotation of the whole shell,
which will also be possible in the experiment). © 2003 COSPAR. Published by-Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.
INTRODUCTION

We investigate convection induced by a radially symmetric electric ﬁeld in a rotating spherical shell ﬁlled
with dielectric ﬂuid. The two concentric spherical shells are maintained at constant, different temperatures.
The innere sphere is warmer and maintained at a constant temperature T1 while the outer sphere is at a
constant temperature T2. The ﬂow in this system then depends on the following parameters: the radius
ratio 17 = g, the Prandtl number Pr = v/k, and the Taylor number Ta = (ZQRg/u)2. Additionally, the
externally imposed electric ﬁeld drives the actual convection. How the Rayleigh number depends on the
strength of this ﬁeld is derived in the next section. We will also consider both non-rotating (Ta = 0) as well

as rotating (Ta > 0) convection. '

The problem of convection in spherical shells has been considered before by many authors. Joseph and
Carmi (1966) calculated the critical Rayleigh numbers via linear and energy stability analysis in the non—
rotating case, for different central force ﬁelds. Roberts (1968) calculated the ﬂow and the critical Rayleigh
numbers in the limit of very rapid rotation, and found that the critical Rayleigh number depends on the
Taylor number according to Ra ~ Ta2/3. Our numerical results here are also in good agreement With this
asymptotic limit. Busse (1970) also considered this case, and predicted that the ﬂow should take the form
of “Columnar cells”. Finally, Hart et a1. (1986) also considered a problem similar to the one we consider
here. They only considered a hemispherical shell though, rather than a full_shell, as we do here. Also, they
did not include the centrifugal force, so their results are only valid for small Ta.

This research is a numerical basis for the experiment on the ISS (International Space Station), that is
being prepared in the Department of Aerodynamics and Fluid Mechanics of the Brandenburg University of
Technology (Germany). ' .

GOVERNING EQUATIONS
Electrodynamics And Convection Without Retention (Ta = 0)
In their simplest, Boussinesq form the Navier-Stokes, energy and continuity equations, describing the
convection problem are:

’ ' \7 - U = 0 ' (3)

With boundary conditions ‘
T(Rl) = T1, T(Rz) 2' T2, U(Rl) = 0, U(Rg) = 0 ' (4)

The force F is due to the effect of this external electric ﬁeld on the dielectric ﬂuid. It has the form:

1 .
F = —§E2Ve (5)
and must be considered together with Maxwell’s equations
div(eE) = 0, rotE = 0 (6)
Since Variations in e (and also in the density p) are small, we can make the usual linearization
6 = 60(1- V(T - T2)) ' (7)
' P = 100(1“ a(T '- T2)) (3)
Using (7), together With stande vector identities, we can then rewrite F as:
i 1 2 2 1 . 2 1 2 I
F = ""§V(€E — 60E ) + ECO’YT2VE — §€07TVE , (9)

The ﬁrst two terms can then be combined with the pressure. That is, it is only the third term that will
actually drive any convection.

To discover then what VE2 is, we return to (6), and make the equivalent of the Boussinesq approxima-
tion. That is, we have already incorporated the temperature dependence of e in this buoyancy force we just
derived (the factor *7). Everywhere else though we :will treat 6 as constant, in which case (6) easily yield

Convection With Rotation (Ta > 0)

Convection with rotation is a more complicated problem than without rotation. First, because of the
Coriolis force, the problem no longer decouples into different spherical harmonics l. Instead, all l’s must be
considered together. (The m’s still decouple though.) Second, if one includes the centrifugal force as well, the
basic state is no longer U = 0. Instead, the centrifugal Will itself drive a nonzero (but still axisymmetric) ﬂow,
and the critical Rayleigh numbers one then computes will be for the onset of nonaxisymmetric instabilities
of that more complicated basic state. For small rotation rates the inﬂuence of the centrifugal force is of
course also small. But for T3. > 40000 and small Prandtl numbers it is very important. Furthermore, the
bigger the Prandtl number, the more important the centrifugal force becomes.

If we neglect the centrifugal force, we obtain the same basic state as in the non-rotating case. If
we include the centrifugal force though, we also have a Basic ﬂow, and one Which can only be computed
numerically.

The equations (21) - (23) with boundary conditions (15) are to be solved numerically. This is done
using the spectral code described by Hollerbach (2000). One example of the calculated basic ﬂow can be
seen in Figlire 1. On the left is the temperature distribution, Which we note is radially symmetric even for
quite large Taylor numbers. On the right is the streamﬁmction of the meridional circulation.

LINEAR STABILITY ANALYSIS ' ' V ‘

We next wish to investigate the linear stability of these analytically (for Ta = 0) 0r numerically’~ (for
Ta > 0) determined basic states. We therefore begin by introducing .

where U, T and Peff, are the basic state, and u, 8 and p the perturbation quantities. We then substitute
these expressions into the original equations, and neglect terms qliadratic in the perturbation quantities.

The boundary conditions for the perturbations are of course no longer inhomogeneous; instead, they
are simply
11(7)) = 11(1) = 0, 9(7)) = 9(1) = 0 (30)
From these equations we can immediately deduce one interesting result, namely that if the bifurcation
is steady rather than oscillatory, so that at onset 3/61: = 0, then the critical Rayleigh number will be
independent of the Prandtl number. Of course, only the actual numerical results can reveal whether the
onset is indeed steady rather than oscillatory. This turned out to be the case though.
Results ,
Calculations were carried out for different radius ratios 17 = 0.1 -— 0.9 with a step An = 0.02 and
Pr = 1, 10,100. The numerical simulations show the following results:
1. As already noted above, the initial onset of instability turned out to be steady in all cases. Rac
therefore do“ not depend on Pr, but only on n and the spherical harmonic degree l. Figure 2 shows
» these Rae versus 7) curves, for l = l to 20. .
2. We see then in Figure 2 that for narrower gaps (that is, as 77 tends to 1) Rac increases, and the most
unstable mode shifts to higher and higher 1.
3. We also see that for n > 0.6 or so it becomes increasingly difﬁcult to distinguish the most unstable
mode, because different modes are so close, and transitions from one mode to the next occur so quickly.
This is therefore a parameter regime that we will want to avoid in designing the experiment. Since
there are also technical difﬁculties in making the inner sphere too small, the speciﬁc radius ratios we
will concentrate on in future work will be 17 = 0.3, 0.4 and 0.5, where the most unstable modes are
l = 2, 3 and 4, respectively. This determination of the optimal radius ratios is the most important
result to emerge from these preliminary calculations.

4. Finally, we just note that timesteps of 0.001 were sufﬁciently small to ensure convergence in all cases.

We have investigated the stability of the basic ﬂow for ﬂuids with Prandtl numbers Pr = 8.4, Pr = 38.96
and Pr = 101.38. The results of this research are summarised in the Figure 4, Figme 5 and Figure 6. On
the Figure 4 and Figure 5 the difference between critical Rayleigh numbers With and without of inﬂuence
of the centrifugal force can be seen. The curve below corresponds to the case, if the centrifugal force is
neglected. As we can see, the centrifugal force is very important even for small Taylor numbers.

From these results we can draw the following conclusions:

1. For, ﬁxed Prandtl and Taylor numbers the critical Rayleigh number is larger for narrower gaps, just
as it was in- the non-rotating case. .

2. Even though these sohitions now do depend on the Prandtl number (because this drift in longitude
now means that 6/61? 76 0), they have very similar characteristics for all Pr.

3. For very large Ta the results do indeed tend to the Ra ~ Ta2/3 asymptotic scaling deduced by Roberts.

4. The computational requirements are considerably greater than before, ﬁrst of all because (as noted
above) this is now a two— rather than one—dimensional problem, with all the different l’s coupled
together for a given m (truncations on the order of l = 30 were sufﬁcient). Secondly, the timestep
now had to be considerably smaller, with timesteps as small 8310-6 required at the largest Taylor
numbers.
