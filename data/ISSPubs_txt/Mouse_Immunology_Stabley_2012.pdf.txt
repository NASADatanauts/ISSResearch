"2","29 ABSTRACT
30 Cardiovascular adaptations to microgravity undermine the physiologic capacity to respond to
31 orthostatic challenges upon return to terrestrial gravity. The purpose of the present study was to
32 investigate the inﬂuence of spaceﬂight 0n vasoconstrictor and myogenie contractile properties of
33 mouse gastrocnemius muscle resistance arteries. We hypothesized that vasoconstrictor responses
34 acting through adrenergie receptors (norepinephrine (NE)), voltage-gated Ca2+ channels (KCl)
35 and streteh-activated (myogenic) mechanisms would be diminished following spaceﬂight. Feed
36 arteries were isolated from gastroenemius muscles, eannulated on glass mieropipettes, and
37 physiologically pressurized for in vitro experimentation. Vasoconstrictor responses to
38 intraluminal pressure changes (0 to 140 emHzO), KCl (10-100 mM), and NE (10'9-10'4 M) were
39 measured in spaceﬂown (SF, n = 11) and ground control (GC, n = 11) female C57BL/6 mice.
40 Spaceﬂight reduced vasoconstrictor responses to KCl and NE; myogenie vasoconstriction was
41 unaffected. The diminished vasoconstrictor responses were associated with lower ryanodine
42 reeeptor-Z (RyR-Z) and ryanodine reeeptor-3 (RyR-3) mRNA expression with no difference in
43 sarcoplasmie/endoplasmic Ca2+ ATPase 2 mRNA expression. Vessel wall thickness and
44 maximal intraluminal diameter were unaffected by spaceﬂight. The data indicate a deﬁcit in
45 intracellular caleium-release Via RyR-2 and RyR-3 in smooth muscle cells as the mechanism of
46 reduced contractile activity in skeletal muscle after spaceﬂight. Further, the results suggest that
47 impaired end-organ vasoconstrictor responsiveness of skeletal muscle resistance arteries
48 contribute to lower peripheral vascular resistance and less tolerance of orthostatic stress in
49 humans following spaceﬂight.

"4","55 INTRODUCTION

56 The cardiovascular consequences of microgravity exposure are evident in the form of
57 orthostatic intolerance (3, 29, 50), reduced aerobic exercise capacity (19, 40, 50), elevated heart
58 rate (50), and hypovolemia (31, 50). In particular, up to 64% of astronauts experience orthostatic
59 intolerance after only 2-wks 0f spaceﬂight (5), whereas habitation in a microgravity environment
60 for several months or more results in Virtually all astronauts experiencing orthostatic intolerance
61 upon return to Earth (26). Early work in humans (5, 29) established that orthostatic intolerance
62 was principally the result of the reduced capacity to elevate peripheral vascular resistance
63 following spaceﬂight. Mierogravity-indueed adaptations in the vasculature were consequently
64 hypothesized to be a primary underlying mechanism to reduced peripheral vascular resistance
65 after the contributions from the baroreﬂeX (19), hypovolemia, and reduced cardiac chamber
66 volume were shown to be less pronounced (5, 50). One vascular bed that may be important for
67 understanding microgravity-indueed orthostatic hypotension is that within the skeletal muscle,
68 since approximately 40% 0f the increase in total peripheral vascular resistance comes from the
69 skin and skeletal muscle upon standing (3 9).

70 Human cardiovascular adaptations to relative disuse (i.e., bed rest or microgravity) are
71 well replicated in rat (12, 25, 38) and, more recently, mouse (36) models to simulate
72 microgravity Via hindlimb unloading (HU). The HU rodent model effectively induces an array of
73 cardiovascular changes that occur with humans in microgravity, including a cephalic ﬂuid shift
74 (7, 18, 23, 37, 51), hypovolemia (37, 41), resting and exercise tachycardia (25), postural muscle
75 unloading (25, 30), and decreased aerobic exercise capacity (13, 34, 36). Previous work utilizing
76 a terrestrial HU intervention in the rat has provided mechanistic insight into orthostatic
77 hypotension following disuse (23, 51). For instance, impairment of vasoconstrictor properties in

79 gastrocnemius muscle (10), was associated with reductions in medial wall thickness and medial
80 eross-sectional area of feed arteries and ﬁrst-order arterioles after 2-wk HU in rats (11); separate
81 experiments ruled out an enhanced vasodilator responsiveness (21, 24) in these resistance
82 arteries. Resistance arteries in muscle composed predominantly of slow-twitch ﬁbers, such as the
83 soleus muscle, did not exhibit alterations in vasoconstrietor function in HU rats (10). The
84 decrements in vasoconstrictor responsiveness (10) and the vascular remodeling (i.e., thinning of
85 smooth muscle medial layer) (11) in fast-twitch skeletal muscle were thought to be associated
86 with the headward ﬂuid shift and the lowering of arterial blood pressure in the hindlimbs (7)
87 during this microgravity simulation. The purpose of the present investigation was to determine
88 whether actual spaceﬂight impairs vasoconstrictor and myogenie responsiveness 0r induces
89 changes in gross vascular structure of mouse gastrocnemius muscle feed arteries, which are a
90 major source of vascular resistance in skeletal muscle (53). We hypothesized that
91 vasoconstrictor responses acting through receptor (NE), voltage-gated Ca2+ channel (KCl) and
92 streteh-activated (myogenic) mechanisms would be diminished, and that the decrement in
93 vasoconstrictor responsiveness would be associated with a thinning of the medial smooth muscle
94 cell layer of the arterial wall (10, 11).

96 MATERIALS AND METHODS
97 Experimental procedures were approved by the Institutional and Animal Care and Use
98 Committee at the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) and conformed to the
99 Guide for the Care and Use ofLaboratory Animals published by the US. National Institutes of
100 Health (NIH Publication 110. 85-23, revised 1996).

"
"6","101 Animals. Eleven female C57BL/6 mice (16-23 wks old) were ﬂown for 15 days 011
102 NASA’S STS-l31 space shuttle mission. Mice were housed in NASA’S animal enclosure
103 modules (AEMS) located 011 the orbiter’s middeek, maintained on a 12:12-h0ur light—dark cycle
104 and provided food (46) and water ad libitum. Eleven ground control (GC) animals (11-23 wks
105 old) were housed in identical AEMs within an orbital environment simulator at Kennedy Space
106 Center (KSC) to mimic the temperature, humidity and C02 levels of the space shuttle middeek.
107 GC animals were housed for the duration of the STS-l31 mission in the orbital environment
108 simulator beginning 48 hours after launch and ending 48 hours after landing, at which point all
109 experimental procedures conducted on the spaceﬂight (SF) animals were duplicated on GC
110 animals. The KSC veterinarian deemed all animals healthy prior to SF and GC experiments.

111 Microvessel preparation. Approximately two and a half hours after the landing of the
112 space shuttle the mice were anesthetized with 5% isoﬂurane inhalation and euthanized by
113 thoraeotomy and exsanguination. Hindlimb muscles were excised from the carcass and their
114 mass measured on a laboratory balance. Gastroenemius muscle feed arteries were dissected free
115 Via dissecting microscope (Olympus SZX12) and maintained in physiological saline buffer
116 solution (P88) on ice. During ongoing dissection procedures, mierovessel tissue was transferred
117 in a staggered fashion from KSC t0 the University of Florida’s campus in Gainesville, FL (~3-
118 hour drive) in order to facilitate the physiological experiments. Feed arteries were transferred to
119 a Lucite chamber containing PSS. Mierovessels were eannulated at each end with glass
120 mieropipettes, secured Via 11-0 ophthalmic suture (Aleon Laboratories, 1110., Fort Worth, Texas),
121 and pressurized with PSS. After eannulation, the isolated vessel tissue chamber was transferred
122 to the stage of an inverted microscope (Olympus 1X70) interfaced in series with a Video camera
123 (Panasonic BG310), a horizontal Video caliper (307A, Colorado Video, Boulder, Colorado), a

6

"
"7","124 data-aequisition system (Powerlab, ADInstruments, Colorado Springs), and a Video monitor
125 (Panasonic WV-BM1410). Vessels were equilibrated at 37°C and 90 emHzO intraluminal
126 pressure (53) for 15-min prior to investigation of vasoconstrictor and myogenic properties.
127 Bathing PSS was replaced every 15-min during equilibration and throughout the experimental
128 procedures. Intraluminal diameters were continuously measured by Videomieroscopic techniques
129 (10,11,16,21,24).

130 Experimental design. Intralurninal pressure was maintained and manipulated by way of
131 two independent reservoirs connected to the glass micropipettes cannulating the feed arteries.
132 Basal pressure (i.e., 90 cmHzO) was achieved by setting both reservoirs at the same hydrostatic
133 level. First, vasoconstrictor responses to increasing concentrations of KCl (10-100 mM) were
134 measured to investigate the contribution of voltage-gated Ca2+ channels. Target isotonic K+ bath
135 concentrations were achieved by balancing concentrations of NaCl and KCI in PSS such that
136 bath osmolarity was maintained (14). Second, active myogenic behavior was determined Via
137 stepwise increases in intraluminal pressure (i.e., from 0 emHzO to 140 emHzO) by raising the
138 height of both reservoirs in 20 emHzO increments. Intraluminal pressure was then decreased in
139 20 emHzO increments from 140 emHzO to 60 emHzO (10). Third, vasoconstrictor responses to
140 the cumulative addition of NE (10'9-10'4 M) were measured to investigate the contribution of
141 alpha adrenoreeeptors (10). Finally, maximal intraluminal diameter and medial wall thickness
142 were determined after two 15-min ineubations in Ca2+-free PSS at 90 cmHzO. A bolus dose of
143 sodium nitroprusside (10'4 M) (11, 24) was added during the second 15-min incubation in Ca2+-
144 free P88 in order to ensure complete vessel relaxation. Medial wall thickness was taken as the
145 mean of three separate wall thickness measurements from positions randomly selected along the
146 microvessel length. To measure medial wall thickness, the Video caliper used to measure

7

"
"8","147 intraluminal diameter was positioned on the far right or far left side of the vessel. The focal
148 plane was adjusted through the medial wall and the smallest distance between the inner and outer
149 surface was taken to be medial wall thickness. Variability among the three measures of wall
150 thickness for each feed artery was approximately 9% (range 0-15%) in GC mice and 8% (range
151 0-13%) in SF animals.

152 In a second set of gastrocnemius muscle feed arteries, the passive pressure-diameter
153 relation was determined using a similar protocol as that for determining the active myogenie
154 response. Vessels were exposed to two 15-min incubations in Ca2+-free PSS. During the second
155 15-min incubation, sodium nitroprusside (10'4 M) was added to the Ca2+-free P88 in order to
156 ensure complete vessel relaxation. Intraluminal pressure was increased in a stepwise fashion
157 from 0 emHzO to 140 emHzO and then lowered from 140 emHzO to 60 emHzO in 20 emHzO
158 increments. Maximal intraluminal diameter and medial wall thickness at 90 emHzO were then
159 determined as described above. Reported values for maximal intraluminal diameter and medial
160 wall thickness were derived from the averages of the two sets of vessels measured from each
161 animal.

162 mRNA. Gastroenemius muscle feed arteries of similar length were isolated from SF and
163 GC mice were snap frozen and stored at -80°C for later analysis of mRNA expression as
164 previously described (6, 14, 42). The RNAqueous®-Micr0 Kit (Applied Biosystems/Ambion,
165 Austin, TX) — specified for use in microdisseeted tissue — was used to isolate total RNA from
166 feed arteries. Vessels immersed in 100 ML of lysis buffer were homogenized using a pellet mixer
167 (Argos Technologies, Elgin, IL). The lysate solution was then passed through the RNAqueous®
168 silica filter for total RNA isolation. Total RNA was reverse transcribed into complimentary DNA
169 (CDNA) Via the High-Capaeity CDNA Reverse Transcription Kit (Applied Biosystems, Carlsbad,

8

"
"9","170 CA). Five ML of CDNA was then used for real-time PCR (StepOnePlusTM, Applied Biosystems,
171 Carlsbad, CA) to determine mRNA expression by way of TaqMan® Gene Expression Assays
172 (Applied Biosystems, Carlsbad, CA) speciﬁc for sarcoplasmic reticulum Ca2+-ATPase pump 2b
173 (SERCAZb; Mm01201431_m1), ryanodine receptor 2 (RyR-2; Mm00465877_m1), and
174 ryanodine receptor 3 (RyR-3; Mm01328421_m1). On the basis of data from a previous study
175 where 110 ryanodine receptor 1 mRNA expression was detected in rat mesenterie arteries (6), we
176 elected only to probe for changes in RyR—2 and RyR-3 mRNA expression.
177 Solutions and drugs. PSS buffer contained (in mM) 145 NaCl, 4.7 KCl, 1.2 NaH2P04,
178 1.17 MgSO4, 2.0 CaClz, 5.0 glucose, 2.0 pyruvate, 0.02 EDTA, and 3.0 MOPS with a pH of 7.4.
179 P88 was supplemented with bovine serum albumin (BSA; 1 g/ 100 m1; USB Corporation,
180 Cleveland, OH) and passed through a .22 um cellulose acetate filter (430015, Corning, New
181 York). Ca2+-free PSS buffer preparation was identical except for the addition of 2 mM EDTA,
182 the replacement of CaClz with 2.0 mM NaCl, and the exclusion of BSA. KCl and NE stock
183 solutions were prepared in PSS buffer.
184 Statistical and data analysis. Intralurninal diameters were measured in micrometers and
185 expressed as a percentage of vasoconstriction as follows:
186 % Vasoconstriction = (Db — Ds) / Db X 100,
187 where Db was the initial baseline intraluminal diameter measured before experimental
188 intervention and DS was the steady-state intraluminal diameter measured after agonist addition.
189 Spontaneous tone was expressed as a percentage of the maximal diameter (Dm) as follows:
190 % Spontaneous tone = (Dm — Db) / Dm X 100.
191 The signiﬁcance of differences in body mass and muscle tissue mass were determined Via
192 Student’s unpaired t-tests. Pressure-response and eoneentration-response curves were evaluated

196 existed between experimental groups (GC vs. SF). All values presented are means i SE. A11

199 RESULTS

200 Body and tissue mass. Total body mass tended to be lower in SF (n = 11) vs. GC (n = 11)

201 mice (SF: 20.85 i 0.65 g vs. GC: 2203 i 0.44 g, P = 0.07). Gastroenemius muscle mass was 7-

202 13% lower in SF mice (Table 1).

203 Vessel structure. Medial wall thickness (SF: 16 i 1, GC: 14 i 1 pm) and maximal

204 diameter (SF: 175 i 7, GC: 188 i 5 pm) at 90 emHzO were not different between groups (n = 11

205 for each group).

206 Spontaneous tone. Steady-state spontaneous tone measured before the KCl dose-response

207 (SF: 21 i 6%, GC: 19 i 3%), the NE dose-response (SF: 17 i 6%, GC: 22 i 6%), and the

208 myogenie pressure-diarneter response (SF: 21 i 5%, GC: 20 i 5%) was not different (P=0.951)

209 between groups (n = 11 for each group).

210 Vasoconstrictor responses. Vasoeonstriction in response to the cumulative addition of

211 NE was lower in gastroenemius feed arteries of SF mice compared to their GC counterparts (Fig.

212 1). Spaceﬂight also reduced vasoconstriction in response to isotonic KCI relative to GC mice

213 (Fig. 2).

214 Active and passive pressure-diameter responses. Active myogenic responses were not

215 different between gastroenemius feed arteries from SF and GC mice (Fig. 3). Likewise, passive
10

"
"11","2 16 pressure-diameter responses were not different between groups (Fig. 4).
217 mRNA expression. SERCA2b mRNA expression was not different between groups (Fig.
218 5A). However, both RyR-2 and RyR-3 mRNA expression were lower in SF mice relative to that
219 in GC mice (Figs. 5B and 5C).
220
2 2 1 DISCUSSION
222 The purpose of this study was to determine whether microgravity exposure alters the
223 intrinsic vasoconstriotor and myogenio responsiveness or gross vascular structure of
224 gastrocnemius muscle resistance arteries in mice. Based on previous ground-based studies to
225 simulate microgravity in HU rats, we hypothesized that vasoconstriotor responses acting through
226 receptor (NE), voltage-gated Ca2+ channel (KCl) and stretoh-aotivated (myogenio) mechanisms
227 would be diminished, and that the decrement in vasoconstriotor responsiveness would be
228 associated with a thinning of the medial smooth muscle cell layer of the arterial wall (10, 11).
229 The results demonstrate that microgravity exposure decreases vasoconstriotor responses elicited
230 through alpha-adrenergio receptors (Fig. 1) and voltage-gated Ca2+ channels (Fig. 2), but did not
231 affect myogenio vasoconstriotor responsiveness (Fig. 3). Spaceﬂight also reduced the expression
232 of RyR—2 (Fig. 5B) and RyR-3 (Fig. 5C) mRNA. Miorogravity did not alter the gross structure
233 or passive mechanical properties of gastrocnemius muscle resistance arteries, as evidenced by
234 the lack of change in both medial wall thickness and maximal intraluminal diameter, as well as
235 the passive pressure-diameter response (Fig. 4) after spaceﬂight. If applicable to the human
236 condition, these results suggest that miorogravity-induoed changes in the vasoconstriotor
237 characteristics of skeletal muscle resistance arteries could compromise the ability to elevate
238 peripheral vascular resistance and precisely regulate mean arterial pressure during an orthostatio

240 A variety of discrete vasoconstrietor stimuli were administered in order to elucidate
241 potential mechanisms of reduced vasoconstriction after spaceﬂight. NE and KCl cause
242 vasoconstriction through both the inﬂux of extracellular Ca2+ and efﬂux of intracellular Ca2+
243 from the sareoplasmie reticulum (4, 8, 43). In contrast, myogenie vasoconstriction in response to
244 elevations in transmural pressure is more dependent on extracellular Ca2+ for smooth muscle
245 contraction (27, 47). For example, although several studies indicate that mobilization of
246 intracellular Ca2+ stores may occur in the myogenie response (9, 32), release of intracellular Ca2+
247 is not essential for myogenie vasoconstriction of resistance arteries (48, 49). Therefore, the
248 differential effects of spaceﬂight to impair vasoconstriction to NE and KCl, but not to increasing
249 transmural pressure, likely reﬂect the different sources of Ca2+ recruited for the respective
250 smooth muscle contractions. These ﬁndings suggest that microgravity adversely affects smooth
251 muscle cell eytosolie Ca2+ control through an intracellular mechanism, i.e., either through an
252 impaired sareoplasmie reticulum Ca2+ release mechanism or an enhanced sareoplasmie reticulum
253 Ca2+ pump mechanism. To test this possibility, RyR-2 and RyR-3 mRNA, the ryanodine
254 receptor isoforms present in smooth muscle (22, 33), and sareoplasmie reticulum Ca2+ ATPase
255 (SERCA2b) (54) mRNA expression were measured in the gastrocnemius muscle feed arteries.
256 RyR-2 and RyR-3 expression were lower in skeletal muscle resistance arteries from SF mice
257 (Figs. 5B and 5C), whereas SERCA2b expression was not different between groups (Fig 5A).
258 These data implicate RyR-2 and RyR-3 alterations in reducing intracellular Ca2+ release and
259 diminishing smooth muscle contractile responsiveness to NE and KCl.

260 The findings of mierogravity-indueed impairment of vascular smooth muscle contraction
261 Via an intracellular Ca2+ release mechanism are consistent with those of several ground-based

12

"
"13","262 studies of HU rats designed to simulate spaceﬂight. Morel and coworkers (28) found lower
263 intracellular Ca2+ release in response to NE, angiotensin II and caffeine in rat portal vein
264 myocytes after 14 days of HU. Further, [3H]ryan0dine binding in the same myocytes revealed a
265 reduction in sarcoplasmie reticulum-based ryanodine receptors in the presence of unaltered
266 ryanodine receptor Ca2+ sensitivity and unaltered voltage-gated Ca2+ channel activity (28).
267 Colleran et a1. (6) also demonstrated a reduction in NE-, KCl- and eaffeine-induced
268 vasoconstriction 0f mesenterie resistance arteries, as well as decreased RyR-2 mRNA and
269 protein expression after 14 days of HU. These investigators reported no change in SERCAZb
270 mRNA expression in mesenterie vascular smooth muscle after HU (6), therefore obviating a role
271 for Ca2+ sequestration in reducing intracellular Ca2+ concentration.

272 Spaceﬂight did not alter medial wall thickness or maximal diameter of gastroenemius
273 muscle resistance arteries. However, unlike the present results, previous studies simulating
274 microgravity With HU rats have shown reduced medial wall thickness and medial eross-seetional
275 area With no change in maximal diameter of gastrocnemius muscle feed arteries and first order
276 arterioles (10, 11). These disparate effects of actual versus simulated microgravity appear to
277 have functional consequences on vasoconstrictor properties. For instance, neither the active and
278 passive pressure-diameter relations nor the vascular morphological characteristics are different
279 between SF and GC mice in the present study (Figs. 3 and 4). On the other hand, the decrease in
280 medial wall thickness in HU rats (11) is associated With a reduction in active myogenic
281 vasoconstriction and an increase in vascular distensibility in the passive pressure-diameter
282 relation (10). The reason for the difference effects of actual and simulated microgravity 011
283 remodeling of the vessel wall is unknown, but could reﬂect differences in the animal species
284 studied and the extent to Which ﬂuid pressure shifts under these conditions. With HU, for

13

"
"14","285 example, general cardiovascular adaptations (i.e., resting tachycardia and reduced exercise
286 capacity) appear equivalent between rats (13, 25, 34) and mice (36). However, the significantly
287 shorter body height of the mouse may fail to form a graduated hydrostatic column Whose
288 pressure gradients can be sufficiently altered in microgravity to contribute to the type of vascular
289 remodeling observed in HU rats. Whereas rats experience cephalic ﬂuid pressure shifts With HU
290 (7, 18, 23, 37), the relative short body length and height of mice may prevent changes of similar
291 magnitude in blood volume distribution during microgravity exposure.

292 To understand the impact that alterations in ﬂuid pressure gradients have on vascular
293 structure, one can examine how headward ﬂuid pressure shifts differentially induce regional
294 vascular remodeling. In HU rats, arterial pressure to the head increases by approximately 15-24
295 mmHg (7, 52); this increase in arterial pressure is accompanied by a thickening of the medial
296 layer of cerebral arteries (17, 51, 52, 55). Conversely, in the hindlimb 0f HU rats arterial
297 pressure decreases approximately 11 mmHg (7) and is associated With a thinning of the medial
298 layer in gastrocnemius muscle resistance arteries (11). Resistance arteries at or near the
299 hydrostatic indifference point of HU rats, such as mesenterie arteries, do not demonstrate any
300 remodeling of gross vascular structure (2, 6, 35, 52). The lack of change in gross structure of the
301 gastrocnemius muscle feed artery from mice ﬂown on the space shuttle suggests that mice,
302 unlike humans (50), do not experience signiﬁcant ﬂuid pressure shifts While in space. This
303 putative absence of a ﬂuid pressure shift undermines the utility of mice as a research model for
304 the study of gravitational stress on humans. However, despite this shortcoming, results from the
305 present study demonstrate that spaceﬂight has adverse effects on the vasoconstrictor properties
306 of skeletal muscle resistance arteries, similar to vessels such as the mesenterie arteries located at
307 or near the hydrostatic indifference point in HU rats (2, 6, 12, 35) and rats ﬂown on the space

14

"15","308 shuttle (20), Which have no change in gross vascular structure but impaired vasoconstrictor
309 responsiveness.

310 As mentioned above, neither spaceﬂight With mice nor HU of rats altered maximal
311 diameter of gastrocnemius muscle resistance arteries. This lack of change in vessel diameter
312 likely reﬂects preserved blood ﬂow to the portion of the gastrocnemius muscle perfused through
313 this feed artery during muscle unloading (10, 11, 25). Had the resistance vasculature of a
314 tonically active skeletal muscle been examined, such as that of the soleus muscle, we would
315 expect a decrease in muscle perfusion With microgravity-indueed weightlessness (25) and a
3 16 corresponding decrease in maximal diameter of feed arteries and arterioles (10, 11).

317 Impairment of vasoconstrictor responsiveness of skeletal muscle resistance arteries may
318 underlie, at least in part, the reduced orthostatic tolerance evident in humans following
319 spaceﬂight (5 , 29, 50), given that approximately 40% 0f the increase in total peripheral vascular
320 resistance comes from the skin and skeletal muscle upon standing (39). Therefore, strategies to
321 counteract this deleterious consequence of microgravity exposure are important for preserving
322 functional capacity and orthostatie tolerance following long-term spaceﬂight in humans. The
323 condition of orthostatic intolerance is usually corrected Within two days of return to terrestrial
324 gravity While complete orthostatic recovery is achieved in a length of time equivalent to that of
325 ﬂight operations (50). Recovery of orthostatic tolerance is achieved even after several months of
326 microgravity exposure (1). Swift adaptation to orthostasis upon return to terrestrial gravity
327 clearly involves compensatory adjustments in the autonomic nervous system (15) and blood
328 volume (19, 44, 45). Given the present results, characterization of the time course of the
329 purported recovery of vasoconstrictor responsiveness after spaceﬂight requires further in vitro
330 investigation in order to better understand the extent of its contribution to the recovery of

332 In conclusion, responses to agonist—indueed stimulation of both reeeptor- (NE, Fig. 1) and
333 non-reeeptor- (KCl, Fig. 2) mediated vasoconstriction were reduced after 15 days of spaceﬂight
334 in gastrocnemius muscle resistance arteries. However, myogenie vasoconstrietor responsiveness
335 was unaffected by microgravity exposure (Fig. 3), suggesting that the hyporesponsiveness of
336 agonist-indueed vasoconstriction may be mediated through an impaired sarcoplasmie reticulum
337 Ca2+ release mechanism. In support of this contention, both RyR-2 and RyR-3 mRNA
338 expression were lower in gastrocnemius muscle resistance arteries from spaceﬂown mice (Figs.
339 5B and 5C). Although these data support the hypothesis that impaired vasoconstrietor
340 responsiveness of skeletal muscle resistance arteries contributes to the relative inability of
341 astronauts to elevate peripheral vascular resistance after spaceﬂight, the mouse may not be an
342 ideal animal model to study this phenomenon. The lack of gross structural remodeling, or more
343 specifically, the lack of change in medial wall thickness suggests that blood volume
344 redistribution is insigniﬁcant in this animal during spaceﬂight. This is an important shortcoming
345 in our attempts to understand the effects of microgravity exposure on human cardiovascular
346 function.
