The Visible/infrared imaging radiometer suite (VIIRS) is now onboard the ﬁrst satellite platform man-
aged by the Joint Polar Satellite System of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration and
NASA. It collects scientiﬁc data from an altitude of approximately 830 km in 22 narrow bands located in
the 0.4—12.5 ,um range. The seven Visible and near-infrared (VisNIR) bands in the wavelength interval
between 0.4—0.9 ,um are known to suffer from the out-of—band (OOB) responses—a small amount of ra-
diances far away from the center of a given band that can pass through the ﬁlter and reach detectors in
the focal plane. A proper treatment of the OOB effects is necessary in order to obtain calibrated at-sensor
radiance data [referred to as the Sensor Data Records (SDRs)] from measurements With these bands and
subsequently to derive higher—level data products [referred to as the Environmental Data Records
(EDRs)]. We have recently developed a new technique, called multispectral decomposition transform
(MDT), Which can be used to correct/remove the OOB effects of VIIRS VisNIR bands and to recover
the true narrow band radiances from the measured radiances containing OOB effects. An MDT matrix
is derived from the laboratory-measured ﬁlter transmittance functions. The recovery of the narrow band
signals is performed through a matrix multiplication—the production between the MDT matrix and a
multispectral vector. Hyperspectral imaging data measured from high altitude aircraft and satellite plat-
forms, the complete VIIRS ﬁlter functions, and the truncated VIIRS ﬁlter functions to narrower spectral
intervals, are used to simulate the VIIRS data With and Without OOB effects. Our experimental results
using the proposed MDT method have demonstrated that the average errors after decomposition are

reduced by more than one order of magnitude. © 2012 Optical Society of America
