Abstract. A ZrNiSn half—Heusler compound was prepared by unidirectional solidification in
short—duration microgravity. When a ZrNiSn half—Heusler pellet with Zr:Ni:Sn=1:1:1(in
mole) was solidified in microgravity (m—g) by two different cooling systems, the sample
solidified in m—g had a different crystallographic alignment of ZrNiSn phase along the cooling
direction. However, both sample solidified in normal gravity (1—g) had no crystalline
alignment. The solidified sample in m—g had higher electrical conductivity along the cooling
direction than perpendicular to the cooling direction, although these samples did not exhibit
Seebeck coefficient anisotropy. This electrical conductivity anisotropy was found to be
affected by crystalline alignment of the sample. The thermal conductivity was also affected
by the structural difference of the sample.
1. Introduction
Ternary intermetallic compounds of general formula MNiSn (M=Ti, Zr, Hf), referred to as the
half—Heusler compounds, have semiconducting properties with a band structure and have been of
interest due to their potential as thermoelectric materials [1, 2]. The half—Heusler compounds usually
have been prepared by arc—melting and sintering the crushed arc—melting sample because it is difficult
to prepare a sample with uniform composition and ordering of the crystal structure due to phase
separation. Therefore the obtained samples had no crystallographic orientation, and the research
focus has been to improve the thermoelectric properties of these samples by changing composition and
annealing condition.

Previously, we succeeded in directly preparing the cubic crystal system samples with <111>
crystalline alignment, such as TbFe2 and SmFez, by unidirectional solidification in short—duration
microgravity [3—5]. The samples with crystallographic alignment had higher magnetostrictive
properties than those with random orientation. ZrNiSn half—Heusler compounds are cubic crystal
systems, and it is possible to synthesize samples with crystallographic alignment by using this
technique. In this study, we investigated the synthesis of ZrNiSn half—Heusler compounds with
crystallographic alignment by unidirectional solidification in short—duration microgravity and
measured the thermoelectric properties of the samples.

2. Experimental

Starting samples of ZrNiSn were prepared by arC—melting from the constituent elements
(Zr:Ni:Sn=1:1:1[mole]). Zr and Ni ingots were supplied by Rare Metallic C0., Ltd. (Zr 99.9% and
Ni 99.99% purity), and Sn ingots (99.999% purity) were supplied by Kishida Chemical C0., Ltd.
Because it is difficult to melt the arc—melted samples completely due to the mixture of the components
with high melting points (Zr—Sn alloys), the arc—melted samples were ground, and the pellets made
from this powder were annealed at 1273 K in H2 atmosphere to eliminate of those components by
solid—state reaction. These pellets were set on 2 different unidirectional solidification systems. In
system (1), the sample directly contacts the copper chill block; in system (2), the sample indirectly
contacts the copper plate through a quartz glass tube (figure 1). The pellet was put in the quartz glass
tube; the tube was then evacuated and filled with Ar gas up to a pressure of 0.1 MPa. The sample
was heated in an infrared furnace at around 1673 K until it was completely melted. The sample was
then unidirectionally solidified by contact with the copper block or plate. Microgravity experiments
were performed using a 10m drop tower at AIST and a 2m drop tower at YNU (figure 2). The
resultant samples were 8 to 10 mm in diameter and about 2mm thick.

The crystalline structures of the obtained samples were analyzed by X—ray diffraction (XRD; MAC
Science, MXP3 0r RIGAKU, RINT2500), and the microstructure and element distribution of the
samples were analyzed by optical microscopy (OM; OLYMPUS, BX51M) and scanning electron
microscopy with energy dispersive X—ray spectrometer(SEM; JEOL, JSM—5400 0r JSM—6390LV).
The thermoelectric properties of the samples were evaluated by electrical conductivity, Seebeck
coefficient, and thermal conductivity. The electrical conductivity and Seebeck coefficient of the
sample were measured by an electrical conductivity and Seebeck coefficient measurement system
(Ozawa Science, RZ2001i); the thermal conductivities 0f the samples were measured by the
laser—flash method (ULVAC—RIKO, TC—7000).

3. Results and Discussion
Figure 3 depicts the element distribution of the arc—melted sample and typical samples unidirectionally
solidified in 1—g (1—g sample) and m—g (m—g sample). The arc—melted samples had large Ni—poor
regions, which XRD determined were mixtures of ZrNiSn and Zr—Sn alloys. The 1—g samples had
more uniform composition distributions, and the m—g samples had almost uniform composition
distributions.

Figure 4 presents typical contact surface and cross section photos of the 1—g sample and the m—g
sample. Both samples contained many small bubbles. Analysis of the m—g sample revealed
sheet—like structure grains aligned in the cooling direction. In contrast, the 1—g sample had random
columnar and granular grain structures.

(a—1): Contact surface of m—g sample, (a—2): Cross section of m—g sample
(b—1): Contact surface of 1—g sample, (b—2): Cross section of 1—g sample

Figure 5—(a) plots the XRD results of the contact surface of the 1—g sample and m—g sample
acquired by using system (1). The 1—g sample had a pattern similar to that of the arc—melted sample
and had no crystalline alignment along the cooling direction. The m—g sample had very strong (111)
and (222) peaks. This result indicates that the m—g sample prepared using system (1) had a <111>
crystallographic alignment of ZrNiSn phase along the cooling direction. Because Microgravity
conditions produce a motionless and forceless melt and because the densest crystal plane in cubic
system is [111], we obtained a sample with [111] alignment by using system (1). Neither sample had
a crystalline alignment perpendicular to the cooling direction.

Figure 5—(b) plots the XRD results of the contact surface of the 1—g sample and m—g sample
acquired by using system (2). The m—g sample had very strong (200) and (400) peaks, but the 1—g
sample had no crystalline alignment along the cooling direction. This demonstrates that the m—g
sample produced using system (2) had <100> crystallographic alignment along the cooling direction.
When the sample was solidified using system (2), a ZrO2 layer was formed on the contact surface of
the sample with quartz glass. The obtained ZrO2 layers had a monoclinic crystal structure, and that
of the 1—g sample eXhibited random alignment. However, that of the m—g sample eXhibited strong
(011), (022) and (033) peaks, suggesting that the ZrO2 layer on the m—g sample had <011>
crystallographic alignment. Because monoclinic ZrO2 is transformed to high—temperature phase
(tetragonal or cubic ZrOz) when the sample melt solidifies, the aligned ZrO2 layer of the
high—temperature phase might be induced to produce a m—g sample with <100> crystallographic
alignment along the cooling direction.

Figures 6 and 7 plot the electrical conductivity (0) and Seebeck coefficient (S) of the 1—g and m—g
sample; Parameters O and S of the m—g sample were measured along the cooling direction and
perpendicular to the cooling direction, and those of the 1—g sample were only measured along the
cooling direction because the 1—g sample had no crystalline alignment. Both m—g samples prepared
by different systems had higher electrical conductivities along the cooling direction than perpendicular
to the cooling direction, and those of the m—g sample along cooling direction were higher than those of
the 1—g sample. The electrical conductivity anisotropy of the m—g sample obtained using system (2)
exceeded that of the m—g sample obtained using system (1). These results suggested that this
electrical conductivity anisotropy was affected by the crystalline alignment of the sample. In contrast,
the sample’s Seebeck coefficient did not exhibit any clear anisotropy, although there were differences
between the 1—g and the m—g sample and differences of the cooling direction.

Figure 8 plots the temperature dependence of the thermal conductivities and phonon thermal
conductivities 0f the 1—g and m—g samples along the cooling direction solidified using system (2).
The thermal conductivity of the material, 1», is the sum of the electron and phonon contributions:

k = >\'elect1r0n + >\'ph0n0n,
where kelemn is the electron thermal conductivity and kphonon is the phonon thermal conductivity. The
electron contribution to the thermal conductivity can be estimated by the Wiedemann—Franz law:
>\'elect1r0n = LOT)
where L is Lorenznuniber, which is 2.445X10‘8 W-Q-K‘2 for a degenerate free—electron gas system, and
T is the absolute temperature. The thermal conductivity of the 1—g sample was less than those
reported by Shen et a1.[6] and Kawaharada et a1.[7] because this sample contained many small bubbles,
as indicated in figure 4. The m—g sample also contained many small bubbles, and the thermal
conductivity was less than that of the 1—g sample. The m—g sample had a lower phonon contribution
to the thermal conductivity than that of the 1—g sample. This lower phonon contribution of the ni—g
sample was considered due to phonon scattering by combination with bubbles and Ni site vacancies
oriented by crystalline alignment.

Table 1 lists the dimensionless figure of merit ZT (= Sz-G-T/k) 0f the 1—g and m—g samples
prepared using system (2). The ZT values of the m—g sample were about twice those of the 1—g
sample because of increased electrical conductivity and reduced thermal conductivity. The
maximum ZT 0f the m—g sample was 0.35 at 900 K. The ZT values of the 1—g sample were lower
than those reported by Shen et a1.[6] and Kawaharada et a1.[7] because of lower Power factor
(=S2-0) 0f the 1—g sample. The ZT values of the m—g sample at 900 and 1000 K were higher than the
reference ones, although those of the m—g sample below 800 K were similar to those of the references.

conductivity anisotropy, and the thermal conductivity was affected by the structural difference of the
sample. The ZT 0f the sample with crystallographic alignment exceeded those of other samples, and
the maximum ZT was 0.35 at 900 K.
