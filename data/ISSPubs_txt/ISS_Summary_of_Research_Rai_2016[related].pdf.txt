Avallable onlme 23mm 2016 cently been revised to include updated statistics on the impacts of the beneﬁts, and new beneﬁts that have
developed since the ﬁrst publication. Two new sections have also been added to the book, economic de—
velopment of space and innovative technology. This paper will summarize the updates on behalf of the 155
Program Science Forum, made up of senior science representatives across the international partnership.

The new section on “Economic Development of Space” highlights case studies from public—private part—
nerships that are leading to a new economy in low earth orbit (LEO). Businesses provide both transportation
to the 155 as well as some research facilities and services. These relationships promote a paradigm shift of
government—funded, contractor—provided goods and services to commercially—provided goods purchased by
government agencies. Other examples include commercial ﬁrms spending research and development dollars
to conduct investigations on 155 and commercial service providers selling services directly to 155 users. This
section provides examples of 155 as a test bed for new business relationships, and illustrates successful
partnerships.

The second new section, “Innovative Technology,” merges technology demonstration and physical science

extensions of costly satellites in geo—synchronous orbit have applications to robotics in industry on Earth.
Flame behavior experiments reveal insight into how fuel burns in microgravity leading to the possibility of
improving engine efﬁciency on Earth. Nanostructures and smart ﬂuids are examples of materials improve—
ments that are being developed using data from 155.

The publication also expands the beneﬁts of research results in human health, environmental change and
disaster response and in education activities developed to capture student imaginations in support of science,
technology, engineering and mathematics, or STEM, education internationally. Applications to human health
of the knowledge gained on [55 continue to grow and improve healthcare technologies and our under—
standing of human physiology. Distinct beneﬁts return to Earth from the only orbiting multi—disciplinary

cost leads to more ﬁnancial incentive to enable small operators to
design and prove out their technology in space (Fig. 17).
5.4. Transportation technology
Combustion science is one of the longest running ﬁelds of re—
search on the ISS (Fig. 18). There is a long running campaign to
understand just how both simple and more complex fuels burn in
space. Understanding this process in microgravity helps us reﬁne
combustion models on Earth where gravity and turbulent buoy—
ancy—driven convection ﬂows make this process too difﬁcult to
model. Recent observations on ISS have shown that a phenomenon
known as “cool ﬂames” can be witnessed in the combustion
chambers in orbit to understand how lower temperature burning
could have signiﬁcant applications towards more efﬁcient fuel use
and new combustion engine designs in the future [37].

bots to work alongside the human crew to perform necessary tasks
