Abstract. Recently several experiments on directional solidiﬁcation of Al-6.5wt%Si-O.93wt%Fe
(AlSi7Fe1) alloy were performed under terrestrial conditions and onboard the International Space
Station (188) in the Materials Science Lab (MSL) with use of electromagnetic stirring and without it.
Analysis of the samples showed that stirring with a rotating magnetic ﬁeld lead to the accumulation of
iron-rieh intermetallies in the center of the sample and inﬂuenced the primary dendrite spacing while
the secondary dendrite arm spacing were not affected. In the present paper the accumulation of the
intermetallies B-AlssiFe in the center of the samples due to RMF stirring is demonstrated numerically
and the evolution of primary and secondary dendrite arm spacing is discussed.

Introduction

Aluminium-silieon alloys are used in many ﬁelds of industry and particularly in the aviation due to
their mechanical properties and lightness. Small amounts of other metals like Mg, Cu and Ni may be
added to an AlSi alloy in order to improve a certain property for speciﬁc work conditions, but it is
common for these alloys to have some amount of Fe and M11, and in the scrap their level can be rather
high [1]. However, the presence of iron and manganese may deteriorate the mechanical properties of
the alloy because of formation of intermetallie phases, which affect further the microstructure [1,2]. In
the frame of MICAST program [3] experiments on solidiﬁcation of a ternary AlSiFe alloy were
performed on earth and under microgravity conditions with and without electromagnetic stirring in
order to understand the effect of the convective ﬂow 011 the microstructure of the alloys with
intermetallie phases. In the present paper the experimental furnace MSL—LGF (Low Gradient
Furnace) [4] onboard the International Space Station (188) and experimental results are presented
brieﬂy. The attention is given to the numerical simulations of the space experiments and t0 the
explanation of the experimental observations.
Experimental setup

An internal part of the experimental setup is shown schematically in Fig. 1. The cartridge with a
sample of 0.8 cm diameter had 12 thermocouples placed with the distance of 2 cm. The heater zone
could be moved along the cartridge. In Fig. 1 the set-up is shown in a “zero position” when the

controlled solidiﬁcation of a partly molten sample starts yet without the stirring. During the
solidiﬁcation the heater zone was moved along the cartridge so the latter displaced to the cold zones
(1-3) with a pulling speed Vpuu. A part of each sample was solidiﬁed without stirring and a part under
the action of a rotating magnetic ﬁeld (RMF). The RMF was generated by a three-phase, 2-pole
inductor located around the furnace and ﬁxed with respect to it. A measured aXial distribution of the
magnetic ﬁelds inside the inductor is shown in the upper part of the Fig. 1. The maximal intensity of
the magnetic ﬁeld reached 5.7 rnT [4] at the geometrical centre of the magnet located near the border
between the adiabatic and the hot zones and decreased with the distance from this position. There was
almost no variation of the magnetic ﬁeld in the radial direction inside the inductor. The rotation
frequency during the experiment was f = 5 7 Hz. It was supposed that the position of the magnet was
kept the same during the solidiﬁcation with respect to the dendritie tips.

Experimental results
The experiments on directional solidiﬁcation of AlSiFe alloy in microgravity were made with
pulling rates of 20, 40, 60, 80 and 100 urn/s. The temperature gradient GT varied slightly around 1800
K/m. Based on the thermal history 011 the sample the length of the mushy zone was found about 2 cm.
The images of microstructure revealed that all samples solidiﬁed under the action of the RMF were
characterized by the segregated Si and accumulated platelets, i.e. B-AlssiFe intermetallics, in their
center (Fig. 2).

evolution with time is ongoing and results will be reported but preliminary results for the primary arm
spacing (PDAS) look similar to what was observed under terrestrial conditions [2]. The latter showed
that PDAS for the ternary alloy decreased with the cooling rate as well as with forced convection, i.e.
behave similar to the binary alloys. However, the coarsening of the secondary dendrite arm spacing
(SDAS), 212 , was found not affected by convective ﬂow [2].

Phase diagram of the ternary Al—7wt%Si—1wt%Fe alloy

According to the phase diagram for Al-rioh corner of a ternary AlSiFe alloy [5], solidiﬁcation
starts with the nucleation and growth of primary dendrites of foo-Al with rej eotion of Si and Fe to the
liquid. It is followed by eutectic growth when the intermetallios B-AlssiFe solidiﬁes simultaneously
with foo-Al dendrites. During the eutectic growth the Si is still rej eoted but the Fe is absorbed by the
intermetallios. Solidiﬁcation ends in a ternary eutectic point where Si starts to crystallize in addition
to the two other phases. To simplify further calculations, we linearized the phase diagram given in [5].
The concentration of silicon in the eutectic point was ﬁxed at C1, EP 2 12.6 wt%, the indices 1 and 2
refer hereafter to silicon and iron, respectively, and L states for the liquid phase. Then, the real
liquidus surface T L = f (C1, L 9C2,L) was presented in a form:

TL :Tn: +m1C1,L +m2C2,L' (1)

where partial liquidus slopes m1, m2 were taken constant for the whole range of concentrations of
silicon and iron (Table 1). Note that because of the linearization and a ﬁxed concentration in the
eutectic point the value of T n: in Eq.(1) was different from the real melting temperature of the pure
aluminum, on the other hand we got less error in the area of concentrations of interest. Solutes’
concentrations in the liquid and temperature for eutectic lines were also linearly related, i.e. presented
in the form

C1,L,eut (T) = aTT + bT (2)

C1,L,eut (Cum) 2 aC12C2,L,eut + bClZ - (3)

Using Eqs.(1-3) one can obtain for the eutectic point the temperature T EP 2 849.208K and iron
concentration C2,EP = 0.541wt% and derive similar relations for C 2’ L,eut' Partition coefﬁcients for Si
and Fe during the solidiﬁcation of foo-Al were taken constant and are given in the Table 1. No
partition coefﬁcients were used for the B-A15SiFe intermetallics since the mass concentration of Si
and Fe there is known directly by its chemical formula.

With values given in the Table 1 and ones used earlier for a binary alloy [6] a comparison was
made between the solidiﬁcation of a binary A1-7wt%Si and a ternary A1-7wt%Si-1wt%Fe alloys in
equilibrium conditions (Fig. 3) using lever rule [7]. There is a very little difference in the evolution of
the solid fractions, consisting for both alloys of foo-Al dendrites, with temperature decrease ti11 to the
temperature T z 876.7 K when the intermetallios B-AlssiFe starts to solidify in the ternary alloy
(Fig. 3a). The solid fraction for fcc—Al dendrites by this moment has already reached 0.2, i.e. the
growth of dendritic tips is hardly may be inﬂuenced by the intermetallios phase. Then the fcc—Al
dendrites and B-A15SiFe intermetallios grow simultaneously and by the eutectic temperature
T EP 2 849.208K their fractions are about 0.5 and 0.03, respectively and their sum is close to the
fraction of fcc—Al in a binary alloy which is 0.519. Evolution of the silicon concentration in the liquid
during the solidiﬁcation for the binary and ternary alloy is also similar (Fig. 3b) while concentration

of the iron in the ternary alloy varies non-monotonically because the intermetallic phase consumes the
iron. A normalized form for concentration (Cm — C091.)/ C0; shows a little higher rejection for Fe
during the crystallization of fcc—Al dendrites (Fig. 3b) due to the smaller partition coefﬁcient
(Table 1). Note that although the solid fraction for the B-AlssiFe phase is rather low, its surface may
be large at the expense of the thickness.

Simulations of the experiments performed in microgravity

To demonstrate the effect of convection on solidiﬁcation of Al-7wt%Si-lwt%Fe alloy numerical
simulations were made with the data registered during the experiments onboard of 188. The initial
time for calculations was Chosen at a few seconds before the magnetic ﬁeld was switched on in the
experiment. Only a part of the sample between the thermocouples TCOS-TCOl2 was considered, and
temperatures measured by them during the solidiﬁcation were linearly interpolated and used as
boundary conditions. Note that crucible with the sample moved during the solidiﬁcation relative to
the heating zones. Use of the data from the thermocouples TCOS-TCOl2 makes the treatment of the
heat transfer easier since they are ﬁxed to the crucible (idem for the sample). Simulations were done
in Fluent for a domain 14><O.8 cm with a 2D aXisymmetric model based on a two-phase Euler
approach. Initial temperature distribution was also interpolated from the thermocouples data and
values for the liquid and solid fraction were calculated based on a uniform distribution of the Si and
Fe in the domain. The action of the RMF was taken into account in a momentum equation as
Fe (r,z) = iy’aleaXr-‘P(z) [6] where 0' was an electrical conductivity of the liquid, r the radial
coordinate and ‘P(z) interpolated the axial distribution of the magnetic ﬁeld (Fig. l). Solidiﬁcation
module introduced with user-deﬁned functions was based on a lever-rule approach [8] extended to a
ternary alloy [7], without any undercooling. The permeability of the mushy zone were of
Karman-Cozeny type and based on Itz = 50 um (85 mm measured in the experiment), further details
can be found in [6].

Similarly to the experiments, simulations with 5 pulling rates were done, but we did not observe
any signiﬁcant effects which could be attributed to the pulling rate, thus the only one case for
Vpuu=4-10'5 m/s is presented. In Fig. 4 several instant ﬁelds are shown after 550 s of solidiﬁcation
under the action of RMF. As it was already discussed [9] the imposed RMF created the secondary
meridional ﬂow in the bulk liquid and for a moderate value of the electromagnetic force only one
stable (toroid in 3D) vortex eXisted near the solid/liquid interface (Fig. 4a). In the mushy zone with a
low solid fraction the ﬂow is directed almost along the radius toward the center of the sample that
leads to the central channel with segregated solute components. The latter consists of a zone of
primary fcc-Al dendrites followed by a “eutectic mushy zone” where fcc-Al coexists with B-AlssiFe

(Fig. 4b,c). Because of the segregation, the length of the primary mushy zone varies from 7 mm near
the edge of the sample to 2 mm in its center and eutectic mushy zone spreads over ~1.6 cm. The higher
the concentration of the both solutes is, the earlier starts eutectic solidiﬁcation and the higher is the
fraction of the intermetallics (Fig. 4b,c) as it was observed in the experiments.

Except the centre of the sample the B-AlssiFe intermetallics starts to appear rather deep in the
mushy zone. For example, at the distance of 3mm from the axis of the sample it appeared at ~5 mm
behind the primary dendritic tip (Fig. 5) When the fraction of aluminium dendrites is near 0.2. The
intensity of the meridional ﬂow (Vr,Vz) drops by ten times at 1mm behind the dendritic tip, therefore
the formation of the B-AlssiFe can hardly affect the primary arm spacing Via the ﬂow ﬁeld.

Therefore at the periphery one can expect decreasing of the PDAS for the ternary
A1-7wt%Si-lwt%Fe alloy due to convective ﬂow similar to a binary A1—7wt%Si alloy. However, the
effect of convection may be weaker due to the segregation of iron, Which molecular mass is two times
higher compared With that of A1 and Si. In the center of the samples even the early growth of fcc-Al
dendrites occurs together With the intermetallics phase that can change microstructure signiﬁcantly
but the presented model cannot demonstrated this being based on the average approach. Similarly,
this model cannot predict evolution of the SDAS because the latter is driven by transport processes at
the microscale and depends on the conﬁguration of the mushy zone. The insensitivity of the SDAS t0
the convection can be explained either by the blockage effect of the intermetallics plates, as was

"

proposed in [2], or probably by its damping due to the segregation of a heavier Fe as it said above. It
should be noted also that the model for SDAS coarsening for ternary [10,11] alloys were developed
for a permanent enrichment of the liquid phases by solute(s). This is not the case of
A1-7wt%Si-1wt%Fe alloy Where the concentration of Fe decreases once the eutectic growth starts due
to Fe consumption by the intermetallics phase.

Summary

Accumulation of the B-AlssiFe phase in the centres of the samples solidiﬁed in microgravity With
electromagnetic stirring was caused by the secondary meridional ﬂow. Under conditions of
solidiﬁcation and at the periphery of the sample the intermetallic phase appears deep in the mushy
zone and can hardly affect the growth of dendritic trunks directly or Via convection. The residual
convection in the mushy zone can be blocked by the B-A15SiFe plates or damped because of the
segregation of a heavier iron.
