We have previously demonstrated that low-shear modeled microgravity (low—shear MMG) serves to enhance
the virulence of a bacterial pathogen, Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium. The Salmonella response to
low-shear MMG involves a signaling pathway that we have termed the low-shear MMG stimulon, though the
identities of the low-shear MMG stimulon genes and regulatory factors are not known. RpoS is the primary
sigma factor required for the expression of genes that are induced upon exposure to different environmental-
stress signals and is essential for Virulence in mice. Since low-shear MMG induces a Salmonella acid stress
response and enhances Salmonella Virulence, we reasoned that RpoS would be a likely regulator of the
Salmonella low-shear MMG response. Our results demonstrate that low-shear MMG provides cross-resistance
to several environmental stresses in both wild-type and isogenic rpoS mutant strains. Growth under low-shear
MMG decreased the generation time of both strains in minimal medium and increased the ability of both
strains to survive in J 7 74 macrophages. Using DNA microarray analysis, we found no evidence of induction of
the RpoS regulon by low-shear MMG but did ﬁnd that other genes were altered in expression under these
conditions in both the wild-type and rpoS mutant strains. Our results indicate that, under the conditions of
these studies, RpoS is not required for transmission of the signal that induces the low-shear MMG stimulon.
Moreover, our studies also indicate that low-shear MMG can be added to a short list of growth conditions that
can serve to preadapt an rpoS mutant for resistance to multiple environmental stresses.
