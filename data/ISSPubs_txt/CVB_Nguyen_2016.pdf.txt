11.9 W rn‘2 K‘Z). A similar Change in decreasing trend was observed in the pressure gradient and liquid
velocity proﬁle. The reduced heat pipe performance at high cooling temperatures was consistent with the
reduced evaporation which was indicated by the decreasing internal heat transfer and the increasing liq—
uid ﬁlm thickness along the cuvette as seen in the surveillance images. The result obtained is important
for future heat pipe design because we now have a better understanding of the working temperature
ranges of these devices.
