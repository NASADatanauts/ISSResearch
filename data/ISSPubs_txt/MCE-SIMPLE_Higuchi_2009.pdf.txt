An extendible mast of a space-inﬂatable structure was used as a scientific probe onboard the sounding rocket
S-520-23 launched in September 2007. The inﬂatable structure extended successﬁally and worked well as a
scientific instrument. This was J apan’s first space veriﬁcation of a space-inﬂatable structure, and the world’s ﬁrst
use of an inﬂatable structure as a practical antenna. The extendible mast as an inﬂatable structure is called
“SPINAR” (SPace INﬂation Actuated Rod), and it consists of an extendible rod and inﬂatable extension
mechanisms. The rod, Which is an open section tubular member, can be stored around a spool and has the
advantage of structural rigidity When extended. The principle of SPINAR is similar to that of STEM (Storable
Tubular Extendible Member); however, relatively reduced weight and enlarged rigidity can be achieved in SPINAR
if light and rigid composite materials replace the metallic STEM rod. In addition, an inﬂatable thin ﬁlm tube is
used as the extension actuator instead of an electrical motor for weight reduction, the extension mechanisms are
simpliﬁed, and the storage and drive mechanism box are downsized. The inﬂatable tube does not have to be
rigidized because of the Virtual structural rigidization concept of the outer shell structure of the rod.
