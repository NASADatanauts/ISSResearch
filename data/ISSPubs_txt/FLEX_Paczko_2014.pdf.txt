3 Experiments on the combustion of large n-heptane droplets, performed by the National
m Aeronautics and Space Administration in the International Space Station, revealed a
3 second stage of continued quasi-steady burning, supported by low-temperature chem-
o istry, that follows radiative extinction of the ﬁrst stage of burning, which is supported
45 by normal hot-ﬂame chemistry. The second stage of combustion experienced diffusive
E extinction, after which a large vapour cloud was observed to form around the droplet.
*5; In the present work, a 770-step reduced chemical-kinetic mechanism and a new 62-step
E skeletal chemical-kinetic mechanism, developed as an extension of an earlier 56-step
8 mechanism, are employed to calculate the droplet burning rates, ﬂame structures, and
, extinction diameters for this cool-ﬂame regime. The calculations are performed for
f,» quasi-steady burning with the mixture fraction as the independent variable, which is
E then related to the physical variables of droplet combustion. The predictions with the
.0; new mechanism, which agree well with measured autoignition times, reveal that, in
G decreasing order of abundance, H20, CO, H202, CHZO, and C2H4 are the principal
D reaction products during the low-temperature stage and that, during this stage, there
028 is substantial leakage of n-heptane and Oz through the ﬂame, and very little produc-
< tion of C02 with no soot in the mechanism. The fuel leakage has been suggested to
E be the source of the observed vapour cloud that forms after ﬂame extinction. While
53 the new skeletal chemical-kinetic mechanism facilitates understanding of the chemical
b kinetics and predicts ignition times well, its predicted droplet diameters at extinction
>» are appreciably larger than observed experimentally, but predictions with the 770-step
ﬁ reduced chemical-kinetic mechanism are in reasonably good agreement with experi-
g ment. The computations show how the key ketohydroperoxide compounds control the
8 diffusion-ﬂame structure and its extinction.

1. Introduction
It is well known that alkane autoignition involves different chemical—kinetic mechanisms at
high and low temperatures and that there is a temperature range in between, the negative—
temperature—coefﬁcient (NTC) range, over which ignition occurs in two stages and the
ignition delay time tends to decrease with increasing temperature, contrary to the high—
temperature and low—temperature behaviours [1,2]. In homogeneous mixtures, transient
cool—ﬂame phenomena also are observed over this intermediate—temperature range, leading
to the chemical mechanism being characterised as cool—ﬂame chemistry. Until recently,

such phenomena have not been associated with diffusion ﬂames, although cool—ﬂame
Chemistry had been found to be of signiﬁcance in autoignition 0f alkane droplets in heated
atmospheres [3]. Experiments performed in the International Space Station (188), however,
revealed instances of two—stage alkane droplet combustion in which a hot—ﬂame stage,
after extinguishing through a radiant—heat—loss mechanism, was followed by a quasi—steady
stage of combustion sustained by cool—ﬂame Chemistry [4], as is supported by recent
computational investigations employing large detailed Chemical—kinetic mechanisms [5,6].
Because of its possible future practical importance, for example in HCCI engines [7], there
is interest in improving our understanding of this kind of combustion Chemistry [8].
The present contribution is a computational investigation addressing this topic. Instead
ofworking with large detailed chemical—kinetic mechanisms having hundreds of species and
E thousands of elementary steps, such as [1,2], a short mechanism for cool—ﬂame chemistry
8 is sought, which, besides agreeing with autoignition experiments, also explains the recent
E 188 results. While the various large mechanisms differ in many details and continue to
0:39 be improved [9], their predictions of the quantities to be addressed here do not appear
<ﬁ . . . .
v to differ greatly, further motivating our focus on smaller mechanisms. Another reason
3 that short mechanisms are selected for further study here is that they are more readily
g amenable to development of thorough understanding. Attention is restricted to n—heptane as
E a representative alkane of practical interest. We have shown, in particular, how asymptotic
3 analyses can be applied to a short n—heptane mechanism to explain the NTC behaviour [10].
a . . .
3 The short mechanism employed preyiously [10] had 56 elementary steps and is now
§ known on the basis of more recent developments to posses certain deﬁciencies, indicated
5 later, even though it provided good agreement with autoignition delay times measured
- in shock tubes and in rapid—compression machines. Moreover, we found that it did not
.4; predict the existence of any cool—ﬂame regime in our droplet—burning computations. In the
3; present work, therefore, the previous mechanism is re—evaluated and revised to produce a
'E 62—step mechanism. This new mechanism, which is equally amenable to asymptotic analysis
D (which, however, is not pursued here), does predict a cool—ﬂame droplet—burning mode. Its
0223 predictions will be compared here with those of the much larger reduced mechanism of
<3 Seiser et al. [11], which has less than 1000 steps and therefore is smaller than the large
§ detailed mechanisms referenced above.
a The general formulation of the quasi—steady droplet—combustion problem is given in
E the following section. After that, the new chemical—kinetic mechanism is presented and
3 compared with the previous mechanism, showing autoignition predictions. The computa—
“3 tional procedure and results for droplet combustion are then presented and compared with
#2 experimental results for droplet extinction diameters, followed by descriptions of predicted
E ﬂame structures and discussions and conclusions concerning the implications of the results.
Q
2. Formulation
In quasi—steady spherically symmetrical droplet combustion, the rate of decrease of the
square of the droplet diameter is the burning—rate constant
K = 8'O—Dln(1—|— B), (1)
[01
where ,0 is the gas density, ,0; is the liquid density, D is the thermal diffusivity of the gas and
B is the transfer number. Expressions for B and prescriptions for selecting average values
of the product ,oD are well known [12]. The value of B depends on the overall heat release,

Which is quite different for hot and cool ﬂames and Which Will depend on the Chemical
kinetics for the cool ﬂame.
Steady—state conservation equations in spherical coordinates apply for the mass of
Chemical species and for energy, pressure 19 being essentially constant so that momentum
conservation can be ignored. Total mass is conserved, resulting in the density—velocity
product being ,0v 2 ,0 mK/ 81/2, Where r denotes the radial coordinate, its value at the droplet
surface being r1. With ,u E ,0 mK/ 8, the differential equations for conservation of Chemical

<3 mass conservation. This same condition applies to the fuel mass fraction YF, for species 1'
E = F, but With D replaced by DF, While for other species that are not transported through the
a fuel surface the condition (rzle- /,u) le- /dr 2 Y1- applies there. With the droplet assumed
g to be isothermal, energy conservation across the droplet surface gives (rZA /,u) dT/dr = L
3 there, Where A is the thermal conductivity of the gas, and L is the latent heat of vaporisation
E per unit mass for the fuel. Finally, the gas temperature at the droplet surface is T = T l, the
E liquid—fuel temperature, Which Will be close to the boiling point but in principle determined
7‘: more precisely by the Clausius—Clapeyron phase—equilibrium equation involving YF and
L? providing a value of T1 slightly below the boiling point. Study of these conditions at the

2 The dependence of X 011 Z is needed in integrating Equations (8) and (9). It is necessary
3 to account for the fact that X approaches zero as Z approaches zero or unity and achieves a

the approximation
X = Xref(1_ Z)2[111(1— Z)]4 (11)
therefore is introduced for the variation of X, With Xref = ZD/ [r1111 (1 —|— 3)]2 taken to be
a constant, independent of Z, measuring the magnitude of X. In the computations, Xref is
employed as the reference value for the X ﬁeld. The functional form in Equation (11),
strictly valid only if ,0 and D both remain constant, is nevertheless qualitatively realistic
even With variable properties.
The integrations 0f Equations (8) and (9) require evaluation of the density ,0, Which
is obtained from the ideal gas law for the mixture in terms of the mass fractions Yi, the

molecular weights of the species and the universal gas constant. They also require the
thermodynamic properties of the species, enabling speciﬁc heats and heats Ofreaction to be
evaluated, as well as the Chemical—kinetic parameters for determining the reaction rates wi.
Equation (8) is solved for all species except nitrogen, Whose mass fraction is determined
from :1]: 1Y,- = 1. For simplicity, in Equation (8) the constant value D = 10‘4 m2/s,
representative of the thermal diffusivity around 1000 K, is used throughout. The formula
employed for the droplet diameter is

dl 2(8D/Xref)1/2/ln(1+B)a (12)
E derivable from the deﬁnition of X ref. In using Equation (12) to calculate extinction diameters,
g the value of B is obtained from Equation (1), With ,0 = 0.7 kg/m3, ,0; = 610 kg/m3, and
E D = 6 X 10‘5 m2/s, employing the experimental value of K. The errors associated With
0:0 neglecting the variable—property effects in these calculations are relatively small because of
<3 the low ﬂame temperatures, always less than 800 K, and high degrees of accuracy are not
3 sought in the computations.
a It is worthwhile to summarise the approximations that have been introduced in this
3 formulation. First and foremost among them is the artiﬁcial extension of the integration of
E3 the gas—phase equations, Equations (8) and (9), to Z = 1, the interior of the liquid in this
E problem. While there is, of course, no physical reality in integrating Equations (8) and (9)
8 over a range of Z greater than that in the gas phase at the droplet surface, Z above about 0.8
7‘: (where 188 K < T < 371 K), essentially no chemistry occurs at these low temperatures, s0
L? that there is very little effect on the predictions, the energetics of the vaporisation having
:9 properly been taken into account. A notable side beneﬁt of this extension is the added
g generality of the formulation, Which then can be applied to any non—premixed system, such
a as gaseous counterﬂow diffusion ﬂames With pre—vaporised fuel, for Which experiments
D designed to study cool—ﬂame phenomena may be devised. Second, there is some inaccuracy
2 in the assumed functional form for X in Equation (11). Finally, While optically thin radiant
3 energy loss can readily be included by adding an appropriate term to Equation (9) (as
é Will be done later in the computations of hot—ﬂame peak temperatures), the formulation
é) requires Lewis numbers of unity, precluding multicomponent transport descriptions as well
: as Soret and Dufour effects, some of Which become signiﬁcant for certain problems but
ﬁ are negligible for the particular cool—ﬂame experiments to be addressed. The formulation
é can be extended to include mixture—averaged transport, but that was not employed in the
2 present work.

Q
3. The chemical kinetics
As indicated in the introduction (Section 1), droplet—combustion computations employing
large detailed mechanisms [5,6] provided reasonably good agreement With the experimen—
tal droplet—burning results. The next section Will address extinction—diameter predictions
obtained When a mechanism of 2540 reversible steps among 556 species, a predecessor
of the mechanism used in [5], is reduced to 770 reversible steps among 159 species [11].
Comparable agreements Will be found, Which perhaps is not surprising, since the reduction
was achieved by simply eliminating species not expected to participate in that chemistry.
The question to be addressed here, then, is the effect of making a substantial reduction in
the 770—step mechanism, as is needed for developing a good understanding of the details
of the chemical kinetics.

"
"6","6 G. Paczko et al.
The previous 56—step mechanism [10] resulted in the requisite understanding, but, based
on newer information, analogous to that available for propane cool—ﬂame chemistry [13],
that mechanism lacked certain important reactions. Speciﬁcally, the step involving the
second addition of oxygen molecules was not taken to be reversible, and the decomposition
to hydroperoxyl and the conjugate alkene 0f the radical produced by the ﬁrst addition of
an oxygen molecule to a heptyl radical was not included. Because of this, the 56—step
mechanism was completely re—evaluated in the light of present knowledge, resulting in the
62—step mechanism listed in Table 1.
In that table, the step 12 is now reversible, and step 56 provides the missing decompo—
sition. Because of the decomposition step 57 that follows this last step, the new C3 H5 and
C3 H4 species, not present in the 56—step mechanism, now enter, and their chemistry must
3 then be included, resulting in steps 58 through 62. In addition, updated rate parameters
8 are now used in all of the steps, so that many of the values are somewhat different from
E what was listed in the 5 6—step mechanism. Finally, it may be noted that many more steps
b5!) are reversible in the 62—step mechanism than in the 56—step mechanism; if all forward and
: backward steps are counted separately, then the 56—step mechanism actually had, in that
; sense, 62 steps, while the 62—step mechanism has 77.
g The previous general description of the mechanism [10], including the applicable steady
2 states, still applies. Thus, following the various iscmerisaticns and reactions associated with
g the two successive additions of oxygen molecules to the heptyl radicals, the decomposition
3 step 15 0f the species previously [10] denoted as KET (heptyl ketohydroperoxide) initiates
§ the low—temperature branching chemistry. The key question is whether the heptyl radicals
5 are consumed mostly by this low—temperature path or by the high—temperature direct—
- decomposition path, steps 17 and 18. The latter situation occurs in the high—temperature
.4; regime for which reduced autoignition chemistry is now available [14], and the former
3; applies in the low—temperature regime, with the NTC regime existing in between. There is
'E a net production of KET at low temperatures and consumption at high temperatures, which
D leads ultimately to the NTC behaviour illustrated in Figure 1. That ﬁgure, which compares
028 the predictions of the 62—step mechanism with those of the 770—step mechanism and with
< experiment for autoignition times [15], demonstrates the good agreement provided by this
é updated short mechanism concerning ignition—time predictions.

ﬁ 4. Results and comparison with experiment
“é: Setting Di 2 D for simplicity, Equations (8) and (9) were integrated numerically by use of
#2 Equation (1 1) for different values of Xref, and Equation (12) was then employed as described
5 previously to estimate the corresponding droplet diameter. This was done for three selected
Q cases, as listed in Table 2. The ﬁrst case, normal air, corresponds to experimental runs 2—4
of [4, Table 1], the second, air at 1 atm diluted with 15% carbon dioxide, corresponds to
runs 7—10, and the third, a mixture containing 35% carbon dioxide at 0.7 atm, to run 23.
There is signiﬁcant scatter in the experimental data, not only in extinction diameters d],
but also, to a lesser extent, in the burning—rate constant K. The latter variation introduces
corresponding variations in the predicted value of d; (for any given value of Xref) from
Equation (12), according to the calculation procedure discussed previously. The maximum
value of Xref for which cocl—ﬂame solutions could be obtained with the mechanism of Seiser
et al. [11] is listed in Table 2; these predictions will be discussed later. These maximum
values deﬁne the extinction diameters through Equation (12), and the predicted diameters
are listed in Table 2, along with the corresponding experimental values, for run 2 in case 1,
for runs 7 and 10 in case 2, and for run 23 in case 3. It seems clear from these values that

Which are greater than the expected errors associated With the approximations underlying
the computational approach.

In each case, there is a range of Xref over Which both hot—ﬂame and cool—ﬂame solutions
exist. Figure 2 shows in Z space temperature proﬁles for both ﬂames in one representative
case. It is clear from this ﬁgure that the cool ﬂame exhibits a much lower peak temperature
and is located Closer to the fuel surface. A number of hot—ﬂame solutions were obtained in
the present study, but they Will not be shown here because their general Characteristics are
just as expected, and the emphasis is on the cool—ﬂame regime. Unlike approaches based
on the time—dependent equations [5,6], the present approach cannot describe the transition
from the hot ﬂame to the cool ﬂame, and so there is little motivation to investigate the hot
ﬂames by the present method.

§ [10] is the temperature above Which KET is consumed, and so temperatures in parts of the
5 reaction region in the diffusion ﬂames must be below crossover for the cool ﬂame to exist.
. The range of average reaction—zone temperatures over Which the cool ﬂame can be found
g corresponds approximately to the maximum and minimum temperatures at the ends of the
3; NTC region. From static stability reasoning, the cool diffusion ﬂame is stable in the NTC
'5 region but unstable outside, as Will be explained further in the later discussion.
D Figure 6 shows the calculated peak cool—ﬂame temperature as a function of Xref for
923 all three cases addressed. A rapid Change, With an approach to a vertical slope, can be
i seen at the smallest strain rates (the largest droplets). These largest diameters, in principle,
3 may be larger than the largest diameters seen experimentally during the cool—ﬂame stage
E because radiative extinction of the hot ﬂame may not occur soon enough to capture the
5‘ entire cool—ﬂame range. On the other hand, at the other limit, Where the temperature is seen
'8 to decrease more gradually, the small droplet diameter Where the cool ﬂame extinguishes
g diffusively should be seen in all of the experiments that exhibited a cool—ﬂame mode.
#2 The computations have shown that hot—ﬂame solutions exist over a much larger range
5 of strain rates than cool—ﬂame solutions, so that, in particular, hot—ﬂame solutions persist to
Q much smaller droplet diameters than the cool—ﬂame extinction diameters. This is evident
from Figure 7, Which shows the maximum temperature in the hot ﬂame, calculated as a
function of Xref, for all these cases. For these calculations, radiant loss from bands of water
and of carbon dioxide, based on [16], and from bands of heptane With their emissiVities
calculated from their reported absorptiVities [17], was included as an additional term in
Equation (9). Like WT, the algebraic form of this term is quite complicated, now involving
emissiVities of the Chemical species, rather than reaction rates. The radiant loss is responsible
for the decrease in temperature With decreasing Xref at the smaller values of Xref. The curves
end at conditions of quasi—steady radiative extinction on the left and quasi—steady diffusive
extinction on the right. The droplet diameters corresponding to radiative extinction here
are much larger than observed experimentally, possibly because radiant loss from soot
emissions, not included in these computations, is a contributing factor. On the other hand,

g the cool ﬂame produces negligible amounts of soot, and inclusion of band—emission radiant
0; losses in the cool—ﬂame calculations showed that they, too, have negligible inﬂuences in the
5 cool—ﬂame mode because of the much lower temperatures.
. Comparison of the two lower curves in Figure 6 indicates that the low—temperature
g extinction occurs at a smaller strain rate (a larger droplet diameter) in case 3 than in
3; case 2. This is in agreement with experiment (see Table 2) and is to be expected because of
'E the much greater degree of dilution with carbon dioxide in case 3. On the other hand, case
:2) 1 in this ﬁgure appears to experience extinction sooner, at a smaller strain rate than case 2.
03 This prediction is contrary to expectations, since the oxygen content of the atmosphere is
i greater in case 1, and it is unlikely to be consistent with accurate experimental measurements
3 of extinction diameters, although the scatter, an example of which appears in Table 2, is too
E large to be certain of this.
5‘ For case 1, the air atmosphere, experimentally the ratio of the droplet diameter at the be—
rg ginning of the cool—ﬂame stage to that at the end, varied from 2 to 5, while computationally
g the range shown in the ﬁgure corresponds to a maximum ratio less than 2. It appears from
g the shapes of the curves in the ﬁgure that solutions for case 1 perhaps should exist beyond
5 the range shown, particularly at the lower strain rates, where the vertical asymptote is not
Q seen in this case, but also at the higher strain rates because of the higher oxygen concentra—
tion. This emphasises the appreciable computational difﬁculties in obtaining solutions with
steady—state programs; very good starting guesses are needed for the iterations to converge,
and it may not have been possible to ﬁnd solutions that existed beyond the extremes for
case 1. This is a drawback that introduces some uncertainty in calculated extinction diam—
eters, even though the conditions at which the computation were made, indicated by the
points in Figure 6, were very Close together at the low—temperature limit.

All of the preceding computational results were obtained with the Chemical—kinetic
mechanism of Seiser et a1. [11]. For the 62—step mechanism it was found that the solutions
had the same general shape but could be obtained only over a much narrower range of
Xref than is seen in Figure 6, and at values of Xref about a factor of ten lower than in the
ﬁgure. Predicted extinction diameters thus are much larger for this 62—step mechanism

"

than for the 770—step mechanism, and they are about 3 times the values measured in the
experiments. This means that, even though this mechanism gives good NTC behaviour,
it does not give good extinction diameters. In this respect, diffusion—ﬂame extinction is a
more stringent test of a mechanism than is NTC. This result, along with the absence of
any cool—ﬂame mode with the earlier 56—step mechanism, also underscores the difﬁculty
of reducing the chemistry to extents that facilitate understanding; the predictions become
much more strongly dependent on speciﬁc rate—parameter values that are not well known.
5. Discussion and conclusion
The present investigation has focused on quasi—steady droplet combustion in the cool—ﬂame
E regime from a computational Viewpoint. In contrast to previous computational investi—
N gations, steady—state conservation equations were employed, rather than time—dependent
E equations. The fact that solutions were obtained with these steady—state equations demon—
co . . . .
:3 strates concluswely that the cool—ﬂame Chemistry can support quas1—steady droplet burning,
:5 at least for the n—heptane droplets considered, in the oxidising atmospheres addressed. This
; conclusion agrees with inferences made from previous, fairly recent, experimental and
g theoretical studies.
2 The existence of these stable steady—state solutions relies on the overall rate of heat
% release decreasing with increasing temperature. If a random perturbation momentarily
g increases the peak temperature in the diffusion ﬂame, then the chemistry responds by
0; decreasing the rate of heat release, thereby causing the peak temperatures to decrease back
5 to a stable value. Correspondingly, if the perturbation decreases the peak temperature, then
. the chemistry increases the rate of heat release so that the peak temperature increases to its
*3 stable value. This can occur only in the NTC range of the cool—ﬂame chemistry. The ﬂame
3; therefore is unstable at the higher temperatures where the hot—ﬂame Chemical—kinetics are
'5 more dominant and also at the lower temperatures where the increasing branching rates with
:2) increasing temperature, through the decomposition of the species that has been abbreviated
93 as KET [10], is dominant and decreases the heat—release rate with decreasing temperature.
<5: The fact that the existence of this cool—ﬂame droplet—combustion mode depends on the
$3 NTC Chemical—kinetic reaction rates causes the Characteristics of the diffusion ﬂame to
a differ in a number of ways from the characteristics of ordinary, more familiar, hot diffusion
E ﬂames. While the ﬂame temperatures of these hot ﬂames are essentially the adiabatic ﬂame
'8 temperatures of the stoichiometric reactant mixtures, the ﬂame temperatures of the cool
a ﬂames are determined by the chemical kinetics. Through the thermal diffusivity D, the
% droplet diameter d; determines a diffusion—ﬂame residence time dlz/D, which decreases
E with decreasing droplet diameter, and which imposes a time scale over which the Chemical
Q kinetics must proceed in order to support droplet combustion. In the NTC regime, this time
scale is too short to allow all of the reactants to be consumed, and therefore fuel and oxygen
leak through ﬂame, in amounts that increase as the decreasing droplet diameter decreases
the available residence time in the reaction zone. The classical diffusion—ﬂame parameter B,
measuring the overall amount of heat release, thus depends on the Chemical—kinetic reaction
rates and varies with time.

These time—scale considerations explain why the two—stage combustion of n-alkane
droplets was not discovered prior to the ISS experiments. The smaller droplets that are
generally investigated in ground—based experiments have time scales too short to fall within
the NTC range. Although larger droplets can be studied on the ground, buoyancy—induced
gas motion limits achievable residence times, preventing NTC time scales from being
reached in non—premixed diffusive conﬁgurations. It would be difﬁcult or impossible to

"

reproduce the 188 results on the ground (an observation with clear implications for ﬁre—
safety considerations in spacecraft).

The cool—ﬂame regime, initially established through radiative extinction of a hot ﬂame,
evolves through this Chemical—kinetic—controlled mechanism to ever decreasing ﬂame tem—
peratures as residence times decrease with decreasing droplet size, until the minimum
temperature of the NTC region is reached at which point the ﬂame becomes unstable
and extinguishes, leaving behind large quantities of unburnt fuel vapour in the gas, which
subsequently condenses into a vapour cloud. At the time of cool—ﬂame extinction, the fuel
droplet is still large enough to support a hot ﬂame, but the thermal energy in the cool ﬂame
around the droplet is insufﬁcient to ignite this hot ﬂame in this residence—time—limited dif—
fusive environment; otherwise hot ﬂames would have been seen experimentally following

3 the second—stage extinction. While the initial formation of the cool ﬂame through radiative
8 extinction of the hot ﬂame has been calculated computationally [5,6], the mechanism by
E which that occurs is not yet well explained and deserves further investigation. That mecha—
0:39 nism must in some way depend on a fortuitous relationship between rates of radiant energy
<ﬁ . . . .
<r em1ss10n and the cool—ﬂame thermal energy content in the NTC region.
Q If the radiant energy loss were to extinguish the hot ﬂame so early that the residual cool—
; ﬂame thermal energy content placed its ﬂame temperature above the maximum temperature
2 of the NTC region, then the cool ﬂame would be unstable and may experience a transition
% to a hot ﬂame. Theoretically this would result in oscillatory extinction and re—ignition of the
3 hot ﬂame, which usually is not seen experimentally, although it has been reported recently
§ for tests with higher normal alkanes [l8]. Radiative extinctions do often exhibit ﬂame
5 oscillations, but those oscillations generally are not spherically symmetrical and involve
- neither complete extinction of the hot ﬂame nor indications of any transient presence of cool
.4; ﬂames. In the opposite extreme, if the hot—ﬂame extinction by radiant loss occurred too late,
S; then the residual energy content may be so small that the resulting cool—ﬂame temperature
'5 would be below the minimum temperature of the NTC zone, and any cool ﬂame would
D rapidly be extinguished. The temperature proﬁle during radiant extinction, especially at
028 locations near the fuel surface, where the cool ﬂame will emerge, thus must strike a delicate
<3 balance for the transition to occur. The necessary balance is not well understood.
§ Re—ignition events have recently been predicted computationally when hot—ﬂame eX—
E tinction occurs early enough for the cool—ﬂame temperature to exceed temperatures in the
E NTC range [18]. Interestingly enough, these computations revealed that, following the hot—
8 ﬂame extinction, the energy content of the cool ﬂame was insufﬁcient to ignite the hot ﬂame
g for a second time, but it did re—ignite the same cool ﬂame. That is, an oscillatory ﬂame
% was established, with large temperature excursions supported by cool—ﬂame chemistry. Two
5 such cool—ﬂame re—ignitions were found to occur in these computations [18]. A variety of
Q different oscillatory behaviour thus is possible through the interactions of these Chemical—
kinetic processes. The present formulation, based on steady—state equations, of course is
insufﬁcient for addressing such oscillations. Its stability considerations serve only to expose
under what conditions the phenomena may arise. Further research would be desirable, to
develop simpliﬁed models for describing oscillatory behaviours driven by these cool—ﬂame
phenomena.

The two different chemical—kinetic descriptions that have been investigated here help to
shed light on the kinds of chemical—kinetic approaches that would be appropriate to adopt
in future investigations of these types of second—stage droplet—combustion phenomena. It is
Clear from earlier work that full detailed Chemistry, including all cool—ﬂame steps, generally
provides reasonable agreement with experiment. A drawback of that chemistry is that it is
computationally taxing. We have shown that, by removing species that do not participate,

"
"16","16 G. Paczko et al.
descriptions with less than 200 species and less than 1000 steps work equally well. This is
similar to ﬁndings in earlier computational work [5]. That degree of reduction, however, is
still insufﬁcient to provide the simpliﬁcations needed to obtain a thorough understanding
of the combustion processes. In attempting to develop a skeletal mechanism that is small
enough for that purpose, we have found that our 62—step mechanism, with less than 40
species, while qualitatively reproducing the observed behaviours, would provide very poor
quantitative agreement with experiment concerning second—stage extinction diameters.
This observation means that more research is desirable for improving the rate parameters
at this level of reduction. It was especially surprising to encounter this situation with a
mechanism that predicted the results of autoignition experiments so well. It is well known
that purely empirical mechanisms with as few as four steps can reproduce reasonably
E accurate NTC behaviour with suitably adjusted rate parameters. While such empirical
8 descriptions do contribute to understanding of the phenomena, they are not very helpful in
‘3 relating the predictions to the underlying detailed chemistry. Since they can, however, be
on . . . . . .
is useful in practice, it would be of interest to attempt to derive reductions at such extreme
v levels from a mechanism such as the present 62—step mechanism, from an improvement
3 of that mechanism that predicts cool—ﬂame extinction more accurately, or even from the
g 56—step predecessor of the 62—step mechanism, which has many of the needed attributes
E of the full chemistry. These droplet—combustion experiments thus appear to provide a new
% realm that is helpful for testing aspects of mechanisms, beyond what can be tested in
3 static—reactor, ﬂow—reactor or autoignition experiments.
