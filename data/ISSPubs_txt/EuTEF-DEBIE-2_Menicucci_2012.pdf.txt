i Abstract
DEBIE2 (Debris—in—orbit—evaluator) was launched in February 2008 as part of the European Technology Exposure
Facility (EuTEF) and installed on the exterior of Columbus on 188. DEBIE2 is an active detector, composed by 3 sensor
i units that monitor dust and debris. Each DEBIE sensor consists of 2 sets of wire electrodes sensitive to the plasma
g generated by 1mpact1ng particles, mounted 1n front of a thm alumlmum f011. 0n the f011 there are also 2 plezoelectnc
‘> w/ sensors which measure the momentum transferred by an impacting particle. If the particle penetrates the f011, thls can
’ g) be detected by a third electron plasma detector located just behind the foil. EuTEF and DEBIEZ were retrieved on lst
/ September 2009 and returned to Earth with the Space Shuttle Mission STS-128. In this paper, the results of the analysis
of impact data will be presented, as well as the results of the post-light inspection (optical and chemical analysis) carﬁed .
