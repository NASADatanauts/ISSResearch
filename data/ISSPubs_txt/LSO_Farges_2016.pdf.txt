Accepted article online 30 MAR 2016 of the lightning ﬂash waveforms (irradiance range and duration) and the size of the illuminated cloud top
were successfully quantiﬁed [Brook et al., 1980; Christian et al., 1983; Brook et al., 1985; Christian and
Goodman, 1987; Goodman et al., 1988; Vonnegut et al., 1989]. The technical requirements for the forthcoming
space lightning observations were then established [Christian et al., 1989].
Several |ow-Earth orbit satellite-borne experiments, launched in the 19905, such as the Optical Transient
Detector (OTD) [Boccippio et al., 2000a], the Lightning Imaging Sensor (LIS) [Boccippio et al., 2000b], and
the Fast On-orbit Recording of Transient Events (FORTE) [Kirkland et al., 2001; Suszcynsky et al., 2001] took
into account these studies and integrated a sensor designed to detect and locate lightning ﬂashes during
night and day. The ﬁrst global lightning statistics were performed using several years of OTD and LIS data.
They provided the mean global lightning reference database, its regional and temporal variability, and
the radiance distribution [Boccippio et al., 2000b; Christian et al., 2003; Peterson and Liu, 2013; Cecil
et al., 2014].
The comparison between lightning data from these experiments and ground-based lightning location
networks showed that it is not possible, from space, to uniquely determine the type of the discharge
(cloud-to-ground (CG) or intracloud (IC) ﬂashes) using only optical observations. Several simulations showed
that photons transmitted by the CG ﬂashes may not reach the cloud top because thunderclouds are too
opaque [Thomason and Krider, 1982; Koshak et al., 1994; Light et al., 2001a], suggesting that only the channels

induce channels in the upper region of the cloud [Thomas et al., 2000; Noble et al., 2004], allowing CG dis-
charges to be detected from space.

Observations previously realized from space by the DMSP satellites [Orville and Spencer, 1979; Orville and

Henderson, 1986] and the space shuttle [Vonnegut et al., 1985] provided images of illuminated thunderclouds

at nighttime with only limited spatial resolution. The U-2 airplane cameras using a narrow ﬁeld of view

[Christian et al., 1983; Brook et al., 1985; Vonnegut et al., 1989] allowed only a portion of the cloud top to be

visible but provided relevant information about the scattered light of the discharges which are produced

inside the cloud [Brook et al., 1985; Vonnegut et al., 1989]. The calculation of the photon transport inside
the cloud showed that lightning-illuminated cloud tops can be considered as Lambertian surfaces [Light
et al., 2001a]. The illuminated thundercloud can be represented by a nearly circular pattern with radially
decreasing radiance [Finke, 2009]. The mean lightning-illuminated area observed from the U-2 plane was less
than 50 km2 [Goodman et al., 1988]. Observations from the space shuttle showed that in reality this area can
reach 5000 km2 [Vonnegut et al., 1985]. The LIS and OTD experiments recorded millions of lightning ﬂashes.

Using more than 1.4 million observations made by LIS, the median and mean of the cloud top illuminated

areas are respectively 202.5 km2 and 291.7 km2 with a maximum of 7259 km2 (W. Koshak, personal commu—

nication). The median of the area over ocean was larger than over land (e.g., 267.6 km2 versus 189.1 km2,

206.4 km2 for all ﬂashes) [Peterson and Liu, 2013].

Transient luminous events (TLEs) are a class of large optical phenomena occurring over thunderstorms in the

upper atmosphere from 15 km to 100 km altitude. TLEs were classiﬁed and documented for over 20 years

thanks to many observations from ground, aircraft, or space. A ﬁrst event was observed by chance during

a low-light television camera test performed in the night for the preparation of a sounding rocket ﬂight

[Franz et al., 1990]. Ground observations were performed all around the world since 1993: ﬁrst above USA

[Sentman et al., 1995; Lyons et al., 2000] then above Japan [Fukunishi et al., 1999], Australia [Hardman et al.,

2000], Europe [Neubert et al., 2001], near China [Su et al., 2002], in the Mediterranean region [Yair et al.,

2009], and Argentina [5610 Sabbas et al., 2010]. These observations showed that TLEs are a common phenom-

enon over thunderstorms. Different physical mechanisms explain their origin [Rodger, 1999; Pasko et al., 2012,

and references therein]. The main TLE features can be summarized as follows:

1. Sprites are luminous columns from 40 to 90 km altitude triggered by a positive parent lightning (+CG).
Their lateral extension ranges from few to tens of kilometers and the emission duration varies from 1 to
10ms. The time delay between the parent lightning and the sprite extends from few milliseconds to
hundreds milliseconds. The quasi-electric ﬁeld from the parent lightning discharge could generate sprites
if the ﬂash charge moment change is sufﬁciently high [Hu et al., 2002].

2. Halos are brief and diffuse glows between 70 and 85 km altitudes with a diameter less than 100 km. A halo has
the same generating mechanism as a sprite which comes from the lightning-induced quasi-static electric ﬁeld.

3. Blue jets emerge from the cloud top at ~15 km and move upward to ~60 km altitude and even ~90 km in
case of gigantic jets. The gigantic jets show a direct path of electrical contact with the lower ionosphere.
The optical emission of a trailing jet often lasts longer than 300 ms.

4. Elves can spread over 300 km laterally at 85—95 km altitude and occur near the airglow layer altitude
[Kuo et al., 2012]. This phenomenon has very short luminous duration, i.e., typically below 1 ms.
Elves are mostly observed by photometers or by high-speed video cameras. They are induced by
lightning electromagnetic pulses which excite or even ionize the molecule at the base of the ionosphere
[e.g., Fukunishi et al., 1996].

Unfortunately, the strong atmospheric 02 absorption, the Rayleigh or Mie scattering complicates the obser-

vation of far ultraviolet/near ultraviolet (FUV/N UV) and blue light emissions. Added to the fact that clouds can

hide the TLEs, their study is difﬁcult from ground. A very good place to observe TLEs is then the space. Such
observations have been performed at the limb (MEIDEX [Yair et al., 2003], ISUAL [Chem et al., 2003; Chen et al.,

2008], and NASA Crew Earth Observations from the International Space Station (ISS) [Jehl et al., 2013]) or at

the nadir from the ISS by Lightning and Sprites Observation (LSO) [Blanc et al., 2004], by a JAXA astronaut

[Yair et al., 2013] or very recently by the JEM-GLIMS instrument [Sato et al., 2015].

In this paper, we present new observations of lightning ﬂashes, sprites, and other human-induced emissions

as large cities or gas ﬂares realized on board the International Space Station (ISS) by the ”Lightning and

Sprites Observation” (LSO) experiment [Blanc et al., 2004, 2006, 2007a]. We ﬁrst give a brief description of this

experiment and discuss its differences (advantages and limits) with other spaceborne experiments. We take
advantage of its spatial resolution (at least 400 m) which was one order of magnitude better than OTD/LIS
instrument resolution. In this way, LSO observations bring new information on dimensions and structural
details of the lightning-illuminated clouds. We discuss the possible relationship between radiance and
lightning—illuminated cloud area. We present then two methods to identify sprites. These methods require
the knowledge of the relative radiance of lightning and sprites through wideband camera and narrowband
camera at 763 nm. We apply these methods on single lightning and sprite cases. We ﬁnally show an example
of intense optical activity arising from gas ﬂares and statistics of relative radiances between both cameras.
These measurements conﬁrm that the ratio between both cameras is speciﬁc to different kind of luminous
sources and can then be used for their identiﬁcation. Such results can be useful for the future spaceborne
mission dedicated to TLE measurements.

2. Description of the LSO Experiment
2.1. LSO Purpose and Technical Description
The Lightning and Sprites Observation experiment was developed by the Commissariat a l’Energie Atomique
et aux Energies Alternatives (CEA) in cooperation with the Centre National d’Etudes Spatiales (CNES). It has
been designed to validate the sprite identiﬁcation concept for the Tool for the Analysis of Radiations from
Lightning and Sprites (TARANIS) microsatellite [Blanc et al., 2007b; Lefeuvre et al., 2008]. This space mission
will observe together at the nadir the TLEs and the Terrestrial Gamma-ray Flashes [Fishman et al., 1994].
Observations will be performed in a very broad spectral range (X and gamma rays, UV to near-infrared,
and electric and magnetic waves from DC to 35 MHz).
At the limb, TLEs are easily differentiated from lightning because they occur at higher altitude than lightning
ﬂashes. At the nadir, the differentiation is more difﬁcult because TLEs are superimposed on their parent
lightning. Blanc et al. [2004] suggested distinguishing TLEs from lightning by their spectral content. The
concept was to observe the same scene with two cameras. It was tested and validated with the LSO experi-
ment. The ”Lightning camera” measured the lightning ﬂashes, while the ”Sprite camera” was designed to
measure sprites by maximizing the contrast between TLE and lightning. Both cameras were identical (same
Charge Coupled Device and optics); a narrowband (10.8 nm) ﬁlter centered on 763 nm was added in front
of the Sprite camera optics. The bandwidth of this ﬁlter includes mainly the N2 1P (3—1) emission band
which is the most intense of the N2 1P sprite emission band [Gordillo-Vcizquez et al., 2011; Kuo et al.,
2011]. The 02 (0-0) band, around 761.9 nm with ~20 nm bandwidth, is an absorption band which damps
the lightning emissions without effect on TLEs because the damping depends on the 02 concentration
which is stronger in the troposphere than in the upper atmosphere. The average of the transmittance,
calculated with the radiative transfer MODerate resolution atmospheric TRANsmission (MODTRAN) code
[Achaiya et al., 1999], through the LSO ﬁlter bandwidth and for a nadir-viewing observation is 0.883 $0.158
for a source located at 10 km height while it is 0.999 i 0.001 for a source located at 70 km height. Lightning ﬁl—
tering is then not full. A part of the lightning emission between 757 and 768 nm [Orville and Henderson, 1984]
can be transmitted through the ﬁlter. This lightning component inside the Sprite camera has to be suppressed
in order to detect TLEs. The suppression methodology is described in the section 5 and the relative lightning
radiance inside the LSO ﬁlter is quantiﬁed.
The LSO experiment has been fully described by Blanc et al. [2004]. Main characteristics are brieﬂy recalled.
The ﬁeld of view of both CCD microcameras was 398°. The video signal was digitized with 10 bits dynamic
range. The cameras were synchronized. The images of both cameras were taken simultaneously with an inte-
gration time of 1 5. Due to a long downloading time from camera to computer (4.5 s), the effective camera
frame rate was then 1 per 5.5 s. The absolute time resolution was about a few seconds because the LSO
experiment had no GPS time stamp. The spectral range of the Lightning camera extended from 400 to
1000 nm. The central wavelength of the Sprite camera ﬁlter was 763.0 nm with a Full Width Half
Maximum of 10.8 nm (757.6—768.4). Both cameras were calibrated for quantitative measurements of
radiance [Blanc et al., 2004]. The spectral sensitivity was 45 nJ/mZ/sr for 1 LSB (least signiﬁcant bit) for both
cameras. LSO worked during 15 days from October 2001 to April 2004 (mainly during respective springs or
falls) in the framework of several European Space Agency missions. The cumulative effective time was
eventually 12.48 h. Cameras were automatically switched on when the ISS ﬂew over selected regions,

mainly continents (Figure 1) during the night, similarly to other previous TLE measurements. Each point
of the Earth, in the selected regions, was observed during 18 s on average.
2.2. Advantages and Limits of LSD
Because of the LSO integration time of 1 5, several phases of the same ﬂash (leaders, ﬁrst and subsequent
return strokes, and K and J processes) can be gathered in the same image. In comparison, OTD/LIS integration
time was only 2 ms which allows resolving individual ﬂash components. Furthermore, the low LSO absolute
time resolution prevented the comparison with ground-based observations.
The LSO sensitivity for lightning ﬂash observations was comparable to that of instruments used in previous
space missions. A lightning ﬂash is visually identiﬁable when its radiance has a signal-to-noise ratio higher
than 1 because the lightning spot spreads over a lot of pixels. As the cameras were operated inside the ISS
and the CCDs were not cooled, the CCD temperature varied from 25°C to 30°C inducing a nonnegligible dark
current and relative noise. The dark current was characterized before the launch and updated during the
ﬂight using the recorded dark images. The dark current noise is calculated as the standard deviation of the
CCD pixel amplitude of selected dark images. It was about 4.5 LSB, which corresponds to ~202 pJ/mZ/sr. By
comparison, the OTD/LIS detection threshold was 4.7 pJ/mZ/sr. But LIS and OTD observations were per-
formed through a narrowband ﬁlter of about 1 nm centered at 777.4nm while the LSO Lightning camera
was a broadband sensor. The lightning radiance at 777.4 nm contains from 5% to 10% of the whole lightning
optical energy [Orville and Henderson, 1984]. The LSO lightning ﬂash detection threshold was then 2 to 4
times higher than the OTD and LIS threshold. Only the strongest ﬂashes, which are observed by LIS/OTD,
can be observed by LSO.
The main advantages of LSD are its spatial resolution and the backup of all the recorded images without
information loss. The altitude of the ISS varied from 360 to 400 km from 2001 to 2004, and its inclination
was i51.6°. This orbit is well adapted to the observation of sprites and lightning ﬂashes which mainly occur

at low and midlatitudes. Depending on the ISS altitude, the spatial resolution changed from 360 m to 400 m
at the ground, which was, at least, 10 times larger than for OTD, LIS, or FORTE missions (i.e., 5 km for LIS
[Cecil et al., 2014], ~10 km for OTD [Cecil et al., 2014], and FORTE [Suszcynsky et al., 2001]). The camera ﬁeld
of view gave a ground area observed per each camera of 200 km x 200 km when the ISS was at 390 km
altitude (most of the images have been taken at this ISS altitude). Compared to U-2 observations, LSO
had a larger ﬁeld of view (10 km x 10 km for U-2 observations while the median lightning-illuminated area
is about 200 km2). The illuminated cloud top surface area was fully observed.
The LSO ground coverage (200 km x 200 km) and the limited number of recorded images (10.9 images per
minute) lead to a relatively weak number of lightning ﬂashes in comparison with the time of observation
(15 days). However, as LSO was able to keep all the recorded images without compression, image processing
was performed with all pixels even those with a low signal-to-noise ratio. An important LSO application,
presented in the following section, is then the full analysis of illuminated cloud dimensions and areas and
radiance variations inside a ﬂash.
3. Lightning Observations
The full LSO data set was scrupulously examined frame by frame to visually detect each lightning ﬂash. Lightning
ﬂashes differ from large cities (Figure S1 in the supporting information) or gas ﬂares (see section 5.2) because they
appear on only one frame. Fifteen images are shown in Figure 2. For each of these events, Table 1 sum-
marizes the following information: the ISS date, time, and location when the lightning occurred. During
the about 12.5 h of effective LSO nadir-viewing observations, 178 images including at least one lightning
ﬂash were detected (Figure 3a). The number of lightning ﬂashes actually observed was 197 because, in some
cases, more than one ﬂash were recorded in the same image, the duration of one ﬂash (~0.2 5) [Peterson and
Liu, 2013] being smaller than the LSO integration time. Most of the spots had circular or ellipsoidal pattern
with radially decreasing radiance as shown in images A, B, H, and M (Figure 2). Several spots can then be
included inside a large spot (E, F, G, |, J, K, L, N, and O) or appear as distant spots (C and D). These events were
rare (16 pictures from 178, Figure 3a). The 39% of single ﬂash images included more than one spot; up to six
were observed (Figure 3b). Some of these images revealed a complex ﬁlament structure (F, G, |, and J). The
ﬁlament dimensions inside the image | varied from 4 to 11 km and widths from 0.7 to 1.5 km. The ﬁlament
width was at the LSO spatial resolution limit. These ﬁlaments may be due to discharges occurring at high
altitude inside the thundercloud as commonly measured by LMA, the horizontal extension of discharges
reaching several kilometers [e.g., Thomas et al., 2000]. When they occur close to the top of the cloud, photons
are less diffused and they may be more easily detectable from space. The LSO ability to measure these events
can also be due to the long exposure duration of each image which may actually integrate several
superposed ﬂashes occurring successively in the same thunderstorm cell. The complex structures could be
a result of the scattering of light inside the asymmetrical anvil.
Figure 1 shows the spatial distribution of the lightning activity. As previously observed by Christian et al.
[2003], most of the ﬂashes occurred over continents and mainly over the tropical belt. A large ﬂash activity
was observed over America and Indonesia as expected but the activity was comparatively weak over
Africa. However, a comparison of the lightning activity observed by LIS [Cecil et al., 2014] during the LSO time
of observation explained this weakening over Africa.
4. Lightning Characteristics
4.1. Lightning Radiance, Illuminated Cloud Dimension, and Area Statistics
A systematic analysis of the 197 lightning ﬂashes observed by LSO has been performed. Typical examples are
presented in Figure 2. For each image of the Lightning camera (time integrated over 1 5), several ﬂash para-
meters were determined: the peak and mean radiances, the lightning-illuminated cloud top dimensions and
its area. The cloud top area is deﬁned by adjacent pixels which have a signal-to—noise ratio higher than 1.This
limit is shown by the black contour line in Figure 2. The mean radiance is the average of the radiance of each
pixel included in the cloud top area. The dimensions of the lightning-illuminated cloud top are calculated
assuming an ellipse shape. We then get the minor and major axes and calculate the eccentricity. The results
obtained for the 15 examples of Figure 2 are summarized in Table 1.

distances in kilometers. The colors indicate the radiance in LSB. Characteristics on each ﬂash can be found in Table 1.
The distribution of these ﬂash characteristics is represented by histograms and relative cumulative ratio in
Figures 3c—3h. The peak radiance maximum and median values were 54.27 mJ/mZ/sr and 2.75 mJ/mZ/sr,

The largest ﬂash-illuminated cloud top area was 3432.8 kmz; it corresponds to image ”0” in Figure 2. As some
of the lightning ﬂashes (~50 ﬂashes from 197) were partially outside the camera ﬁeld of view (for instance
images ”N” and ”O” in Figure 2), statistics were calculated in parallel for the whole data set and with the ﬂashes
which are not truncated. Table 2 summarizes the statistical information calculated from this data set. The median

axes were respectively 12.13 km and 15.82 km for nontruncated ﬂashes (Figures 3f and 39). The mean eccentricity
(0.6) conﬁrms that most of the ﬂashes have a slightly elongated pattern (e.g., Figure 3h). Some ﬂashes are even
more elongated (e.g., images ”,""F ”,""G or ”M”) with an eccentricity reaching up to 0.87.
These statistics are consistent with previous observations. The narrowband observations realized on board high
altitude U-2 airplane [Goodman et al., 1988] gave a mean radiance of 81 .3 pJ/mZ/sr at 777.4 nm. If we consider that
radiation at 777.4nm represents 5% to 10% of the total optical energy [On/ille and Henderson, 1984], the LSO
median of the mean radiance was of the same order of magnitude. The median value for LIS, 192.5 pJ/mz/sr/nm
(W. Koshak, personal communication), was larger than the U-2 one but the LSO observations were still in agreement
with it. Moreover, the cumulative ratio was similar to the one determined by Boccippio et al. [2000b] using the
OTD/LIS data set. The LSO ﬂash cloud top area median value is lower than the LIS one (129.56 km2 versus
206.4 km2), this is explained by the difference of their spatial resolution (0.4 km for LSO and 4 km for LIS) and ﬂash
detection threshold (2—4 times higher for LSO than for LIS).
4.2. Relationship Between Flash Characteristics
Figure 4 presents a thorough analysis of the relation between the ﬂash characteristics. Figure 4a shows that
the peak radiances increase regularly with the mean radiances (dots). They are well correlated (correlation
coefﬁcient = 84%). This could be explained by the multiple scattering of lightning photons with the particles
in the thundercloud, mostly in the upper part of anvil. We can expect a dispersion ofthe light which is similar
to a two-dimensional Gaussian function [Finke, 2009]. To test this hypothesis, the radiance of a lightning ﬂash
is modeled by the following function:
_(x_2+y_2>
R(X,y) = P><e ”X ”y ,
where X and y are the relative distances to the center of the Gaussian function in an horizontal plane, P is the
peak radiance, and 0X and 0y are the variance of R along X and y directions. The mean radiance M is the arith—
metic mean of R calculated for peak radiance varying from 0.1 to 50 mJ/mZ/sr when R is higher than a noise
threshold of 202 pJ/mZ/sr. Whatever tested 0X and 0y values for the same R area, i.e., the shape of the spot
(circular or elongated ellipse), the same results are found. The calculated mean radiances (red dashed curve)
are higher than measurements, and the difference between measurements and calculation increases with
increasing peak radiances. This means that the lightning ﬂash radiance actually decreases radially but it can-
not be exactly represented by a two-dimensional Gaussian function which overestimates the mean radiance
up to a factor 2 for the strongest events. Lastly, a good ﬁt (correlation coefﬁcient of 80.5%) is obtained for the
following power law (blue dashed curve): M=0.4363 ><PO‘4558 (P and M being deﬁned as before). The mean
radiance is thus approximatively the square root of the peak radiance.
The relationship between the peak radiance and cloud top area is also examined. Figure 4b represents the
variation of the peak radiance versus the lightning-illuminated cloud top area. Images with multiple
ﬂashes, i.e., images with two or more spots (e.g., C or D in Figure 2) or images with two or more peaks inside
the same spot (e.g., N or O), are shown with a dot while images containing only one spot (e.g., A, B, H, or M)
are indicated with a plus sign. The correlation coefﬁcient is only 68.9% for the full database, but
this coefﬁcient increases up to 86.6% for single lightning ﬂashes. The peak radiance increases with
the area, but this increase is not linear and a second order polynomial gives the best regression ﬁt

5. Relative Amplitude in the ”Sprite” and ”Lightning” Cameras
5.1. TLE Identiﬁcation Methods and Application
The second objective of the LSO experiment was to determine the relative amplitude of the lightning ﬂash
which could be transmitted through the Sprite camera ﬁlter. In nadir—viewing observations, TLE is superim—
posed on the lightning ﬂash. The lightning ﬂash component inside the Sprite camera has to be suppressed
in order to extract the TLEs. This can be done by using the lightning information provided by the
Lightning camera. The main objective of LSD was to measure TLEs and validate different differentiation
methods. Two differentiation methods were proposed: (i) making the ratio of the Sprite and Lightning images
(respectively S and L) or (ii) subtracting, pixel to pixel, the Lightning image to the Sprite image as follows:
5 — 01X L,
where a is the mean ratio of the amplitude of lightning measured in both cameras. This factor a is calculated by a
linear regression of the amplitude of pixels inside lightning ﬂash spot in both images. As a misalignment exists
between the cameras, the L image has to be ﬁrstly coregistered to avoid strong residuals. More information on
the ratio method can be found in Blanc et al. [2004]. The subtraction method was developed and tested in the
framework of the future TARANIS mission [Hébert et al., 2012]. Simulations showed that a carrot sprite, occurring
close to the edge of the ﬁeld of view, should appear with a comet shape because of the parallax, while column
sprites should appear as dashes which length is proportional to the height of the sprites and the incidence angle.
We give in this paper an example of the application of these methods using images of a sprite described by Blanc
et al. [2004] and a lightning ﬂash (image ”M” in Figure 2). One can see easily that when a lightning ﬂash occurs
without a TLE (Figure 5, top row), the S/L ratio is roughly uniform between 1 and 2%. The lightning ﬂash fully dis-
appears inside the subtraction image. Differently, when a sprite occurs, the ratio rises up to 3—4%. The sprite
clearly appears in the subtraction image as a circular spot of 5 km diameter with a maximum amplitude of 6 L58,
i.e., 270 pJ/mz/sr (or 1.3 MR at 763 nm). Both methods allow to clearly identifying the sprite from lightning ﬂashes.
Applications especially concern the location of sprites relatively to their parent lightning or relatively to other
sprites in groups of sprites. We can calculate this shift in the case of the sprite studied here. Considering the

incidence angle of sprite, <95, and of parent lightning, 6L, and assuming a cloud top altitude, hL, a sprite alti-
tude, hs, and the ISS altitude, hlss, we calculate the horizontal spatial shift ASL between sprite and lightning
as follows (Figure S6):
ASL = (hISS — hs) X tan(65) — (hISS — hL) X tan(<9L).
In the case of Figure 5 (bottom row), the sprite and the lightning are superimposed in the LSO image.
However, assuming that the incidence angles were the same and equal to 192°, hL= 10km, h5=75 km,
and hISS=390 km, we ﬁnd then a spatial shift A5L=22.6 km which suits well with previous ground-based
observation [e.g., Scio Sabbas et al., 2003] or recent ISS observations [Yair et al., 2013].
5.2. Relative Amplitude of Lightning Emissions
Figures 6a and 6b show an example of lightning observation by the Lightning and the Sprite cameras when
one of the largest and brightest lightning recorded by LSO occurred. This event did not include a sprite. The
cloud top contour, shown in Figure 6b, is determined with the Lightning camera image as deﬁned in
section 4.1 . This contour is used to calculate the mean radiance of the lightning ﬂashes inside the Sprite cam-
era image. The signal-to-noise ratio of this camera is poor, but one can see very easily that the lightning
ﬂashes observed in the Lightning camera were also present inside the Sprite camera image but with a clear
dimming. The calculation of the mean radiance of lightning ﬂashes within the Sprite camera was performed
for this event and for the whole data set. Figure 6c shows the comparison of the mean radiances calculated
both in Lightning and Sprite cameras. The studied lightning is represented by a red plus sign. We use the LSB
unit instead of radiance physical unit in this Figure because both cameras are strictly identical except the
Sprite camera ﬁlter transmission (about 73%). The comparison shows a good linear relationship between
both measurements (correlation coefﬁcient is 81%) given by the following equation (dashed line in
Figure 6): M5=0.0172><ML +0.14, where M; is the mean radiance for the Sprite camera and ML for the
Lightning camera.
The ratio between Sprite and Lightning cameras is about 1.7% for lightning ﬂashes. For verifying if this ratio is
speciﬁc to the lightning ﬂashes, we calculate it using the lightning spectra measured by Orville and Henderson
[1984] at ground level, the transmittance for different altitude of emission from 5 to 20 km, the CCD and the
narrowband ﬁlter responses (Figure S4). We found ratio values from 1.4% to 1.8%. The LSO ratio is in good
agreement with this calculation.
The scattering of the mean radiance observed in Figure 6 can be explained by the important CCD noise which
cannot fully be suppressed or by the changes in the cloud top altitude which can vary with the tropopause
FARGES AND BLANC LIGHTNING OBSERVATIONS FROM ISS 11

height from 5 km to 20 km with the observation latitude [e.g., Hoinka, 1999]. This could contribute to changes
in the ratio value because the damping of light transmitted through the Sprite camera ﬁlter would be much
weaker at 20 km than at 5 km because of the lower 02 density. The MODTRAN software used for nadir obser-
vations in a standard atmosphere showed that the difference of transmittance between these two altitudes
and through the Sprite camera ﬁlter is 10.7% (98.3% at 20 km and 87.6% at 5 km). However, the correspond-
ing ratio does not vary more than 2% within this altitude range (see Figure 55). Thus, the altitude of emission
may contribute to the observed variability but at a second order.

This demonstrates that the dispersion in the ratio determination (Figure 6) is mainly an instrumental effect of
the LSO noise and not an effect of the observation conditions. This noise will be reduced in the future
space experiments.
In order to validate, that these ratio values are speciﬁc to lightning, we also calculate the ratio for another kind
of source in the next section.
5.3. Relative Amplitude of Gas Flares Emissions
LSO instruments observed a lot of gas ﬂares. They generally appeared as dashes of 7.6 km length and 1.6 km
width (Figures 7b and 7c). The direction of the dashes follows the ISS motion. The dash length depends on
the exposure time (1 s), the ISS horizontal velocity (7 km/s), and the true source dimension. Without this
observation artifact, the source would be a spot of less than 0.8km radius (2><2 pixels). When the mean
radiance is larger than 50 LSB within the Lightning camera, gas ﬂares are simultaneously observed by the
Sprite camera. Hundreds of gas ﬂares (40% of observed dashes) were observed by both LSO cameras
(Figure 7a). As Elvidge et al. [2001] showed, they were mostly located in the Middle East and North Africa.
The mean radiance for both cameras was signiﬁcantly more important than for lightning ﬂashes
(Figure 7d). This could be due to the fact that the gas ﬂares radiate continuously during the exposure time.
Taking into account this continuous radiation inside an area of 4 pixels, the gas ﬂares median W/m2/sr, its mean
radiance 0.143 i 0.198 W/m2/sr and its maximum 1.22 W/m2/sr. Following the same procedure used for lightning
ﬂashes, we calculate the ratio between the mean radiance of Lightning and Sprite cameras. A ratio of about 4.6%
is found (M5: 0.0459><ML +0.907 with 94% of correlation coefﬁcient). Gas ﬂare spectrum can be modeled as a
black body of temperature higher than 1600 K [Elvidge et al., 2013]. We calculate the ratio in the same way as
lightning in the previous section. We take into account the radiance of a black body of 2223 K (Figure 52), which
is the temperature of pure methane burning in air [Elvidge et al., 2013]. The black body temperature mainly plays
a role in the absolute value of the gas ﬂare radiance. The calculated integrated radiance increases of about 40
between 1600 K and 2300 K. A similar variability is observed in the LSO data (Figure 7d). In this temperature
range, the Sprite/Lightning camera ratio reaches its maximum at 2200K and varies only from 4.0 to 4.6%
(Figure $3). This result is very close to the ratio measured by LSO for gas ﬂares.
This ratio is signiﬁcantly larger than the one found for lightning ﬂashes. We conclude that the 1.7% ratio
found for lightning ﬂashes is then speciﬁc to lightning ﬂashes because only very low temperature blackbody
could give such kind of ratio.
5.4. Conclusion
We described brieﬂy the two TLE identiﬁcation methods developed for LSO images. We show an example on
a sprite case. We found a horizontal shift of 22.6 km with a radiance of 1.3 MR. The mean ratio between both
cameras for the sprite event reach 4% while its mean value is 1.7% for lightning ﬂash. Such ratio value cannot
be obtained whatever is the altitude of lightning ﬂash from 5 to 20 km. The 1.7% ratio is speciﬁc to lightning
ﬂash as the comparison with gas ﬂare observation showed.
Complementary methods could be used to conﬁrm the presence of a TLE. The measurements of radiations
within 150—240 nm are a clear signature of the presence of TLEs [Kuo et al., 2005]. The space missions
GLIMS [Sato et al., 2015], ASIM [Neubert and ASIM Instrument Team, 2009], or TARANIS [Blanc et al., 2007b]
used, or will use, imagery coupled to photometry. At ground, the calculation of the charge moment change
from the ELF signal radiated by the sprite parent lightning can indicate if the regime where sprite production
is guaranteed is reached [Hu et al., 2002].
Moreover, observations by nadir-viewing cameras of sprites can bring new information about the spatial
organization of them relatively to its parent lightning.

6. Summary
We have shown in this paper a statistical analysis of the lightning ﬂashes observed by the LSO experiment.
Within 12.5 h of cumulative observation time, 197 ﬂashes were detected. The peak and mean radiance statis-
tics are in good agreement with previous observations. The main interest of LSD experiment for lightning
ﬂash studies was the spatial resolution of the lightning images associated to a large ﬁeld of view. LSO then
provided structure details for each ﬂash. Most of them looked like a two—dimensional Gaussian function with
a moderate eccentricity (being 0.6). But horizontal structures and ﬁlaments, of 4—1 1 km, were often observed
which could represent discharges located in the highest part of the thunderclouds or scattering inside an
asymmetric anvil. It is also shown that the area of the lightning-illuminated cloud top increases with the peak
radiance, but this increase is not linear. Strong lightning ﬂashes illuminate proportionally a larger area than
weak lightning ﬂashes. Finally, the lightning ﬂash radiance is actually decreasing radially. The mean radiance
is the square root of the peak radiance. We also precisely determine the relative lightning ﬂash response in
the Sprite camera, being 1.7% of the total optical energy. We show that this ratio is representative of the

lightning source spectrum and verify by comparison with other sources, such as gas ﬂare, that this ratio can
be used as a signature of different sources.

We showed that this ratio can be used to identify sprites and TLEs from lightning. This ratio reaches 4% for
sprites while this ratio is 1.7% for a lightning ﬂash. Another method is subtraction method in order to
suppress the lightning response in the sprite image. These methods need camera coregistration to strictly
compare the same ﬁeld of view. We present the example of one sprite having a horizontal shift of 22.6 km
in comparison of the lightning location and a radiance of 1.3 MR.
These results will be useful for the present and future space missions dedicated to TLE and Terrestrial
Gamma-ray Flashes nadir observations (i.e., TARANIS, ASIM [Neubert and ASIM Instrument Team, 2009], and
GLIMS [Sato et al., 2011, 2015]). Besides TLE studies, the TARANIS satellite will particularly be adapted to per-
form lightning ﬂash studies thanks to its instrument set. |ts payload includes optical instruments and different
complementary electromagnetic antennas. The optical instrument integrates two cameras (a Lightning cam-
era with a 777 nm narrow band ﬁlter and a Sprite camera with a ﬁlter similar to the LSO one) and four photo-
meters including a photodiode. The antennas will record the electromagnetic ﬁeld from few Hz to 35 MHz.
The extension of four photometers to the optical instrument in comparison with the LSO experiment will
enable (i) the temporal measurement of the variation of the signal emitted by lightning ﬂashes, particularly
the study of the scattering by the thundercloud (as discussed by Lightetal. [2001a]) or (ii) the double check of
the TLE presence thanks to the Far UV band (170—280 nm) measurements [e.g., Pasko et al., 2012]. Several
authors [Suszcynsky et al., 2000; Light et al., 2001b; Davis et al., 2002; Boeck et al., 2004] showed the value of
multiinstrumentation (for instance concurrent photometer and HF—VHF radio measurements) for lightning
studies especially in the determination of the nature of the lightning discharge (cloud-to-ground or
intracloud) which cannot be revealed by using only optical observations.
