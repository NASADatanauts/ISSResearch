Abstract
Development of HZE particle transport codes is severely required for the shielding design of spacecrafts. One-dimensional deterministic
codes are generally adopted in the shielding calculation because of their reasonable computational time, but three-dimensional Monte Carlo
codes are also to be employed especially in the ﬁnal step of the design with fully optimized geometries. We are therefore developing a general-
purpose Monte Carlo code PHITS, which can deal with the transports of all kinds of hadrons and heavy ions with energies up to 200 GeV/n.
For the purpose of examining the applicability of PHITS t0 the shielding design, neutron and Charged particle spectra inside the Space Shuttle
were calculated for an imaginary vessel whose shielding distribution is ﬁtted to that of the real shuttle. Absorbed doses and dose equivalents
were estimated from the spectra by applying ﬁuence to dose conversion coefﬁcients. The agreements between the calculated spectra 0r doses
and the corresponding experimental data were generally satisfactory, especially for the neutron spectra, which have been barely reproduced by
other studies. We therefore concluded that PHITS has a great possibility of playing an important role in the design study of spacecrafts.
