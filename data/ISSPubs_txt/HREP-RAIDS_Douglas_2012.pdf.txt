[1] We test the utility of the OH 83.4 nm emission feature as a measure of ionospheric
parameters. Observed With the Remote Atmospheric and Ionospheric Detection System
(RAIDS) Extreme Ultraviolet Spectrograph 0n the International Space Station (188),
limb proﬁles of 83.4 nm emissions are compared to predicted dayglow emission proﬁles
from a theoretical model incorporating ground-based electron density proﬁles measured by
the Millstone H111 radar and parameterized by a best—ﬁt Chapman-a function. Observations
and models are compared for periods of conjunction between Millstone H111 and the
RAIDS ﬁelds—of-View. These RAIDS observations show distinct differences in topside
morphology between two days, 15 J anuary and 10 March 2010, closely matching the
forward model morphology and demonstrating that 83.4 nm emission is sensitive to
changes in the ionospheric density proﬁle from the 340 km altitude of the 188 during solar
minimum. We ﬁnd no signiﬁcant difference between 83.4 nm emission proﬁles modeled
assuming a constant scale height Chapman-a best-ﬁt t0 the ISR measurements and
those assuming varying scale height.
