Abstract
The effect of microgravity on skeletal muscles has so far been examined in rat and mice only after short-term (5—20 day)
spaceflights. The mice drawer system (MDS) program, sponsored by Italian Space Agency, for the first time aimed to
investigate the consequences of long-term (91 days) exposure to microgravity in mice within the International Space
Station. Muscle atrophy was present indistinctly in all fiber types of the slow-twitch soleus muscle, but was only slightly
greater than that observed after 20 days of spaceflight. Myosin heavy chain analysis indicated a concomitant slow-to-fast
transition of soleus. In addition, spaceflight induced translocation of sarcolemmal nitric oxide synthase-1 (NOS1) into the
cytosol in soleus but not in the fast-twitch extensor digitorum longus (EDL) muscle. Most of the sarcolemmal ion channel
subunits were up-regulated, more in soleus than EDL, whereas Ca2+-activated K+ channels were down-regulated, consistent
with the phenotype transition. Gene expression of the atrophy-related ubiquitin-ligases was up-regulated in both
spaceflown soleus and EDL muscles, whereas autophagy genes were in the control range. Muscle-specific IGF-1 and
interleukin-6 were down-regulated in soleus but up-regulated in EDL. Also, various stress-related genes were up-regulated
in spaceflown EDL, not in soleus. Altogether, these results suggest that EDL muscle may resist to microgravity-induced
atrophy by activating compensatory and protective pathways. Our study shows the extended sensitivity of antigravity
soleus muscle after prolonged exposition to microgravity, suggests possible mechanisms accounting for the resistance of
EDL, and individuates some molecular targets for the development of countermeasures.
