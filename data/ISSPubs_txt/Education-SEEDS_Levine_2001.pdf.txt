Abstract
The J OSE (JASON Qutreach §eed Experiment) payload was the first plant study conducted
on Space Station Alpha. The experiment consisted of having an on-orbit watering of eight seed
pouches, each of which contained either siX soybean or six corn seeds glued to a germination
paper substrate. Two pouches containing corn plus two pouches containing soybean seeds
were maintained in the light after watering. Two additional seed pouches of each species were
maintained in the dark after watering. Digital photography was used to document the growth of
the germinating seedlings in space. The images were down-linked and posted to a world wide
web site for dissemination to students. Details relating to the experimental design are presented.
""Within"" species differences (between the light and dark grown seedlings) as well as ""between""
species differences (comparing corn and soybean) were observed.
Introduction
The Educational Seed Growth Kit (EDUC/SGK) Payload was initiated to support the
education obj ectives 0f the JASON Going to Extremes Proj ect. The mission of the JASON
Foundation (www.j asonproj ectorg) is to excite and engage students in grades 4—9 in science and
technology, and to motivate and provide professional development for their teachers through the
use of advanced interactive telecommunications. Kennedy Space Center (KSC) personnel
provided technical support in the development of the hardware and science protocols used to
attain the obj ectives 0f the JASON Proj ect. These efforts have been referred to as the JASON
Outreach Seed Experiment (J OSE). The experiment utilized digital photography as a means of
documenting the growth of germinating soybean and corn seeds under spaceﬂight conditions.
Daily images of the developing seedlings were down-linked and posted to a world wide web site
(www.jasonproject.0rg/jas0n11/) for dissemination to students for their evaluation. Parallel
classroom investigations were conducted by the students.
Methodology
A maximum volume of 12"" X 12"" X 5"" and a 5 lb weight restriction was available for the
experiment. A seed kit was developed which ﬁt within these constraints. It contained see-
through seed pouches (CYG Seed Germination PouchesTM) each of which contained 6 individual
seeds of either soybean (Glycine max CV McCall) or corn (Zea mays). The seeds were glued to a
germination paper substrate using a 1.2% guar glue solution. Twelve seed pouches were ﬂown,

side to facilitate photo-based data extraction. Figure 1 presents an overview of the experimental
design.

"5","For the four day (post-imbibition) soybean seedlings, the only difference evident between
those germinated under the light vs dark conditions is the slight greening up of the seeds
maintained in the presence of light (Figure 4b). The degree of root growth is comparable in
seedlings maintained under either condition (light vs dark).

Figure 5 presents representative Views of the seedlings at seven days after watering. By this
time the initial 12 mL of water added to each pouch was greatly diminished, although noticeably
less so in the soybean pouches (Figures Sc,d). This is presumably due to the faster and overall
greater growth exhibited by the corn seedlings, Which resulted in a more rapid utilization of the
available water. There is also a much more pronounced greening-up of the light-eXposed
soybean seedlings (Figure Sc) than was evident at day four (Figure 4b), With both the
cotylendons and hypocotyl regions showing signs of chlorophyll synthesis.

Conclusions
1) It is possible to design and implement relatively simple spaceﬂight experiments suitable for
Space Station Alpha implementation With signiﬁcant outreach potential.
2) There are no roadblocks to achieving normal corn and soybean seed germination in space.
3) The protocols employed in J OSE could lend themselves to relatively simple experiments
relating to the light-mediated induction of chlorophyll synthesis, phototropism,
gravitropism, and other basic plant processes.
4) Seedling growth studies using the J OSE protocols require additional water inputs if they are
to proceed past the seven day interval.
