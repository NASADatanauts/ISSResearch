characterized. It is shown that the binding of ATP and dPCoA
induces the rearrangement of a short part of the polypeptide
chain restricting the active-site cavity in the subunits of the
hexameric enzyme molecule. The changes in the quaternary
structure caused by this rearrangement are accompanied by
a variation of the size of the inner water-ﬁlled channel Which
crosses the PPAT molecule along the threefold axis of the
hexamer. The molecular mechanism of the observed changes
is described.
1. Introduction
Phosphopantetheine adenylyltransferases (PPATs) belong to
the nucleotidyltransferase 04/,6 phosphodiesterase superfamily
(Bork er al., 1995). Bacterial PPATs are involved in the ﬁve-
step biosynthesis of coenzyme A (COA) from pantothenate
(Vitamin B5), cysteine and ATP (Abkido, 1967). They catalyze
the penultimate step of this process: the reversible transfer
of an adenylyl group from ATP to 4’-ph0sph0pantetheine,
resulting in the formation of 3’-deph0sphocoenzyme A
(dPCOA; Geerlof et aL, 1999; Brown et aL, 2004). In the next
and ﬁnal step of this pathway, phosphorylation of the 3’-rib0se
hydroxyl 0f dPCoA catalyzed by dephospho—COA kinase
produces the ﬁnal product, COA. The COA-biosynthetic
pathway, Which involves several ATP molecules, is an energy-
consuming process and, as in the majority of such processes,
the key steps are regulated by a feedback-inhibition
