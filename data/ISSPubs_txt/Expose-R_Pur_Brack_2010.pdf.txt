Abstract
The ultimate goal of terrestrial planet-finding missions is not only to discover terrestrial exoplanets inside the
habitable zone (HZ) of their host stars but also to address the major question as to whether life may have evolved
on a habitable Earth—like exoplanet outside our Solar System. We note that the chemical evolution that finally led
to the origin of life on Earth must be studied if we hope to understand the principles of how life might evolve on
other terrestrial planets in the Universe. This is not just an anthropocentric point of View: the basic ingredients of
terrestrial life, that is, reduced carbon-based molecules and liquid H20, have very specific properties. We discuss
the origin of life from the Chemical evolution of its precursors to the earliest life-forms and the biological
implications of the stellar radiation and energetic particle environments. Likewise, the study of the biological
evolution that has generated the various life-forms on Earth provides clues toward the understanding of the
interconnectedness of life with its environment. Key Words: Organic molecules—Origin 0f life—Astrobiology—
