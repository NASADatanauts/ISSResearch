INTRODUCTION
This paper presents ﬁrst on orbit measured data from the Forward Technology Solar Cell Experiment (FTSCE).
FTSCE is a space experiment housed within the 5th Materials on the International Space Station Experiment (MISSE-5).
MISSE-5 was launched aboard the Shuttle return to ﬂight mission (STS-114) on July 26, 2005 and deployed on the
exterior of the International Space Station (188). The experiment will remain in orbit for nominally one year, after
which it will be returned to Earth for post-ﬂight testing and analysis. While on orbit, the experiment is designed to
measure a 36 point current vs. voltage (IV) curve on each of the experimental solar cells, and the data is continuously
telemetered to Earth. The experiment also measures the solar cell temperature and the orientation of the solar cells to
the sun. A range of solar cell technologies are included in the experiment including state-of—the-art triple junction
InGaP/GaAs/Ge solar cells from several vendors, thin ﬁlm amorphous Si and CuIn(Ga)Se2 cells, and next-generation
technologies like single-junction GaAs cells grown on Si wafers and metamorphic InGaP/InGaAs/Ge triple-junction
cells.
In addition to FTSCE, MISSE-5 also contains a Thin-Filni Materials experiment. This is a passive experiment that will
provide data on the effect of the space environment on more than 200 different materials.
FTSCE was initially conceived in response to various on-orbit and ground test anomalies associated with space power
systems. The Department of Defense (DoD) required a method of rapidly obtaining on orbit validation data for new
space solar cell technologies, and NRL was tasked to devise an experiment to meet this requirement. Rapid access to
space was provided by the MISSE Program which is a NASA Langley Research Center program. MISSE-5 is a
completely self—contained experiment system with its own power generation and storage system and communications
system. The communications system, referred to as PCSat, transmits and receives in the Amateur Radio band providing
a node on the Amateur Radio Satellite Service. This paper presents an overview of the various aspects of MISSE-5 and
a sample of the ﬁrst measured on orbit data.
THE SOLAR CELL EXPERIMENTS
A photograph of the deck that holds FTSCE is shown in Figure 1. The experiments are described in Table 1. The
primary experiments are the 3] InGan/GaAs/Ge based technologies from Spectrolab (SPL) and Emcore. In each case,
the current state-of—the-art and next generation technology are included. In addition, the Emcore ATJM devices include
the new monolithic bypass diode. The SPL panel includes two DJ InGan/GaAs/Ge solar cells that serve as control
cells. The Emcore and SPL experiments were assembled by the manufacturer according to their standard practices on
Al honeycomb substrates.
FTSCE includes several single-junction (SJ) GaAs solar cells grown on Si substrates that are representative of the
GaAs/SiGe/Si technology being developed jointly by NASA GRC, Ohio State University (OSU), and Massachusetts
Institute of Technology (MIT) [1,2]. These cells, along with GaAs/Ge control cells, are mounted on a rigid Al
honeycomb substrate. There are four 3] InGaPz/InGaAs/Ge metamorphic cells supplied by SPL that employ a
stoichonietry that results in a slightly lattice-mismatched semiconductor stack, which, in turn, results in a bandgap
combination more closely optimized for the air mass zero (AMO) spectrum. These solar cells are mounted on the SPL
panel

"2","FTSCE also includes ﬂexible, thin-ﬁlm solar cell (TFSC) technologies. The FTSCE TFSC experiments were fabricated
to mimic as closely as possible functional “ﬁrst-generation” thin-ﬁlm blanket technology. Each experiment includes
multiple, interconnected cells mounted on a lightweight array substrate. Two of the experiments incorporate amorphous
silicon (a-Si) technology. One a-Si sample utilizes monolithically-interconnected cells grown by Iowa Thin Films (ITF)
on a Kapton substrate. This unit was provided by Lockheed Martin and the Aerospace Corporation and represents a
variety of interconnect, laydown and coating techniques. The other a-Si experiment consists of a-Si material from
UniSolar grown on a stainless steel (SS) substrate using their commercial production process. The cells for this
experiment were integrated by AEC-Able Engineering using an adaptation of their UltraFleX blanket design and
represents a near—terrn attempt to “space-qualify” thin-ﬁlm cell technology when integrated into a Viable lightweight
solar array design. This sample consists of two interconnected a-Si on SS cells afﬁxed to a Vectran gore weave, which
simulates the deployed conditions on the UltraFleX array design. It will test cell-to-cell interconnects, cell-to-array
attachments and coating technology under long-term space environmental conditions.
AEC-Able/NASA Glenn also supplied a CuIn(Ga)Se2 (CIGS) experiment integrated into the same UltraFleX blanket
design as described above. This experiment consists of ﬁve CIGS cells interconnected in series using a “shingled”
approach. The CIGS cells were provided by ITN/Global Solar. It is important to note that the three FTSCE thin ﬁlm
experiments are primarily thin-ﬁlm blanket technology durability tests. The efﬁciency of some of the thin-ﬁlm devices
being ﬂown do not represent the current achievable performance of that technology and were selected because of
availability or adaptability to speciﬁc thin-ﬁlm blanket technologies.
The FTSCE includes an experiment to test the environmental durability and long-term transmittance of silicone
materials. Certain silicones are being considered for use as concentrator lens materials or coatings for advanced
photovoltaic devices, so it is critical to understand the long-term performance of these materials for such applications.
The Silicone Degradation Experiment consists of ﬁlms of silicone (DC 93-500) attached to two different solar cell
coverglasses placed over multijunction solar cells so that optical transmission (relative to the response of the M] cells)
can be monitored. Two other bare silicone samples are being ﬂown as passive experiments and will be evaluated upon
return to earth at the completion of the mission.
A passive contamination monitor is ﬂying on the FTSCE. The monitor consists of a piece of CMX coverglass mounted
such that a large surface area of the glass is exposed to the space environment. Transmission and reﬂectance
measurements were made on the glass prior to integration, and these measurements will be repeated upon return to
Earth.

THE THIN FILM MATERIALS EXPERIMENTS
A team lead by NASA Langley Research Center has transformed the outer layer of a MISSE-S thermal blanket into a
three and one half ounce experiment to evaluate the in-space survivability of 200 advanced materials that are being
developed to enable future US space missions. A photograph of the experiment blanket is shown in Figure 2. Table 2
at the end of the document gives a list of the materials, and a diagram giving the locations of speciﬁc experiments is
shown in Figure 3. The survivability of these materials Will be established by comparing pre- and post- ﬂight
characterization test data. Since these specimens Will be almost always facing the anti-solar direction When mounted on
the ISS, they Will receive very little UV radiation that can rupture chemical bonds and provide reactive free-radical sites.
They Will be subjected to thermal cycling, particulate radiation and atomic oxygen bombardment. With limited UV
exposure, all reactions that do occur Will be essentially chemically driven oxidation.

DATA ACQUISITION
The data acquisition electronics were designed and built by the NASA GRC team (Figure 4). The electronics are
mounted to the Electronics Deck, which is mounted on stand-offs on the opposite side of the Thermal Deck from the
solar cell experiments. The electronics consists of one “main” microprocessor board and nine data acquisition (DAC)
boards. The main microprocessor board provides the communications link with the communication subsystem, serves
as the command interpreter, and controls the DAC boards. In addition, the main microprocessor includes dual
redundant ﬂash memory so that not only is data transmitted to ground, but is also archived on board. Upon return to
Earth, and in the event of communication downlink failure, the mission will still have data available.

Figure 4: Photograph of the DAC boards (1-9) and
main microprocessor board (0) that perform the
FTSCE electrical measurements. The metal box in
the upper right of the photograph is the power
control unit (PCU). The metal boxes in the center
route wires from the solar cells mounted on the
opposite side and serve to maintain a Faraday cage
around the measurement electronics.
Each DAC board is approximately 4X6 in2 and is capable of measuring a 32 point IV curve on four individual solar cells,
making two temperature measurements using AD590 temperature sensors, and taking data from one sun angle sensor.
The temperature channels can be combined to measure temperature using a resistance temperature device (RTD), which
provides a wider operating range than the AD590. A single temperature channel can also be conﬁgured to make a
single IV point measurement on a cell.
The IV curve is created by using a ﬁeld-effect-transistor (FET) as a variable resistor and thereby sweeping the load
resistance while measuring the solar cell current and voltage. A comparison of data measured in a 3.1 InGaPz/GaAs/Ge
solar cell by one of the DAC boards with data measured by laboratory equipment is shown in Figure 5. These
measurements were made consecutively while the solar cell was illuminated by the X-25 solar simulator in the NRL
Solar Cell Characterization Laboratory, and the agreement can be seen to be excellent. Considering that most solar cell
NASA/CP—2007—2 14494 82

"
"5","experiments employ a bank of switched load resistors for making the IV measurement, Which requires much more space
and weight, these measurement boards are a significant improvement.

Figure 5: IV data measured on one of the
FTSCE 3J InGaP/GaAs/Ge solar cells by a

With measured by laboratory equipment.
The data acquisition software was also designed and written by the NASA GRC team. The DAC board software is
responsible for taking commands from and returning data to the main microprocessor and measuring the IV curve,
temperature, and sun angle. The software is designed to autonomously take data When user deﬁned conditions of sun
angle and temperature are met or on demand. Each DAC board can be commanded individually With a speciﬁc set of
measurement criteria granting scientists ﬂexibility in creating experimental data sets. For example, the DAC boards can
be commanded to measure data once the sun angle is below a set threshold or once the temperature has exceeded a set
threshold value.
The software resident on the main microprocessor board is responsible for receiving commands from the
communication subsystem, decoding the commands, and passing the appropriate commands to the DAC boards. The
main microprocessor software also receives data from the DAC boards, translates it into printable ASCII characters and
passes it to the communications subsystem for down-linking. The main microprocessor software must also “oversee”
the autonomous operation of the experiment, Which consists of periodically recording readings from all of the
temperature sensors to give a temperature proﬁle for the PEC during each orbit and monitoring the temperature and sun
angle data and determining if the measurement conditions have been reached.
POWER SUBSYSTEM
In sunlight the experiment is powered by an array of 4 strings of Emcore ATJ solar cells (Figure 1). Each string has 9
cells Wired electrically in series to produce an open circuit voltage (Voc) of approximately 23.09 Volts. Power from the
4 strings is fed into the Power Control Unit (PCU). The PCU distributes power to the data acquisition electronics and
the communications subsystem and regulates charge current to the battery.
When the power array is shadowed, by either the ISS itself or normal orbit eclipses, the experiment is powered by 4
high capacity (55 A-hr) prismatic Lithium Ion (Li-ion) batteries. This Will be the first ﬂight of this battery technology
and one of the ﬁrst ﬂights of a Li-ion battery system in a low Earth orbit (LEO) space environment. Lithion of
Pawcatuck, Connecticut, manufactured the battery cells. The cells are Wired together in series to provide a bus voltage
of 12.0 to 16.0 volts. The PCU uses a shunt regulator to reduce the charge current to the battery When the battery
voltage reaches 16.0 volts. An under-voltage detection circuit sheds all non-critical loads When the battery voltage
drops below 11.5 volts.
COMMUNICATIONS SUBSYSTEM
The communications subsystem was designed and built by the US Naval Academy (USNA). The system is called
PCSat2, is an Amateur Satellite Communications system similar to What it is ﬂying on PCsat
(http_://WWW.ew.usna.edu/~bruninga/pec/chops.html). The PCSat2 subsystem operates in the ITU Amateur Satellite
Service in cooperation With ARISS and provides a PSK-31 multi-user transponder, an FM voice repeater for possible
use With 188 Crew communications, and an AX.25 packet system for use as a U1 digipeater and for TNC. PCSat2 uses
the same dual redundant AX.25 command and control system as used on PCsat (NO-44) offering 8 on/off commands, 5
telemetry channels and a serial port for the FTSCE telemetry. It also supports the Digital Comms Relay support of the
PCsat2/APRS mission. The packet uplink is on 145.825 MHz and the default downlinks are in the 435 MHz band to
avoid any possible interference With existing ARISS missions. PCSat2 has quad redundant transmit inhibits for EVA
NASA/CP—2007-214494 83

"
"6","safety issues, thus it is easy to deactivate to avoid any issues With other UHF ARISS experiments that may be activated
in the future.
One of the key issues With any Amateur Radio experiments on 188 is the requirement to avoid any mutual interference
between systems. For this reason, ARISS Will need to eventually move all uplinks and downlinks into separate bands.
This is so that multiple uplinks and multiple downlinks can be going on simultaneously. As it is, With both uplinks and
downlinks on 2 meters, that band cannot be shared Without mutual interference. Thus PCSat2 is designed as With VHF
uplinks and UHF downlinks to avoid transmitting on 2 meters, even though mode B (downlinks on 2 meters) is far
superior to reaching schools and low-tech stations and meeting our mission objectives. There is much UHF equipment
being planned for 188, but until it is operational and ARISS has a long range plan, this dual frequency mode must be
used.
MISSE PROGRAM
The MISSE Program is a NASA program designed to provide access to space for new materials and devices being
considered for use in space (http://missel .larc.nasa.gov/). Experiments are placed into a Passive Experiment Container
(PEC) Which is a metal box approximately 2X2 ft2 X 4 inches thick fabricated by NASA LaRC (Figure 6). The
experiments are mounted on custom designed trays that mount Within the PEC. When closed, the PEC provides the
container for the experiments for launch on the Shuttle and transfer to the 188. For deployment, the PEC is clamped to
a handrail on the exterior of the 188 by an astronaut Who then opens the PEC to expose the experiments. After a period
of time, an astronaut closes the PEC, and it is returned to Earth allowing post-ﬂight analysis of the experiments.
ASSEMBLY OF MISSE-S WITHIN THE PEC AND DEPLOYMENT ON 188
The fully assembled MISSE-S experiment is shown in Figure 7. The FTSCE is seen on one side of the PEC, and the
Thin-ﬁlm Materials experiment is seen on the other side. Beneath the FTSCE deck are mounted the measurement
electronics and the PCU. The Thin-ﬁlm Materials experiment is attached to the thermal blanket that covers the PCSat2
transmitter, receiver, and TNC boxes. The Li-ion batteries also reside Within the side of the PEC covered by the Thin-
ﬁlm Materials experiment.
Visible at the hinged corners of the PEC under the thermal blanket are the two antenna assemblies. On deployment, the
astronaut grasps the White triangular pieces to fold the antennas into the deployed position. The “on/off’ power switch
is Visible in the cut-out of the thermal blanket near the bottom of the photograph along With the green “safe-plug” on the
side of the PEC. There is also a red “arm—plug” next to the “safe-plug” that is not Visible in the photograph. These
plugs and the switch are safety features to inhibit power from the experiment until after deployment. Once deployed,
the astronaut swaps the “safe/arm-plugs” and toggles the power switch from “off” to “on”. Upon power-up, an 8 hour
count-up timer is initiated, Which inhibits power to the PCSat2 transmitters. This allows 8 hours for the astronaut to
clear the area prior to RF transmissions, Which may interfere With the astronaut’s space suit.
The team lead by Mr. David Hess of the US Air Force Space Test Program (STP) OLAW Ofﬁce located at the J ohnson
Space Center in Houston directed and coordinated the integration and launch and is presently supporting the ongoing
operation onboard ISS and the eventual retrieval and return of MISSES.
MISSES was deployed by Astronaut Soichi Noguehi during the third space walk of STS-ll4 on August 3, 2005.
Astronaut Noguchi attached the PEC to a handrail on the top of the P6 truss, between the main ISS solar arrays. A still-
shot from the Astronaut Noguchi’s helmet camera showing him deploying MISSES is shown in Figure 8 Where his hand
is Visible grasping the PEC on the lower left corner. A photograph of MISSES deployed on the P6 truss taken from the
Shuttle is shown in Figure 9.

"8","CONCEPT OF OPERATIONS

The general concept of operations for MISSES is for PCSat2 to regularly beacon the measured data for reception by any
amateur radio station. Once received, the data packets are fed live Via the global amateur satellite ground station
network to NASA GRC Via the internet. At NASA GRC, the raw experiment packets are converted to engineering data.
These data are then transferred to NRL for analysis. The data are then distributed to the individual experimenters.
The USNA station (WB4APR — Bob Bruninga) serves as the primary command station with NASA GRC serving as the
alternate command station (KCSSRG — Phil Jenkins). The MISSES team would like to specially acknowledge the
following ground stations that currently serve as backup command stations, and without whom, this mission could not
have been accomplished:

N6CO, David G. Larsen, California backup command

G4DPZ, David J ohnson, London backup command

VKZXGJ, J ohn Simon, Australia backup command

ZLlAOX, Ian T. ASHLEY, New Zealand backup command

G6LVB, Howard Long, London backup command
In addition, the MISSES team would like to specifically acknowledge the following ground stations that have
participated in capturing the FTSCE data. Again, without their participation, MISSES could not have achieved its
current level of success.

DK3WN, N6NR, VA2LT, PDORKC, GlONC, W7DAS, KAZUPW, F6BYJ,

CTlEAT, YVSKXE, DL8DR, ZLlAOX,JA6PL, ZRlCBC, ZRlARN, GOORX,

WA4SSP, JJlWTK, W7KKE, KG4WMF, ZLlKM, P43L, N8MH, JE9PEL,

OKZAQK, IKSQLO, YV-6-PM ,KlICO, ONSPV, JN35UI, ZL3RX, WB4APR,

KCSSRG, ZL3RX, 9W2QC, HB9SKA , WB6CYP, JE4SMQ, JH4DHX,

KE6DZD, DK3TL, and VE2DWE
This concept of operations highlights how PCSat2 provides a communications system in the Amateur Satellite Service
that in turn provides an off—the-shelf solution for Telemetry Command and Control for MISSES. However, the
disadvantage of this system is the lack of complete global coverage of the ground stations. The USNA and NASA GRC
serve as primary ground stations, but this does not provide global connectivity. Therefore, it is not expected that every
data transmission will be captured in full. To compensate for this, the system is designed to make redundant data
transmissions every three minutes.
In addition to the FTSCE data, the spacecraft telemetry is also transmitted in beacon mode once every 10 to 30 seconds
again for collection Via volunteer ground stations. This live data is fed to web pages so that operators at any time can
check on the health and performance of the spacecraft. The following links are used:

FIRST ON-ORBIT MEASURED DATA

As described in the Data Acquisition section, the FTSCE electronics measure the sun angle sensors and the array of
temperature sensors distributed thought out the PEC. This is done every ten minutes to create an orbital proﬁle of
temperature and illumination across the PEC. The approximate locations of the temperature sensors attached to the
solar cell experiments are shown in Figure 11. Temperature data measured throughout September 23 are shown as an
example in Figure 10 for the aSi on stainless steel and the Emcore experiment panels along with the experiment deck
temperature. The 188 orbit places the PEC in the sun for about 60 minutes and in shadow for about 30 minutes, and this
orbital cycling can be seen in the thermal proﬁle. No FTSCE data packets containing data measured between about
2:00 and 7:30 were captured, so there is a lack of data apparent in that time frame. Each of the solar cell coupons is
thermally isolated from the experiment deck, which is evidenced in the rather large excursions in the solar cell
experiment temperatures compared to the experiment deck temperature. The TFSC experiments have much less
thermal mass than the other experiments, and as such, the aSi on stainless steel coupon temperatures are seen to cover a
wider range than the Emcore panel. A graph of the data from these three temperature sensors over the ﬁrst
approximately six weeks of orbit are shown in Figure 12, which gives an indication of the overall thermal cycling
environment that the FTSCE will experience.
NASA/CP—2007-214494 86

"
"9","As the experiment is experiencing the thermal cycling, it is also experiencing illumination cycling as shown in Figure
13. These are short circuit current data measured on two different solar cells onboard FTSCE, namely a 2X2 cm2
GaAs/Si cell and one of the 2X20m2 3J solar cells mounted beneath the silicone material experiment. These data show
how the solar cells cycle from full illumination to eclipse through the ISS orbit. These data combined With the thermal
data serve to quantify the cycling environment that the FTSCE is experiencing on orbit.

Figure 13: Short circuit current data measured on two of the FTSCE
samples showing the illumination cycling experienced by FTSCE over
the ISS orbit.
An example of measured IV curves are shown in Figure 16. These data were measured in a 3] InGaP/GaAs/Ge solar
cell, one from each of the two vendors. Measurements at different solar angles and temperatures are shown, and the
data have not been corrected to any standard measurement condition. These data highlight the high quality of data
being received. Note that the best IV curve was the most recently measured one With the smallest solar illumination
angle. These data indicate that the 3] cells are performing very well With no indication of degradation.
An example of IV curves measured in a GaAs/Si solar cell is shown in Figure 16, and an example of the IV curves
measured in the aSi on kapton module is shown in Figure 16. Again, these data show these cell technologies to be
performing quite well With no indication of degradation.

SUMMARY
This paper has given an overview and a quick look at initial data from the FTSCE onboard MISSES. The data retrieval
and analysis continue. NRL is in the process of establishing a webpage that Will display near real-time data from the
experiment along With general spacecraft telemetry information. This Will document the daily performance of the
experiment While on orbit. MISSES is scheduled to be on orbit for one year. After one year, the PEC Will be retrieved
and returned to Earth. The PEC Will be returned to NRL for de-integration. All of the solar cell technologies Will be
fully characterized. Continuous reports of the MISSES status Will be made in the upcoming PV conferences.
