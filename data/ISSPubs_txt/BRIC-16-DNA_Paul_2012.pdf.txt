Abstract
The spaceﬂight environment presents unique Challenges to terrestrial biology, including but not limited to the
direct effects of gravity. As we near the end of the Space Shuttle era, there remain fundamental questions about
the response and adaptation of plants to orbital spaceﬂight conditions. We address a key baseline question of
whether gene expression changes are induced by the orbital environment, and then we ask whether undiffer-
entiated cells, cells presumably lacking the typical gravity response mechanisms, perceive spaceﬂight. Arabi-
dopsis seedlings and undifferentiated cultured Arabidopsis cells were launched in April, 2010, as part of the
BRIC-16 ﬂight experiment on STS-131. Biologically replicated DNA microarray and averaged RNA digital
transcript profiling revealed several hundred genes in seedlings and cell cultures that were significantly affected
by launch and spaceﬂight. The response was moderate in seedlings; only a few genes were induced by more
than 7-fold, and the overall intrinsic expression level for most differentially expressed genes was low. In contrast,
cell cultures displayed a more dramatic response, with dozens of genes showing this level of differential
expression, a list comprised primarily of heat shock—related and stress-related genes. This baseline transcriptorne
profiling of seedlings and cultured cells confirms the fundamental hypothesis that survival of the spaceﬂight
environment requires adaptive Changes that are both governed and displayed by alterations in gene expression.
The comparison of intact plants with cultures of undifferentiated cells confirms a second hypothesis: undiffer-
entiated cells can detect spaceﬂight in the absence of specialized tissue or organized developmental structures
known to detect gravity. Key Words: Tissue culture—Microgravity—Low Earth orbit—Space Shuttle—Micro-
array. Astrobiology 12, 40—56.
