in the chemical formulation.

Liquid foams consist of gas bubbles which are dispersed in a Generally, foams destabilize via three different mechanisms:
liquid and usually stabilized by surface active species. They are gravity drainage that reduces the liquid fraction in the foam,
widely used, for instance in food, detergency, mineral ﬂotation and coalescence, which is the rupture of ﬁlms between bubbles, and
as precursors of solid porous materials. On the other hand, in other coarsening, which is the gas transfer between bubbles of different

, :E—r ‘ 1' The foam properties are entirely determined during the foam—

to evidence differences that could be related to the probability of
coalescence of bubbles during encounters.

We ﬁrst studied foams made with water—ethanol mixtures. We
showed that the number of bubble coalescence events during foam—
ing depends on the ethanol content. This is due to the ability
of the interface to sustain surface tension gradients during short
times. As a consequence, the bubble surfaces become partly rigid,
the drainage of ﬁlms between bubbles is slowed down (capillary—
driven, in microgravity) so bubble coalescence is prevented.
