Abstract
In osteoclastic activity during space ﬂight as well as hind limb unloading by tail suspension, inconsistent results have been reported in
an in ViVO study. The bone matrix plays an important role in the response to physical stress. However, there is no suitable in Vitro co—
culture system of osteoblasts and osteoclasts including bone matrix. On the other hand, ﬁsh scale is a calciﬁed tissue that contains oste—
oblasts, osteoclasts, and bone matrix, all of which are similar to those found in human bones. Recently, we developed a new in Vitro
model system using goldﬁsh scale. This system can detect the activities of osteoclasts and osteoblasts with tartrate—resistant acid phos—
phatase and alkaline phosphatase as the respective markers and precisely analyze the co—relationship between osteoblasts and osteoclasts.
Using this system, we analyzed the bone metabolism under various degrees of acceleration (0.5—, 1—, 2—, 4—, and 6—G) by Vibration with a
G—load apparatus. After loading for 5 and 10 min, the scales were incubated for 6 and 24 h. The osteoblastic and osteoclastic activities
were then measured. The osteoblastic activities gradually increased corresponding to 1—G t0 6—G acceleration. In addition, ER mRNA
expression was the highest under 6—G acceleration. On the other hand, the osteoclastic activity decreased at 24 h of incubation under low
acceleration (0.5— and 1—G). This Change coincided with TRAP mRNA expression. Under 2—G acceleration, the strength of suppression in
osteoclastic actiVity was the highest. The strength of the inhibitory action under 4— and 6—G acceleration was lower than that under 2—G
acceleration. In our co—culture system, osteoblasts and osteoclasts in the scale sensitively responded to several degrees of acceleration.
Therefore, we strongly believe that our in Vitro co—culture system is useful for the analysis of bone metabolism under loading or
unloading.
