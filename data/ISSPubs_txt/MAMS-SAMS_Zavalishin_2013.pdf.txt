Abstract—The results of studying Vibration microaccelerations aboard the International Space Station are
presented. The study was performed using the measurement data of the MAMS low—frequency and the
SAMS high—frequency accelerometers. For the study, siX intervals of measurements were selected, performed
in 2005. During these intervals the station was ﬂying in the standard orbital orientation, attitude control
engines were not switched on, and the crew rested. Discrete and continuous spectra were analyzed on
selected intervals. The most signiﬁcant disturbances with the discrete spectrum (cyclic trends) have been
found. Using the second order autoregression model, parameters of the most signiﬁcant disturbances with the
continuous spectrum were determined. This study was carried out as a part of the technical experiment “The
[SS environment”.
