Acknowledgements The authors greatly appreciate the support
of Dr. Taro Shimaoka, Mr. Takehiko Sone, and Mr. Toshiyuki
Tomobe for their dedicated work related to this microgravity
following the result by Furukawa and Shimada (1993) experimental project. The authors are also grateful to Dr. Paul-
Franeois Paradis for reading the manuscript.
