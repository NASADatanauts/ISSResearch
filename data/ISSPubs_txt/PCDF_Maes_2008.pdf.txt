. ABSTRACT Crystal X-ray quality is usually evaluated by looking at data quality parameters such as (relative) Wilson B—factor,
WSQWﬁiOQ, R-factors, signal-to-noise ratio, and others. As these parameters are correlated, most studies focus on one or two of them.
< i’fﬁA'sMgpart Of a study of the effects of microgravity on X-ray quality, full data sets of 35 ferritin crystals (17 PromISSv4 “space”
crystals and 18 from the ground control) were collected. Sixty-three parameters commonly used as indicative of X—ray data quality
ﬁtakenzfrom the output of the processing, scaling, and merging software packages were analyzed. This highly dimensional “quality
parame‘terﬁydataset” was reduced using a principal component analysis. About 78% of the variability in the data set could be explained
{with the ﬁrst four principal components. A score-plot in this four—dimensional space clearly showed two tendencies, one for the
t_erystals grown in space and one for the ground crystals. The differences between the two groups are observed irrespective of the
' ~:softWare package. They can be attributed to the ﬁrst principal component and reﬂect the superior quality of the space crystals.
