MATROSHKA—l and OSLDs were used for the MATROSHKA—1 experiment to measure radiation experienced

LET Spectrum quantities (differential and integral ﬂuence, absorbed dose and dose equivalent) were

measured for the different organs and skin locations of the MAROSHKA phantom using
CR—39 PNTDs and TLDs. The spectra and results can be used to determine the radiation
quantities for astronaut’s extra vehicular activity (EVA) and for the further in—depth study
of the radiation risk for astronauts. Sensitivity fading of CR—39 detectors was observed for
the MATROSHKA experiment and a practical method was developed to correct it.
This paper presents the radiation LET spectra measured with CR—39 PNTDs and the total
radiation quantities combined from results measured with CR—39 PNTDs and TLDs.
