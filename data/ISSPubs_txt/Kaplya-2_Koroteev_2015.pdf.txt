Abstract—The basic results of space tests of liquid droplet cooler—radiator models as the main elements of
frameless systems for low—grade heat rejection are considered. The studies carried out have been analyzed and
intermediate elaboration’s results are summarized, which concern (1) the development ofgenerators of drop—
let propellant ﬂows, (2) revealing an operational behavior of ﬂuid collectors of various types and analysis of
unsolved problems associated with droplet collection upon the open trajectory’s section passage, and (3) pro—
Vision of the coolant circulation contour’s closing. The necessity is substantiated for the actiVization ofworks
directed to carrying out space experiments with improved radiator models and new promising propellants in
order to provide a possibility of creating new space power plants characterized by megawatt power levels.
Keywords: frameless system for low—grade heat rejection, liquid droplet cooler—radiator, space power plant,
droplet generator, ﬂuid collector, coolant circulation contour closing
