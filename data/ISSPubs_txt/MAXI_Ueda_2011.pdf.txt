Abstract
We constructed a new X—ray (2—10keV) luminosity function of Compton—thin active galactic nuclei (AGNs) in
the local universe, using the ﬁrst MAXI/GSC source catalog surveyed in the 4—10keV band. The sample consists of
37 non—blazar AGNs at Z : 0.002—0.2, whose identiﬁcation is highly (> 97%) complete. We conﬁrmed the trend that
the fraction of absorbed AGNs with NH > 1022 cm‘2 rapidly decreases against the luminosity (LX), from 0.73 :I: 0.10
at LX : 1042—435 erg s‘1 to 0.12 :I: 0.08 at LX : 10435455 erg s_l. The obtained luminosity function was well—ﬁtted
with a smoothly connected double power—law model whose indices are yl : 0.84 (ﬁxed) and y2 : 2.0 :I: 0.2 below
and above the break luminosity, L... : 104331504 erg s_l, respectively. While the result of the MAXI/GSC agrees
well with that of HEAO—l at LX Z 1043'5 erg s_l, it gives a larger number density at the lower luminosity range.
A comparison between our luminosity function in the 2—10keV band and that in the 14—195 keV band obtained
from the Swift/BAT survey indicates that the averaged broad—band spectra in the 2—200 keV band should depend on
the luminosity, approximated by F ~ 1.7 for LX S 1044 erg s_l, while F ~ 2.0 for LX Z 1044 erg s_l. This trend
was conﬁrmed by the correlation between the luminosities in the 2—10keV and 14—195 keV bands in our sample.
We argue that there is no contradiction in the luminosity functions between above and below 10 keV once this effect
is taken into account.
