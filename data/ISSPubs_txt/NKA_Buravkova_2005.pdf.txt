Abstract
Cell-to—cell interactions play an important role in all physiological processes and are mediated by humoral and mechanical
factors. Mechanosensitive cells (e.g., osteocytes, chondrocytes, and ﬁbroblasts) can be studied eX ViVO to understand the effects
of an altered gravity environment. In particular, cultured endothelial cells (EC) are very sensitive to a broad spectrum of
mechanical and biochemical stimuli. Earlier, we demonstrated that clinorotation leads to cytoskeletal remodeling in cultured
ECs. Long-term gravity vector changes also modulate the expression of surface adhesion molecules (ICAM-l, E-selectin,
VCAM-l) on cultured ECs. To study the interactions of geterological cells, we cocultured endothelial monolayers and human
lymphocytes, immune cells and myeloleucemic (K-560) cells. It was found that, although clinorotation did not alter the
basal adhesion level of non-activated immune cells on endothelial monolayers, the adhesion of PMA-activated lymphocytes
was increased. During ﬂight experiments onboard the Russian segment of the International Space Station, we measured
the cytotoxic activity of natural killer (NK) cells incubated with labeled target cells. It was found that immune cells in
microgravity retained their ability to contact, recognize, and destroy oncogenic cells in Vitro. Together, our data concerning
the effects of simulated and real microgravity suggest that, despite changes in the cytoskeleton, cell motility, and expression
of adhesion molecules, cell—cell interactions are not compromised, thus preserving the critical physiological functions of
immune and endothelial cells.
