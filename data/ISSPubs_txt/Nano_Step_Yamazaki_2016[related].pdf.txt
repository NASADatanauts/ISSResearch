To clarify the growth mechanism of a protein crystal, it is essential to measure its growth rate with
respect to the supersaturation. We developed a compartment (growth cell) for measuring the growth
rate (<0.1 nrn s'l) 0f the face of a protein crystal at a controlled supersaturation by interferometry
over a period of half a year in space. The growth cell mainly consists of quartz glass, in which
the growth solution and a seed crystal are enclosed by capillaries, the screw sample holder, and
a helical insert. To avoid the destruction of the cell and the evaporation of the water from the
solution inside the cell, we selected the materials for these components with care. The equipment
was successfully used to examine the growth of a lysozyme crystal at a controlled supersaturation in
space, where convection is negligible because of the microgravity environment, thereby advancing
our understanding of the mechanism of protein crystal growth from solution. The technique used
to develop the growth cell is useful not only for space experiments but also for kinetic studies
of materials with very slow growth and dissolution rates (<10'3 nrn s‘l). © 2016 AIP Publishing
