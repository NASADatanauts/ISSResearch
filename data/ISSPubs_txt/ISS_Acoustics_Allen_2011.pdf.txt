It is important to control acoustical noise aboard the International Space Station (188) to
provide a satisfactory environment for voice communications, crew productivity, and restful
sleep, and to minimize the risk for temporary and permanent hearing loss. Acoustic
monitoring is an important part of the noise control process an [88, providing critical data
for trend analysis, noise exposure analysis, validation of acoustic analyses and predictions,
and to provide strong evidence for ensuring crew health and safety, thus allowing Flight
Certiﬁcation. To this purpose, sound level meter (SLM) measurements and acoustic noise
dosimetry are routinely performed. And since the primary noise sources an 188 include the
environmental control and life support system (fans and airﬂow) and active thermal control
system (pumps and water ﬂow), acoustic monitoring Will detect changes in hardware noise
emissions that may indicate system degradation or performance issues. This paper provides
the current acoustic levels in the ISS modules and sleep stations, and is an update to the
status presented in 2003. Many new modules, and sleep stations have been added to the 188
since that time. In addition, noise mitigation efforts have reduced noise levels in some areas.
As a result, the acoustic levels on the 188 have improved.

I. Introduction
THE International Space Station (188) is home, ofﬁce, and laboratory for several astronauts and cosmonauts for
time periods as long as six months. And While the crew lives and work aboard 188, it is important that the
acoustic environment allows adequate voice communications and alarm audibility, is conducive to concentration on
tasks, provides for restful sleep, and reduces the risks for temporary and permanent hearing loss. However, in order

of noise sources, e.g. fans and pumps, along with corresponding air and water ﬂows, are required and are present
within the conﬁned ISS environment, in close proximity to the crew. These competing necessities create a
challenging problem to overcome and manage.

In order to control acoustic levels on ISS, the Acoustics System, i.e. all noise sources, controls, remediation, and
monitoring, is managed by the JSC Acoustics Ofﬁce along with other teams including the ISS Acoustics Working
Group (AWG) and Multilateral Medical Operations Panel (MMOP) Acoustics Subgroup in conjunction with the
system teams which own the noise producing hardware, such as the Environmental Control and Life Support System
(ECLSS) and the Active Thermal Control System (ATCS). The AWG is an advisory group comprised of NASA
representatives from the Acoustics Ofﬁce, Space Medicine, Crew Ofﬁce, ISS Program Ofﬁce, Safety, and others.
The MMOP Acoustics Subgroup is comprised of the acoustics and audiology experts from the various international
partners including American, Russian, European, Japanese, and Canadian members.

The methods and practices used to control the ISS acoustic environment include a strong set of requirements
and veriﬁcation requirements, with noise control implemented during the design and development of the hardware,
combined with predictive analyses, testing, on-orbit acoustic monitoring, and if required, on-orbit mitigation of high
noise problems. Goodman1 describes in further detail some of the issues concerning control of noise on ISS,
including the importance of having Program and Project Management support for controlling noise levels, which is
critical.

Allen and Goodman2 describe the process of ensuring safety of ﬂight regarding acoustic levels on ISS, including
the Certiﬁcation of Flight Readiness (COFR) process. Examples of hardware noise control are discussed by
Grosveld et al.,3 Phillips and Tang,4 and by Goodman and Grosveld5 on implementation of noise control for
spaceﬂight vehicles in general.

The purpose of the current paper is to provide an updated status and documentation of the acoustic levels in the
ISS since the ﬁrst reporting of the levels in 2003 by Goodman.1 Several new rooms, i.e. modules, have been added
to the ISS, along with new sleep compartments. Also, noise remediation has been performed in the Russian
Segment’s Service Module. Finally, two examples of on-orbit noise problems and their resolutions will be
discussed. These include intra-module ventilation fan (IMV) fan clogging, and a ventilation system back—pressure
plate noise problem.

The sound pressure level(SPL) data provided in this paper were measured by the ISS on-orbit crew, using a
Bruel and Kjaer 2260 Sound Level Meter (SLM). Crew-worn and ﬁxed-location acoustic dosimeter measurements
for the current time-frame are described by Limardo.6 The acoustic instrumentation, processes, and further
discussion of acoustic monitoring aboard the ISS are described by Pilkinton.7

In 2003, the 188 US. Segment included 65
the Node 1, Airlock, and US. Lab modules.

"3","In the U.S. Lab, changes to the operational settings of the Pump Package Assemblies (PPAs) have reduced the
sound levels. Figure 2 shows the SLM measurement locations in the U.S. Lab and also the locations of the PPAs.
Each of the two PPAs includes a pump that provides cooling water for most of the hardware in the lab, one driving
the moderate temperature loop (MTL) and one driving the low temperature loop (LTL). The PPAs are located in the
aft-end of the lab, in Bay 6, and up until April 2003 were both operated simultaneously at approximate speeds of
14500 rpm (LTL) and 16000 rpm (MTL). However since 2003, the cross-over assembly that provides system
redundancy has been utilized to allow one of
the PPA pumps to drive both MTL and LTL
loops as the nominal mode of operation. This Bay 1 2 3 4 5 6
was done primarily to preserve the life of one I l l I l liigdpgéAAl
of the pumps, but also had the effect of
signiﬁcantly reducing the noise levels in the b, d _ ﬂ _ ﬂ
aft end of the lab, even though the single FWD ‘33.} “193' 1:4,3' 35' i9) ‘LZJ 1:13} AFT
pump must run at a higher speed of
approximately 18800 rpm. Figure 3 shows the LT ppA

dual-loop mode, and in the current operational
setting of single-loop mode. In Figure 3, SPL
reductions of 9-13 dB are seen in the 2 kHz
octave frequency band. Figure 2. U.S. Lab measurement locations, including location 5

Figure 4 shows the sound level and NC at the module’s longitudinal center. Locations are on the module
level at Bay 5 as afunction of time throughout centerline and 2-4 and 6-8 are also on the Bay centerlines as

aXis the conﬁguration and speeds of the PPAs
are indicated. Note that the mean NC level decreases from NC-56 to NC-52 as the PPA is switched from dual to
single-loop mode. However, there is a substantial ﬂuctuation in the NC level, most likely caused by the tonal nature
of the PPA noise, either being an unstable source, or by causing standing waves, coupled with the fact that the
measurement location is only repeatable to approximately 0.3 meters. The measurements noted with “PPA tone”
indicate where higher than usual PPA tones are present in the corresponding higher-resolution 1/3 octave band data
(not shown here).

In 2008, three government furnished equipment (GFE) racks that are part of the Regenerative ECLS system (R-
ECLSS) were temporarily added to the U. S.

Lab. The R-ECLSS provides the additional 8°

capability needed to recycle carbon dioxide — +Bay6'1/2003(D”8'PPA) I
and urine into usable air and water. The three 75 .— +Bay5'10/2008(Si“9'ePPA> I

in this Section II.

The COF and JPM, in contrast to the JLP and PMM, are laboratory modules and have a signiﬁcant number of
noise sources. Substantial efforts to reduce the noise in COF and JPM were made to the beneﬁt of the crew. With
the addition of payloads (experiment hardware), the continuous noise requirement becomes NC-52 as described in
Reference 2. However, as shown in Fig. 6, these laboratory modules are below the module-alone NC-SO
requirement. There are currently payload operations in COF and JPM, but in the future more payload hardware is
anticipated for these modules. It is expected that the noise levels in the COF and JPM will increase somewhat as
more payloads are added to these modules, however noise levels should stay below the NC-52 requirement.

Node 2 contains the crew’s sleeping quarters. As such, it is important for the noise levels to be low in Node 2.
The current sound pressure levels in Node 2 are given in Figure 7, and these levels are below the NC-SO
requirement. However, two signiﬁcant on-orbit issues caused levels in Node 2 to be higher than expected, and well
above the NC-SO requirement for a signiﬁcant amount of time. The Node 2 on-orbit issues included a noisy air
diffuser, and separately, noisy stalled inter-module ventilation (IMV) fans. In both cases, the situation was resolved.
These two issues and their resolution will be 65

111. Russian Segment Acoustic Levels

In 2003, the 188 Russian Segment (RS) included the Functional Cargo Block (FGB), Service Module (SM), and
the Docking Compartment (DC-l) modules. Since 2003, two new modules have been added to the Russian
Segment. Mini Research Module 2 (MRM2) was added in November 2009, and the Mini Research Module 1
(MRMl) was added in May 2010.

Noise levels in the FGB have been decreasing with the continued addition of stowage in the aisle-way of the
FGB. Also, three additional SLM measurement locations have been added in the FGB to better represent the
habitable volume, as is done in the other modules. Figure 11 shows the current sound pressure levels of the FGB.

The DC-l noise levels have been stable since 2003. And MRM2, a near-duplicate of the DC-l, has very similar
acoustic levels. Figure 11 also gives the sound pressure levels in DC-l and in MRM2. The levels in these modules
are fairly high with sound levels of approximately 67 dBA. However, the crew is expected to spend limited time
(less than 2 hours per day) inside these modules. Safety NCRs are in place in acceptance of these modules regarding
acoustical noise for the intended operations.

Since 2003, there has been a signiﬁcant amount of work performed to reduce the noise levels in the SM.
Beginning in 2003, as a result of a contract between NASA and Rocket Space Corporation — Energia (RSC-E), U. S.
and Russian acoustic specialists have worked together, along with the Russian Institute of Biomedical Problems
(IBMP), in an effort to bring the SM sound levels down to 63 dBA. In order to achieve these reductions several
noise producing systems were addressed; these include the ventilation, carbon dioxide removal, and air conditioning
systems. And in addition to these early activities, a longer-term activity to develop a ﬂight prototype quiet fan, as a
replacement for one fan model fan that is often used, was undertaken. These efforts are described brieﬂy below.

conducted by fans into the return—air ducts as
shown, and then by fans in the return air—duct, back to the air conditioner. Also in Fig. 12, the starboard kayuta
(sleep station) is shown. Note that ventilation in the kayuta is obtained by a fan near the middle of the SM that
draws air into a short duct, and exhausts the air into the kayuta ceiling where a large circular register distributes the
air into the kayuta. The air then eXits the kayuta through a grill in the lower portion of the kayuta door into the
working compartment. A similar but mirrored arrangement is present with the port kayuta on the other side of the
SM.

The ﬁrst priority for noise reduction in the SM was to reduce the noise levels in the kayutas. Prior to this activity,
sound levels were in the range from 62 to 66 dBA, up to 16 dBA above the 50 dBA requirement for sleep 1. Much of
the problem was as a result of the removal of the kayuta doors during Increment 1 (November 2000 to March 2001).
These doors were replaced as part of this activity.

In addition to the door replacement, several additional noise treatments were applied. The maj or source of noise
inside the kayuta was identiﬁed to be the fan directly above each kayuta in the main return air duct. Although, there
was no direct airborne connection between this fan and the kayuta, it was determined that this fan was exciting the
duct structure and the structure above the kayuta, causing the kayuta panels to Vibrate and radiate noise. To reduce
this noise, these fans (one above each kayuta) were re—rnounted using specially designed Vibration isolators
(previously they were hard—niounted), and inlet and outlet sound absorptive linings were installed inside the duct just
upstream and downstream of the fan (Fig. 13).

The second most important noise source in the kayutas was the kayuta inlet (supply) fan. To address this source,
again Vibration isolation was added, but in this case took the form of a soft duct extension, that also included some
sound absorption (Fig. 14). A fan speed controller was also added to help reduce the fan speed (at the discretion of
the crew) and corresponding sound levels. Finally, acoustic treatment (absorption and damping) was added to each
of the kayuta registers (Fig. 14).

The resulting acoustic noise reductions are provided in Fig 15a, which shows the sound levels as function of time
since the beginning of human habitation aboard the ISS (Increment 1). It can be clearly seen that noise levels were
reduced when the door on the starboard kayuta was re—installed at the end of 2005, and again when the port kayuta
door was re—installed in October 2006. The installation of the remainder of noise controls occurred during the ﬁrst
Quarter of 2007. The lowest level recorded in the kayutas was 51 dBA, compared to the 50 dBA requirement, an
overall reduction of 14 dBA from Increment 1 levels. Typical noise levels measured in the kayuta are between 52
and 56 dBA, still a signiﬁcant improvement over the previous levels. On occasion it is clear that the SLM
measurement was made with a kayuta door fully or partially open, resulting in higher than normal levels. Figure 15b

the 250 Hz octave band where there is an exceedance of approximately 6 dB in both kayutas. In order to meet the
spectral and 50 dBA Russian sleep requirements in the future, it is thought that the replacement of the fan in the
return duct above each kayuta with one of the quiet fans, described in Section 111, D, will be required.

adjacent to the working compartment).
Figure 17 shows the resulting noise reduction, ﬁrst after applying the cover, and then after applying the
supplemental mats. These data were measured without the closeout panel in order to obtain a better signal-to—noise
ratio on the source noise reduction. A sound level reduction of 9 dBA, and signiﬁcant noise reductions of at least 10
dB in the 1/3 octave band sound pressure levels above 800 Hz are observed. It is also seen in Fig. 17 that the
closeout panel provides a small amount of additional noise reduction, approximately 2 dBA.

Since the measurements were made very close to the closeout panel in Fig. 17, the noise reductions realized in
the working compartment are smaller than that shown for the isolated Vozdukh. Again, the composite noise
reductions in the SM from all noise treatments will be discussed below. Note that in Fig. 17, initial Vozdukh
microprocessor SLM measurements were made with nearby SM fans off and on. Thus, it can be seen that the tonal
peaks at 315 Hz and the majority of the acoustic energy below 160 Hz are generated by fans, and not the Vozdukh
micro—compressor.

C. Air Conditioning System (CKB)

The most signiﬁcant noise source in the forward end of the SM is the air conditioner 0r “CKB” (in Cyrillic
characters, and is pronounced “ess-ka-ve”). The CKB noise sources include a compressor, ﬂuid lines, a centrifugal
fan, and two other fans (included as part of the ventilation system discussed above) on each of the two units. The
location of the starboard CKB is shown in Fig. 12, and the port CKB is in a similar location, across the aisle-way.

Noise controls for the CKB included a cover for each unit’s compressor, and wrapping of the ﬂuid lines (Fig.
18). In addition, a cover for the centrifugal fan (not shown), and a new acoustic closeout panel (to replace a thinner
split-panel cover) for each air conditioner unit (Fig. 18) were developed and installed.

The noise reductions obtained with the new CKB acoustic closeout panel are presented in Fig. 19, which shows
sound level reductions of 5 dBA and indicates a 1/3 octave band sound pressure level reduction of at least 5 dB at
frequencies above 800 Hz.

Sound level reductions in the main cabin, including all acoustic treatments except for the quiet fans, which have
not yet been installed in the SM, are shown in Fig. 20. Since 2003, noise reductions of 3-5 dBA in the main part of
the cabin are shown. Levels are approximately 63-65 dBA, compared to a Russian Segment continuous noise
requirement of 60 dBA, and a contract goal of 63 dBA. After the noise controls were completely implemented in
early 2007, the variation (spread) in sound levels across the cabin was also reduced.

Current octave band sound pressure levels, measured in the main portion of the SM working compartment are
shown in Fig. 21. Levels at both ends of the SM are shown in Fig. 22. These levels are as high as 68 dBA near the
CKB at control point 2, and are as low as 60 dBA in the aft end of the SM. A plan View of the SM is shown inset in
Figures 20-22, showing the SM control points (labeled KT in Russian 0n plots 21 and 22).

Figure 20 shows how the noise levels in the main portion of the SM working compartment have varied over
time. The sound levels are shown to decrease by 3-5 dBA. After the noise controls were completely implemented
in early 2007, the variation (spread) in noise levels across the cabin was also reduced.

These noise reductions are seen as a signiﬁcant improvement for the crew. And, along with the signiﬁcant noise
reductions shown inside the crew’s sleep quarters (kayutas) as discussed in subsection A, the SM noise remediation
efforts have been very successful. It is hoped that with the installation of quiet fans in the SM, the noise level will
be reduced further to at least the 63 dBA goal, and possibly to the 60 dBA sound level requirement.

F. Mini Research Module 1 Noise Reductions
The Mini Research Module 1 (MRMI) is the latest module added to the Russian Segment, added in 2010.
Ground and on—orbit acoustic tests indicate that the MRMl originally produced fairly high sound levels of 73—74
dBA. This is compared to the Russian Segment requirement of 63 dBA for a module with an expected crew stay of
up to 3 hours per day. The quiet fan was intended to be used in MRMl, but these fans were not available prior to
MRMl launch, so the original fans had to be used. However, in 2011, two quiet fans were delivered to the ISS to
replace the two loudest fans in the MRMl, the heat exchanger fans, located near control points (KT) 1 and 2 in Fig.
23. These are of the higher pressure—rise type, where the use of the quiet fan is made possible by the efﬁcient
performance of the quiet fan. These replacement fans were installed in April 2011 and reduced the levels in the
zenith end of the MRMl by 5 dBA, from 73 dBA down to 68 dBA. The original MRMl acoustic levels are shown
in Figure 23, and the acoustic levels before and after the installation of the two quiet fans are shown in Fig. 24. It is
anticipated that levels will be further reduced to the requirement of 63 dBA once the remaining 3 MRMl fans (the

are scheduled to be available for ﬂight by the spring of 2012.

"17","IV. On-Orbit Acoustic Issue Resolution

Much work goes into controlling the acoustic levels in 188 modules, both by the hardware developers and the
NASA monitors. These efforts include requirements development, Acoustic Noise Control Plan (ANCP)
development, design for low noise, component noise testing, and acoustic modeling and prediction. And at the end
of the hardware development cycle, remedial actions may still be needed when ground measurements show
exceedances during veriﬁcation testing. But even after these efforts and seemingly full—proof processes, there are
still instances where unexpected acoustic issues arise on orbit. In this section, two such occurrences that affected the
overall module noise levels will be discussed, including before and after acoustic levels, and the methods of
resolution.

A. Node 2 Ventilation System Backpressure Plate Noise

During testing of Node 3, it was discovered that one of the oriﬁce plates that balanced the airﬂow between
registers of the Temperature and Humidity Control (THC) system ductwork was causing too—high noise levels, up to
10 dB above the NC—SO continuous noise requirement in the 1 kHz frequency band. Additionally, the sound pressure
levels produced by this oriﬁce plate or ‘backpressure plate’ were inﬂuenced by the position of the Remotely
Actuated Manual Valve (RAMV), which directed a portion of the THC airﬂow into an adj acent module Via an Inter—
Module Ventilation (IMV) duct. When the valve was opened, and more airﬂow was conducted into the IMV duct,
the quieter the backpressure plate became. However, the range of motion of this valve was limited, and the lowest
noise levels produced were still above NC—SO by a signiﬁcant amount. New backpressure plates were designed and
installed, with increased open area to reduce the noise levels down to the NC—SO requirement.

Before the reason for the increased Node 3 noise levels was found, there was confusion as to why the Node 3
levels were high, but the Node 2 levels met requirements, even though the design of Node 2 and Node 3 were nearly
identical. But when Node 2 arrived on orbit, and after being attached to 188, the levels inside were measured to be
well in excess of NC—SO. In fact, the octave band sound pressure levels matched the original Node 3 levels when the
Common Cabin Air Assembly (CCAA) speeds were the same.

"18","The answer was found in the reView of the Node 2 ground acoustic veriﬁcation test records, where after the test
it was discovered and documented that the position sensor for the RAMV was not reading correctly. In addition, the
software limitations that limited the RAMV position during Node 3 testing were not yet implemented on Node 2.
The result was that the RAMV had been inadvertently open during the Node 2 acoustic veriﬁcation test, causing
Node 2 acoustic levels to be lower than when in nominal conﬁguration thus passing acoustic veriﬁcation.

The ﬁnal resolution was to perform an on-orbit replacement of the backpressure plates with a set similar in
design to those that were used to ﬁx the Node 3 noise problem. This corrective action was managed by Thales-
Alenia Space International (TASI), the Node 2/3 hardware developer. Figure 25 shows the old and new
backpressure plates, and Fig. 26 shows the on-orbit measured acoustic levels before and after the plates were
installed in Node 2. Node 2 currently meets the NC-50 requirement.

B. IMV Fan Clogging

In January 2009, sound pressure levels inside Node 2 began to increase above the NC-50 requirement. The
octave band sound pressure levels were shown to match the spectral shape of the acoustic signature produced by a
stalled Inter-Module Ventilation (IMV) fan, measured during ground tests. This phenomenon also occurred in Node
1 in 2001 (Increment 2), and the issue was resolved by cleaning the lint buildup from the IMV fan’s ﬂow
straightener and upstream mufﬂer. To perform this task, however, it is required to disconnect the ductwork from the
IMV fan, a signiﬁcant crew-time expenditure.

In 2010, the problem happened again, but because of crew-time priority issues the SPLs in Node 2 kept
increasing as more lint built-up in the IMV fan inlet. After an acoustic trouble shooting session, where the SPLs
were measured at repeated locations, and different IMV fans were turned on and off to identify which IMV fan was
clogged, it became clear that at least three IMV fans were clogged, causing the fans to stall and produce high noise
levels. Also, SPLs in the usually quiet JPM increased to a level of NC-67, and levels in the forward end of the U. S.
Lab also increased 2-3 dB. In addition to acoustics issues, the stalled fans also led to improper mixing of air
between modules, thus increasing the risk for carbon dioxide pockets and reduced oxygen content in localized areas.

After discussions with the Mission Management Team (MMT), a signiﬁcant effort was made by the crew to
clean several IMV fans, including those creating high noise levels in the US. Lab, Node 2, and JPM. Figure 27
shows photographs of the clogged JPM IMV fan before and after the cleaning and also shows a photograph of the

"19","dust removed from the fan.13 As a result of the cleanings, noise levels returned to normal in the Node 2, U. S. Lab,
and JPM. Figure 28 shows the relationship between the IMV fan’s measured ﬂow rate and the acoustic levels
measured in the JPM.”

Just prior to the IMV fan cleanings in Node 2 and J PM, Node 3 began showing indications of stalling fan noise,
and this noise has been increasing over time. IMV ﬂow velocity measurements conﬁrmed that one of the Node 3
IMV fans had low ﬂow, and ﬁxed—location (static) acoustic dosimetry measurements made while each fan was
turned off and on gave extra conﬁrmation of which of the Node 3 fans was stalling. The Node 3 forward starboard
fan was cleaned and revealed a golf—ball—size dust ball on the fan’s ﬂow straightener. It is suspected that the sound
levels in Node 3 have returned to normal, but this has not yet been conﬁrmed.

The problem of dust buildup on 188 and resulting hardware anomalies is an on—going issue14 but is too broad of a
topic to discuss in detail here. Related issues include loss of smoke—detection, false low—ﬂow alarms in the CQs, and
overheating problems, in addition to the air—miXing issues discussed earlier.

To prevent the IMV fan clogging from occurring so frequently in the future, new easy—to—reach ﬁlter screens
have been proposed and may be installed in the inlet ducting of several of the IVM fans. These screens would be in
addition to the already—in—place inlet screens of relatively high porosity. The mesh size of the new screens must be
small enough to catch the lint, but large enough to avoid adding too much ﬂow resistance to the fan.

V. Conclusion

Since 2003, for a variety of reasons, noise levels aboard the International Space Station have improved
signiﬁcantly. In the U. S. Segment, many new modules have been added, and all of these meet the NC-SO
continuous noise requirement. However, Node 3 noise levels are currently higher than the continuous noise
requirement because of suspected IMV fan stalling noise. Currently, all US. Segment noise levels meet either NC-
50 or NC-52 continuous noise requirements, except for Node 3.

In the Russian Segment, signiﬁcant efforts have been made to reduce the noise levels in the Service Module,
where the crew spends a signiﬁcant amount of time every day. Noise levels in the newly added MRMl are high, but
work to reduce these levels is underway. The crew spends only up to three hours per day on an infrequent basis
inside MRMl.

With the reductions in noise levels in the kayutas of the Russian Segment, and the addition of the four new Crew
Quarters in the U. S. Segment, acoustic levels in all of the sleep stations provide an adequately quiet place to allow
the crewmember’s ears to recover from daily noise exposure. CQ levels are less than 50 dBA, and kayuta levels are
51-56 dBA.

There are still some acoustic challenges, however. In the U. S. Segment R-ECLS noise levels may need to be
remediated, depending on the results of upcoming noise measurements. In the Russian Segment, further noise level
reductions are needed in the MRMl. Payload and GFE hardware noise issues were mentioned only brieﬂy, above,

levels. Finally, on-orbit acoustic issues continue to occur but can be mitigated with appropriate attention.
