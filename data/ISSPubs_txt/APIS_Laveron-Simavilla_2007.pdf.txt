a) APIS Module 1
Module 1 has cylindrical symmetry to reproduce the case A=B
of the theoretical analysis. It is composed of a threaded main
axis, which ﬁts into the pole supports of the sphere, and two
disks. The relative position of the disks can be changed. Note
that such a design provides a body whose moments of inertia ;' t .. ,,-, ‘, H -, .
can be changed in a simple way. Both disks remain equidistant ' \V \' \‘w:\a\ ' ,

of the body. Figure 3 shows the principal axes of inertia for this ~ éknﬁﬁmzt 14’
module.
Three experimental sessions using different mass conﬁgura-
tions were conducted, and the results analysed. Speciﬁcally, the
distance between disks was set to (i) maximum, (ii) intermedi-
ate, and (iii) minimum values.

This module reproduces the case A 79 B 79 C. The main aXis is
hollowed and in the hollow there is a hinged piece, whose angle

Three experimental sessions using different positions of the

Speciﬁcally, the movable piece was adjusted to (i) the perpen-

(d) where spheres are attached to the walls of the container. ESA 1300- Ref: SSM-API-IOO (2003)
The behavior of the spheres in Figure 6(d) was due to elec-
trostatic effects that affected the motion of the spheres inside the
container in a way that we did not expect, changing the dynam-
ics of collisions between spheres and between the spheres and
the container. This effect was more important for the containers
with higher number of spheres.
Another problem we faced was that the lubricant was too Vis-
cous and the guide did not slide properly, reducing too much the
oscillation displacement. For safety reasons all the sliding parts
of the experiment had to be lubricated by a speciﬁc lubricant
but, as we received that lubricant the day before sending the
deﬁnite ﬂight hardware to the launching, we could not prove it
in advance.
In a ﬁrst design a seventh container with a liquid inside was
included in order to study the limit case corresponding to the
continuous mechanics, but it had to be removed also for safety
speciﬁcations.
As a ﬁnal conclusion we ﬁnd several improvements to be
done in a future setup. Proofs with different allowed lubricants
should be performed in advance to achieve the desired slide. An
important part of the experiment is the study of the container
with the ﬂuid; therefore a triple level of containment container
would need to be designed, to fulﬁl the safety speciﬁcations in
the 188. Finally, a study of the materials to be used would need
to be done to avoid the electrostatic forces, irrelevant in the
ground experiments but important in microgravity conditions.
6. Conclusions
This experiment qualitatively demonstrates the dependency of
the dynamic behaviour of a solid rotating body with the mass
distribution.
