Abstract
It is generally known that bone loss is one of the most important complications for astronauts who are exposed to long-
term microgravity in space. Changes in blood flow, systemic hormones, and locally produced factors were indicated as
important elements contributing to the response of osteoblastic cells to loading, but research in this field still has many
questions. Here, the possible biological involvement of thyroid C cells is being investigated. The paper is a comparison
between a case of a wild type single mouse and a over-expressing pleiotrophin single mouse exposed to hypogravity
conditions during the first animal experiment of long stay in International Space Station (91 days) and three similar mice
exposed to hypergravity (ZGs) conditions. We provide evidence that both microgravity and hypergravity induce similar loss
of C cells with reduction of calcitonin production. Pleiotrophin over-expression result in some protection against negative
effects of gravity change. Potential implication of the gravity mechanic forces in the regulation of bone homeostasis via
thyroid equilibrium is discussed.
