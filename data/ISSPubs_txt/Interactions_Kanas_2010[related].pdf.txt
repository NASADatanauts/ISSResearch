Space Slmu atlons settings completed a weekly study questionnaire that assessed mood and interpersonal
interactions using the Proﬁle of Mood States, the Group Environment Scale, and the
Work Environment Scale. The Mars 500 pilot study also directly assessed individual and
group autonomy. In these studies, high autonomy periods were those where
crewmembers planned much of their work schedule, whereas low autonomy periods
were those where mission control personnel developed the schedule, much as happens
now during actual space ﬂight conditions. Our results suggested that high work
autonomy was well—received by the crews, mission goals were accomplished, and there
were no adverse effects. During high autonomy periods, crewmember mood was
generally reported as being better and creativity was higher, but mission control
personnel reported some confusion about their work role. The crewmember group
environment in the Mars 500 pilot study was dependent on the nationality mix. Despite
scoring lower in work pressure overall, the four Russian crewmembers reported a
greater rise in work pressure from low to high autonomy than the two Europeans. In
contrast, the European crewmembers reported a greater rise in dysphoric mood in going
from low to high autonomy, whereas the Russians’ emotional state remained the same
or slightly improved. It is time to study the effects of high autonomy with larger subject
samples during actual space missions on—orbit in preparation for future exploratory
missions, where high autonomy will be the norm.
