Abstract—Phosphoribosyl pyrophosphate synthetase from Escherichia coli was cloned, purified, and crystal—
lized. Single crystals of the enzyme were grown under microgravity. The X—ray diffraction data set was col—
lected at the Spring—8 synchrotron facility and used to determine the three—dimensional structure of the
enzyme by the molecular—replacement method at 2.71 A resolution. The active and regulatory sites in the
molecule of E. coli phosphoribosyl pyrophosphate synthetase were revealed by comparison with the homol—
ogous protein from Bacillus subtilis, the structure of which was determined in a complex with functional
ligands. The conformations of polypeptide—chain fragments surrounding and composing the active and reg—

ulatory sites were shown to be identical in both proteins.
