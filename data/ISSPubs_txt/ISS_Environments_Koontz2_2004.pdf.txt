Abstract

The International Space Station (188) operates in the F2 region of Earth’s ionosphere,
orbiting at altitudes ranging from 350 to 450 km at an inclination of 51.6 degrees. The relatively
dense, cool F2 ionospheric plasma suppresses surface charging processes much of the time, and
the ﬂux of relativistic electrons is lOW enough to preclude deep dielectric charging processes
(1,2). The most important spacecraft charging processes in the ISS orbital environment are: 1)
188 electrical power system interactions With the F2 plasma, 2) magnetic induction processes
resulting from ﬂight through the geomagnetic ﬁeld and, 3) charging processes that result from
interaction With auroral electrons at high latitude.

Ironically, the cool, dense F2 plasma itself is necessary for the most important ISS spacecraft
charging process identiﬁed to date. Electrical interactions between the F2 plasma and the 160 V
photovoltaic (PV) electrical power system 011 188 can produce significant electrical potential
differences between 188 conducting structure and the surrounding ionospheric plasma, i.e. ISS
ﬂoating potentials (PP). The negative-polarity-grounding scheme utilized in the 160 V PV
power system leads naturally to negative FP values for 188 conducting structure. A negative FP
results in the application of electrostatic ﬁelds across the dielectrics that separate ISS conducting
structure from the ambient F2 plasma, enabling dielectric breakdown and arcing. Degradation
of thermal control coatings and noise in electrical systems can result. 188 is presently equipped
two plasma contactor units (PCUs), each of Which is designed to control 188 PP to within i 40 V
of the ambient F2 plasma during all phases of ISS construction and operations.

Recently, the continuing review and evaluation of putative ISS charging hazards required by
the 188 Program Office revealed that 188 charging could produce an electrical shock hazard to
the ISS crew during extravehicular activity (EVA).

"
"2","ISS charging risks are being evaluated in an ongoing measurement and analysis campaign.
The results of ISS charging measurements are combined With a recently developed model of ISS
charging (the Plasma Interaction Model) and an exhaustive analysis of historical ionospheric
variability data (188 Ionospheric Specification) to evaluate ISS charging risks using Probabilistic
Risk Assessment (PRA) methods. The PRA combines estimates of the frequency of occurrence
and severity of the charging hazards With estimates of the reliability of various hazard controls
systems, as required by NASA’s safety and risk management programs, to enable design and
selection of a hazard control approach that minimizes overall programmatic and personnel risk.
The PRA provides a quantitative methodology for incorporating the results of the ISS charging
measurement and analysis campaigns into the necessary hazard reports, EVA procedures, and
188 ﬂight rules required for operating 188 in a safe and productive manner.

Introduction
Safety and reliability engineering for manned spaceﬂight is conducted in a regulatory
environment, not unlike the regulatory environment that governs civil aviation, characterized by
rules, processes, and procedures that may be very different from those applicable to robotic space
ﬂight programs or basic space science research proj ects. The identiﬁcation, evaluation, and
management of spacecraft charging risks for the 188 Program must be accomplished in a manner
that is consistent With the regulatory environment that NASA has established for 188 design,
development, and ﬂight operations. Basic and applied science studies, ﬂight operations data, and
engineering analysis must be integrated in a balanced and obj ective manner so as to produce
safety and reliability products that enable decision-making With a high degree of confidence.
Both measurement data and engineering analysis must be subj ected to validation and veriﬁcation
processes before acceptance for use in the development of safety engineering products. The
safety and reliability products themselves are subj ect to an exhaustive programmatic review and
approval processes. Because the likelihood of occurrence of any risk or hazard can never really
be driven to zero, risk management is an essential part of the regulatory process and the question
“how much risk is acceptable?” is important, as is the question “how is the risk accepted or
declined?” Failure to integrate the science, engineering, operations, and management
components of a manned ﬂight risk assessment in an obj ective and balanced manner can be
catastrophically costly. The Columbia Accident Investigation Board Report, Vol. 1, August
2003 provides a detailed example of such a failure.
The regulatory environment applicable to the 188 Program is deﬁned in a series of Space
Station Program (S SP) documents. Copies of the subj ect documents can be obtained from the
authors on request, subj ect to US. export control regulations.

NASA Wide risk management and Probabilistic Risk Assessment (PRA) methods are deﬁned
in the NASA Headquarters requirements documents listed below. PRA methods provide a
rigorous logical and quantitative approach to answering the three most important questions that
arise in the ISS spacecraft charging risk assessment: 1) “What is the likelihood of the hazardous
condition?” 2) What is the severity of the consequences of an event caused by the hazardous
condition and, 3) “What is the likelihood of failure of the hazard control system?”

188 is pioneering the use of high-voltage, high power output, photovoltaic power systems on
large spacecraft. Spacecraft charging as a result of interaction between photovoltaic electrical
power systems With negative polarity grounds plagued early attempts to measure ionospheric
temperature and density With satellite mounted Langmuir probes (3). Therefore, the possibility
of ISS spacecraft charging hazards or risks resulting from interactions of the 160 V PV array
Electrical Power System (EPS) With the ionospheric plasma was recognized early in 188
development (4-13) and 188 is equipped With a ship set of two plasma contactor units (PCUs)
(14, 15) to mitigate any possible charging hazards.

It should be noted that negative polarity grounding of the 160 V 188 PV EPS is only one
component of the ISS spacecraft charging risk. The choice 0ftherma1 control coating on the
mierometeoroid and orbital debris (MM/OD) shields employed on the NASA, BSA, and JAXA
pressurized elements is an important factor in determining the magnitude of the possible hazards.

As an example, consider a spherical conducting structure that is 10 meters in radius (a
reasonable size compared to 188 pressurized elements). If the free space capacitance (Cfs =
4758801 = 1112 pF; 8 = dielectric constant, 80: free space permittivity) of the structure is charged
to —134 V, the stored energy is only E = 0.5CV2 = 10 micro Joules.

Covering the sphere with a thin dielectric surface coating changes the character of the
charging hazard dramatically. On the ram facing side of the sphere, the FP 0f the external
surface of the dielectric ﬁlm will approach 0 V as a result of positive charge collection from the
ionosphere, and —134 V is applied across the dielectric. NOW the sphere is best described as a
parallel plate capacitor (the conducting structure is one plate and the conducting ionosphere is
the other) able to store energy

E = 0.5 CV2 = 0.5 880(Aram/d)V2 = (0.5)(8.85 x 10'12)a(27tr2/d) V2,

"
"4","where Aram is the area of the hemisphere able to collect positive charge from the ionosphere. If (1
is 1 micron (1.3 microns is the thickness of the anodio coating on the US Lab and Node 1
meteoroid and debris shields) and a = 5 for aluminum oxide, the stored energy becomes E = 250
J oules. Now, dielectric breakdown of the thin surface coating can discharge the parallel plate
capacitor, releasing enough energy to damage the dielectric coating itself and producing enough
voltage and current to present a possibly lethal hazard to any EVA crew who may become
inserted into the discharge circuit as a result of arcing on exposed dielectrio-ooated metallic
components on the EMU suit. The high-density, low-resistanoe dielectrio-breakdown arc
plasma provides the conductive path connecting the negatively charged conducting structure to
the positively charged dielectric ﬁlm surface (5-8,11).

Note that the stored energy is inversely proportional to the dielectric ﬁlm thickness. Simply
increasing the ﬁlm thickness from 1.0 micron to 100 microns reduces the stored energy from
249.5 J oules to 2.49 J oules while greatly reducing the risk of damage resulting from dielectric
breakdown arcing and the current available for electric shock. The thick (>120 microns)
dielectric coatings on Sky Lab minimized any charging hazards that might have been generated
by the 90 V PV array on that spacecraft. Similarly, the Russian elements of ISS and the ISS
Truss Structure contribute little to the charging hazard because surface dielectric coatings are
between 10 and 100m microns in thickness.

Stored energy is also directly proportional to V2, and reducing the FP at the negative end of
the PV array to —40V reduces the stored energy to 0.9 micro J oules for the uncoated conducting
sphere, and 22 J oules for the dielectric coated sphere.

The 188 PV array design was subj eoted to extensive plasma chamber testing to assure that
PV array damage due to arcing on the array was not an issue (9,10). Additional plasma chamber
testing and analysis of structural and thermal control materials (5-8, 11) combined with the then
limited ﬂight data led to design requirements to control 188 structural ﬂoating potential to within
i40 V of the ambient plasma. More recently, the 188 PP requirement for control of the critical
arcing hazard only during nominal ﬂight operations has been changed. The new operational
requirement, approved by the 188 Safety Review Panel (SRP), is that FP shall be no more
negative than —60 V.

Two plasma oontaotor units (PCUs) designed to actively limit 188 PP to within i 40 V of the
ambient plasma, became part of the basic 188 design during 1990, thereby enabling the use of the
negative polarity EPS grounding scheme at low risk by controlling 188 PP in a single-fault-
tolerant fashion (14,15). At the time PCUs were adopted by the Program, only the critical hazard
associated with dielectric breakdown arcing of speciﬁc thermal control coatings had been
identiﬁed. Electrical interference with critical avionics and inadvertent ﬁring of pyrotechnics as
a result of surface dielectric breakdown arcing were both determined to be non-issues by the
Russian and American Programs during the course of the safety reView process before the ﬁrst
launch of 160 V PV array wings during late November 2000. Critical hazards require a single-
fault-tolerant approach to hazard control, though either a zero-fault tolerant hazard control or no-
hazard-oontrol (i.e. acceptance or the risk) are also possible after exhaustive reView and
approval of a suitable Non-Conformanoe Report (NCR). The NCR quantiﬁes the risk being
accepted and justifies the approach, as required by SSP-50021, SSP-30309, and SSP-30599.

"
"5","More recently, as a result of the continued review and assessment of spacecraft charging
risks required by the ISS Program a possible catastrophic hazard, electrical shock to ISS crew
during extra vehicular activity (EVA), was identiﬁed for the first time. ISS FF is required to be
less negative than —40 V on all EVA translation paths and work sites during EVA. Catastrophic
hazards require a two-fault-tolerant approach to hazard control, or a single-fault—tolerant hazard
control With exhaustive review and approval of an NCR that quantiﬁes the risk being accepted
and justifies the approach.

PV array driven charging is only one contributor to possible ISS FP requirements Violations.
Magnetic induction potentials resulting from the ﬂight of ISS thorough the geomagnetic ﬁeld
have been veriﬁed as an important contribution to FF as is shown in the following sections.
Additional contributions to FF requirements Violations can result of surface and structural
charging following ﬂight through auroral electron streams (16,17) though no direct observations
of such charging have been made to date. Because PV array driven charging, magnetic
induction potential charging, and auroral charging are independent processes to first order, the
FP contributions of each simply add at any point on ISS.

Identiﬁed ISS Spacecraft Charging Hazards

The expectation or observed occurrence of spacecraft charging does not, in itself, constitute a
risk or hazard requiring controls. Proper attention to electrical bonding and grounding practices
(isolation of avionics from ground plane disturbances or radiated electromagnetic interference)
during the design, development and test phase of a spaceﬂight program can effectively eliminate
spacecraft charging concerns during ﬂight operations. Adherence to the recommendations found
in NASA Technical Paper 2361, Design Guidelines for Assessing and Controlling Spacecraft
Charging Effects, (18) can eliminate most of the adverse effects of spacecraft charging events.
Space Station Program Requirements for electrical grounding requirements (S SP-3 0240 ReV. C,
Dec. 22, 1998) and electromagnetic compatibility (SSP-30423, ReV. E, June 9, 1998) assure that
critical ISS avionics and pyrotechnics are not affected by spacecraft charging and dielectric
breakdown arcing and the absence of such affects has been veriﬁed by testing. Slow degradation
of the thin anodio thermal control coatings on the NASA, BSA, and JAXA pressurized elements
as a result of dielectric breakdown arcing when FF is more negative than —60 V for long periods
of time (> 6 months) is the only critical spacecraft charging hazard identiﬁed to date.

The design of the US extravehioular mobility unit (EMU) suit does not comply With the
recommendations of NASA TP-2361, SSP-30240 or SSP-30423 as a result of necessary
functionality and performance requirements. The only electrical connection between various
large areas of partly exposed metallic conductors on the exterior of the suit is the astronaut’s
body. At the same time, stainless steel safety tethers assure that the astronaut can be grounded
to ISS conducting structure in a variety of EVA conﬁgurations. It follows that an are on one of
several dielectric coated metallic EMU components can form an expanding, high-density are
plasma that moves outward and may provide a conducting path to discharge all or part of the
NASA, BSA and or JAXA pressurized elements through the astronaut (5). The shock hazard to
EVA crew is the only catastrophic ISS spacecraft-eharging hazard identiﬁed to date. The FP
control requirement that mitigates the hazard, FP no more negative than —40 V, is a requirement

"
"6","established by NASA Flight Surgeons and is based on the minimum voltage necessary to drive a
potentially lethal current through a perspiring (perspiration is a conductive electrolyte solution
that reduces skin resistance dramatically) human being.

ISS Charging: in-Flight Observations and Data

PV array and magnetic induction driven charging of ISS has been the subj eet of numerous
published studies both before and after the activation of the ﬁrst set of 160 V PV array wings on
ISS during early December of 2000 (4-15, 19-25).

PCU emission currents have validated the occurrence of the PV array driven charging
mechanism, albeit with currents well below those expected before ﬂight. PCU emission currents
have also demonstrated the existence of substantial exposed conducting structure as a result of
current collection enabled by magnetic induction voltages in ISS conducting structure.

As discussed below, ﬂight measurement and analysis of US. Lab and Node 1 PP, with all FP
controls disabled and PV array driven charging enabled, have not been more negative than —28
volts during 2001 (19-25). Plasma chamber testing (5) has shown that the dielectric breakdown
voltage for the 1.3-micr0n thick anodie ﬁlm on the US Lab and Node 1 meteoroid and debris
shields is more negative than -60 volts. Therefore, the PCU system has not been in continuous
operation since May 2001.

The ISS FP not-to-exceed-limit for EVA safety is no more negative than —40 V, however,
and two PCUs are operated routinely during EVA in a single-fault-tolerant hazard control
strategy. A two-fault-tolerant hazard control strategy is not required at this time because a PRA,
demonstrating that the likelihood of Violating the EVA safety FP requirement is less than 10'6
until the next set of 160 V PV array wings is installed on ISS (22-24), enabled approval of an
NCR by the ISS Safety Review Panel. Floating Potential Probe measurements (19,20) were used
to develop and partly validate a new charging model of ISS (22, 23, 25), which was used in
conjunction with the recently developed ISS Plasma Environment Variability Speciﬁcation (24)
to demonstrate the very low likelihood of FF requirements Violations.

PCU Emission Current Data

PCU emission current measurements have proven valuable in characterizing PV array driven
and magnetic induction charging processes on ISS. PCU emission current from the ISS
structural ground to the ambient ionosphere is measured with an LT-1006A operational ampliﬁer
in a linear eurrent-to—voltage converter conﬁguration calibrated so that an 8 V ampliﬁer output
corresponds to 12 amps of emission current. The amplifier is digitized for telemetry by a 12-bit
analog to digital converter (with a sign bit) so that the least signiﬁcant bit corresponds to 0.004
amps of emission current. The observed baseline noise during ﬂight operations has been on the
order of i 0.005 amps with a zero offset of + 0.015 amps. Circuit analysis shows that the
current-to—voltage converter circuit should be linear over the entire range from the noise band to
12 amps.

"
"7","PCU emission current directly proportional to the net electron collection by the ISS PV-EPS
system can be observed as abrupt increases in emission current at ISS orbital sunrise When the
PV arrays are operating in sun tracking mode. Another means of measuring net PV-EPS electron
collection is available Via commanded full shunting 0f PV-array Wings. Net PV-EPS electron
collection measurements show the total amount of electron collection from the ionosphere that is
not offset by conducting structure ion collection and as such is a good relative measure of the
severity of the charging PV-EPS driven charging hazard.

Figure 1 shows measured eclipse-eXit plasma contactor emission currents since J anuary
2001. The eclipse eXit emission currents show considerable variation both during a given 24-
hour day and over the past 3 years. Large variations of Ne and Te With time of day, altitude, ISS
latitude and longitude, geomagnetic ﬁeld, solar activity, and season are expected and can explain
much of the observed variability in the eclipse eXit emission currents and the implied eclipse eXit
charging hazard. Detailed models of ISS PV array driven charging show that the magnitude of
PV-array-driven charging Will vary in a similar way With changes in the natural environment
(22-25).

The ISS PV arrays are automatically shunted Whenever the ISS batteries are fully charged
and ISS electrical loads do not demand full PV output. PV array Wing full shunts can also be
commanded from the ground. Commanding a shunt also provides a direct measure of the net PV
array electron collection that isn’t offset by ion collection by conducting surfaces. Figure 2

at the indicated GMT time. The bottom panel shows the net PCU emission current from the ISS
ground plane back to the ionosphere and including contributions from both 160 V PV array
Wings as well as ion and electron collection by ram oriented (i.e. forward facing) conducting
structure.

Figure 4: PCU emission current reductions associated With commanded shunting of PV
array Wing P6-4B. Top panel — PV array Wing angle in ISS coordinate system; Middle
panel — PV String Shunting PVCE = 0 => all PV strings shunted by command); Bottom
panel — PCU emission current from ISS ground plane back to the ionosphere. PCU
emission current contains contributions from PV array-EPS driven charging processes
as well as current collection by ram oriented (forward facing) conducting structure
biased by magnetic induction. Approximate number of un-shunted strings = 4.352 X
(PVCE error — 4.66): PVCE < 5 => commanded shunt, all strings shunted.

The 160V 188 PV array cells are able to collect electron current from the ionosphere so as to
contribute to charging hazards only When the active surface of the PV array is illuminated, not
shunted, and not facing into wake. Figures 3 and 4 both show an abrupt increase in PCU
emission current at eclipse exit (2001 88:20:04), (With an immediate small reduction in PVCE
indicating that some strings were automatically shunted) With the active surface of the arrays
facing forward, nearly perpendicular to the velocity vector. As the PV arrays track the sun past
orbital noon (2001 88:20:36) the active surface the PV arrays turn into wake and further electron

"
"11","collection by the PV array is suppressed. Beginning at 2001 88:30:00 electron collection by
forward facing conducting structure becomes prominent again as it was at eclipse eXit.

PCU emission current data needs accurate local environmental (Te, Ne) parameters
quantitative interpretation. Nonetheless, the existence of the magnetic induction and PV array
driven charging processes have been demonstrated and full wing commanded shunting and well
as wake orientation have been shown to be Viable non-PCU based charging hazard controls. The
large changes in eclipse eXit emission current, both seasonally and from orbit-to-orbit highlight
the important role of environmental variability (24) in characterizing ISS spacecraft charging
hazards. The hazards are not continuously present at a fixed level of severity and the hazards
may disappear for considerable lengths of time. Therefore, likelihood of occurrence of the
hazard as determined by PRA analysis becomes an important part of hazard characterization and
control.

Floating Potential Probe Data

The results of in-ﬂight ﬂoating potential probe (FPP) (19-25) measurements of 188 PP
characterizing both the PV array driven charging process and the contribution of the VXB'L (V =
spacecraft velocity, B = geomagnetic field, L = length of conducting structure) magnetic
induction voltages, with the plasma eontaetor system off, are shown in Figure 5 and Tables 1.

FPP measurements of 188 PP were made during several days in 2001, including intervals
when the Space Shuttle was docked to 188. On J anuary 31, FPP data measurements of 188 PP
were made with active side (the side with PV cell strings) of the active surface of the PV arrays
in shallow wake ﬂight attitude verifying that wake orientation of the arrays prevents PV array
driven charging.

With the plasma contactor system off and PV arrays sun tracking, FPP data was collected on
April 10-12, April 15, and on April 21 (before and after Space Shuttle docking). A total of 46
FP measurements characterizing PV array driven charging were made in 2001, encompassing a
wide range of ionospheric conditions. Langmuir probe measurements of electron temperature,
Te, at eclipse eXit ranged from 0.08 to 0.23 eV while electron density, Ne, ranged from 109 t0
1012/m3. To date, the observed range of PV array-driven charging FP values range from —4 t0 —
24 V. It should be noted that the FPP could not provide Te 0r Ne if Fp exceeded —10V negative
as a result of the limited range of the Langmuir probe sweep voltage.

The April 11 data is fairly typical, despite the geomagnetic storm starting about 13:30
universal time (UT). Figure 5 shows the 188 PP at the FPP measurement point as a function of
universal time on April 11, 2001. In Table 1 the total FP for the April 11, 2001 eelipse-eXit
charging peaks, shown in Figure 2, are broken down into the magnetic induction and PV array
driven components for the locations on 188 deﬁned in Figure 6.

Magnetic induction voltage is a signiﬁcant fraction of the total FP in all cases, and must be
considered in any 188 charging assessment. As shown in Figure 2, the agreement between
calculated magnetic induction voltage and measurement is excellent in all cases. Figure 6 shows
a calculated magnetic induction voltage map of 188 when passing south of Australia on April 11,

"
"12","2001. Flight south of Australia, in the ﬂight attitude indicated in Figure 6, generates the more
magnetic induction voltage on ISS than any other ISS ﬂight path.

The data shown in Figure 5 and Table 1 span 6 orbits 0r 9 hours. During that time, the
rotation of the Earth changed the geographic location of ISS eclipse eXit from near the west coast
of South America to Australia. The magnetic induction voltage peaks twice on each orbit, at i
51.6 degrees latitude. Eelipse-eXit PV array driven charging peaks are superimposed on the —
51.6 latitude magnetic induction peaks. The + 51.6 magnetic induction voltage peak occurs
during eclipse. The measured FP consists only of magnetic induction voltage When ISS is in
eclipse or when the PV arrays are shunted or in wake. When sun tracking, the active surface of
the PV arrays move into wake at orbital noon. Figure 2 also shows a comparison of magnetic
induction voltages calculated using a ﬁrst principle model (22, 23, 25) With the ﬂight data,
demonstrating excellent agreement between the magnetic induction model and the ﬂight data.
The ISS magnetic induction voltage map shown in Figure 3 was calculated using the model (22,
23,25)

High Latitude Auroral Electron Charging

The possibility of spacecraft charging by auroral electrons at high latitudes, during
geomagnetic storms or other geomagnetic disturbances, is a subject of some concern on the part
of the spacecraft charging community ( 16,17, 26-30). Analysis of historical satellite charging
and anomaly data for the United States Defense Meteorological Satellite Program (DMSP)
satellites and the European Space Agency Freja satellite both suggest that auroral charging may
be observed on 188 at high magnetic latitudes (26-30), especially at night during solar minimum.
Charging 0f the Freja and DMSP vehicles has been correlated With ionospheric plasma densities
of 104/cm2, or less, combined With ﬂuxes of energetic auroral electrons (7-10 keV) greater than
108 electrons/(cmzsec sr) (26-30). The DMSP and Frej a satellites both orbit the Earth at or
above 800 km, in the topside ionosphere, well above 188 operational altitudes. Nonetheless, the
required combinations of ionospheric plasma density and energetic electron ﬂux are expected to
occur at 188 altitudes, albeit infrequently, at or near the extreme latitudes 0f the ISS orbit (i
51.60). Inspection of the auroral precipitation maps produced hourly by the US National
Oceanics and Atmospherics Administration (NOAA) Polar Orbiting Environmental Satellite
(POES) constellation show that 188 passes through the precipitating auroral electrons several
times every day, Whenever ISS passes south of Australia at night and Kp is greater than about 4
(3 1).

The question of Whether or not ﬂight through the same kind of environment that produces
charging and the occasional recoverable anomaly 0n DMSP constitutes a risk or hazard for 188
or 188 EVA crew remains open. The absence of severe anomalies 0n the Frej a spacecraft in a
similar, if not more severe, charging environment highlight the important effect of spacecraft
design on spacecraft charging effects. More detailed assessments of the frequency of

"
"14","occurrence of the auroral charging environment at 350 to 400 km altitude as well as detailed
analysis and modeling of the expected ISS and EVA suit charging processes in that environment
are in work at this time. ISS and the EVA suits used 011 ISS are not identical to DMSP 0r Frej a,
When treated as electrical systems interacting With the auroral charging environment. Materials
properties and materials interactions With the auroral charging environment Will likely determine
the outcome of the assessments. Secondary electron yields, dielectric coating thickness
compared to energetic electron range, and total area of exposed conducting surfaces and vehicle
or subsystem capacitance are all important factors. The ISS plasma eontaetor system also
contributes to control of any auroral charging risk by both increasing local plasma density and
providing a return path to the ionosphere for any charging of ISS conducting structure produced
by auroral electrons.

During the ﬁrst two years of ﬂight (during the current solar maximum), 110 ISS equipment
anomalies have been reported that correlate With geomagnetic storms or ﬂight through either the
diffuse or Visible auroras. The ISS crews have reported ﬂying through Visible Aurora Australis
011 at least two occasions. The following excerpt from Commander William Shepherd’s deck log
of NOV. 10, 2000 is an interesting example.

“11:30: Transited through a very unusual aurora ﬁeld. Started as a faint green cloud on the
horizon, which grew stronger as we approached. Aurora ﬁlled our view ﬁeld from SM (Service
Module) nadir ports as we ﬂew through it. A faint reddish plasma layer was above the green
ﬁeld and topped oat higher than our orbital altitude. ”

Figure 3 shows southern hemisphere auroral precipitation maps produced by NOAA POES
Satellites 15 (NOV. 10, 2000 10:56 UT) and 16(N0V. 10, 2000 12:26 UT). Both NOAA SEC
satellites show auroral activity levels of 9 and hemispheric powers of 60 to 90 gigawatts,
resulting from relatively intense diffuse auroral electron precipitation over Tasmania and
southern New Zealand showing that that ISS was well Within the precipitating electron
environment during the Visible auroral are ﬂy through reported by Cmdr. Shepherd (31). Figure

Managing ISS Charging Risks: Probabilistic Risk Assessment gPRA)

The variability of the environment and the resulting variability in the severity of ISS
spacecraft charging risks as well as realistic concerns about the reliability of the hazard control
hardware leads naturally to the use of Probabilistic Risk Assessment methodology for both
assessing and mitigating charging risks.

The ISS Plasma Hazard Evaluation Process (PHEP) consists of ﬁve maj or components all of
which provide input into the PRA product.

1) The Floating Potential Measurement Unit (32) — A recently developed ﬂight instrument
designed to measure FP along With Te and Ne. The data from the FPMU is subj ect of
several stages of validation screening, beginning With parity error checks on telemetry data,
continuing With quality-of—ﬁt screening applied to the theoretical relationships to Which
ﬂight data is ﬁtted for reduction and analysis and completing With comparisons With
measurements made on other spacecraft or by ground based incoherent scatter radar
facilities. The FPMU is not used for validation of hazard control systems during EVA
because the instrument only shows that at least one hazard control is operating When the
requirement is for veriﬁcation of either a single-fault or a two-fault tolerant hazard control
system. The FPMU can and Will be used for periodic functionality checks on individual
hazard controls. The prime function of the FPMU is to provide data to validate the Plasma
Interaction Model.

2) The Plasma Interaction Model (22, 23, 25) — Simple FPMU measurements on a given day or
over a given limited time frame do not provide a reliable indication of the severity of the
hazard simply because the environmental factors causing the hazard are so variable. In order
to calculate the frequency of occurrence of FF requirements Violations a validated model
providing reasonably accurate predictions of ISS FP given ISS conﬁguration, attitude, ﬂight
path, and ﬂight environment is needed. FPMU data Will be used to validate the charging
model and only then can the frequency of occurrence of the FP requirements Violation can be

"
"16","calculated using the frequency of occurrence of the environmental conditions leading to the
Violation. If model validation is not possible then 110 relaxation of the two-fault—tolerant
hazard control based on low likelihood of FF Violations is possible.

3) The Specification of ISS Plasma Environment Variability (24) provides the likelihood of
occurrence of ﬂight environments corresponding to various levels of charging risk. The
specification is based on a critical evaluation and statistical analysis of all available satellite
and ground based data applicable to the ISS charging problem.

4) Critically evaluated and statistically valid test data (33) determining the arcing threshold for
various materials 011 the ISS outer surface and 011 the outer surface of the EMU suit are
essential for setting meaningful FP requirements needed for deﬁnition of effective hazard
mitigation.

5) Probabilistic Risk Assessment provides the methodology needed to logically characterize the
necessary and sufﬁcient conditions for a hazard to exist, evaluate the likelihood of
occurrence of FF requirements Violations, and assess the reliability of the ISS electrical
power system and command and data handling components that comprise the hazard control
system. If the likelihood of hazard control failure is low enough then a single-fault-tolerant
hazard control system can be deemed adequate for mitigation of a catastrophic hazard, even
if the likelihood of occurrence of the hazard itself is high enough to require a two-fault-
tolerant approach.

These five essential components are assembled in the PHEP to produce the hazard reports,
ﬂight rules and procedures that assure the lowest risk and highest beneﬁt for the ISS vehicle and

188 crew.
