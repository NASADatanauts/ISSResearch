Uridine phosphorylase (UDP, EC 2.4.2.3), a key enzyme in the
pyrimidine salvage pathway, catalyses the reversible phosphorolysis
correSpondence e'ma”: of uridine t0 uracil and ribose 1-ph0sphate (0r 2’ -de0xyuridine t0
tn_safonova@inbi'ras'ru 2’-de0xyrib0se 1-ph0sphate). UDP is present in most organisms
including prokaryotes, yeast and higher organisms. Its level is Often
Received 14 September 2012 elevated in tumours (Krenitsky et al., 1965; Kanzaki et al., 2002). The
Accepted 5 October 2012 amino acid sequence of UDP is highly conserved among bacterial and
vertebrate UDP (Pugmire & Ealick, 2002). Upon availability of
ribose 1-ph0sphate, UDP can also catalyse the formation of nucleo-
sides from uracil, as well as from 5-ﬂu0r0uracil; therefore, it is
involved in ﬂuoropyrimidine metabolism and, consequently, the
modulation of its enzymatic activity may have an effect on the
therapeutic efﬁcacy of these chemotherapeutic agents (Cao et al.,
2011). The substrate of UDP, uridine, is essential for RNA synthesis,
assembly of biological membranes and regulation of some biological
processes.
Uridine phosphorylase from Shewanella oneidensis MR-l
(SOUDP) consists of 252 amino acid residues and has a molecular
weight of 27 kDa. S. oneidensis MR-l is a free-living gram-negative
y—proteobacterium (Alteromonadales order) and is a facultative
anaerobe capable of surviving and proliferating in both aerobic and
anaerobic conditions. This bacterium is of interest, in particular, due
to its application in microbial fuel cells for efﬁcient electricity
generation (Lanthier et al., 2008; LOVley, 2008). The activity of
SOUDP is 2.5 times higher (Mordkovich et al., 2012) compared With
Escherichia coli UDP and is similar to that Of UDP from Salmonella
typhimurium.
Of the protein structures that have been deposited in the Protein
7 Data Bank, SOUDP has the highest identity With UDP from Vibrio
V cholerae 01 Biovar El Tor (76%, PDB code 306V, Center for Strug-
