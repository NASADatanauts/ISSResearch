Abstract. Ternary A1-6.5wt.%Si-0.93wt.%Fe alloy samples were directionally solidiﬁed
on-board 0f the International Space Station 188 in the ESA payload Materials Science
Laboratory (MSL) equipped with Low Gradient Furnace (LGF) under both purely diffusive
and stimulated convective conditions induced by a rotating magnetic ﬁeld. Using different
analysis techniques the shape and distribution of the intermetallic phase [3-A15SiFe in the
dendritic microstructure was investigated, to study the inﬂuence of solidiﬁcation velocity and
ﬂuid ﬂow on the size and spatial arrangement of intermetallics. Deep etching as well as
3-dimensi0nal computer tomography measurements characterized the size and the shape of
[3-A15SiFe platelets: Diffusive growth results in a rather homogeneous distribution of
intermetallic phases, whereas forced ﬂow promotes an increase in the amount and the size of
B—A15SiFe platelets in the centre region of the samples. The B-A15SiFe intermetallics can form
not only simple platelets, but also be curved, branched, crossed, interacting with dendrites and
porosity located. This leads to formation of large and complex groups of Fe-rich intermetallics,
which reduce the melt ﬂow between dendrites leading to lower permeability of the mushy zone
and might signiﬁcantly decrease feeding ability in castings.
1. Introduction
Aluminium—silicon cast alloys are widely used in industry due to their low densities, low cost, and
acceptable mechanical properties. The mechanical properties of aluminium alloys are, however,
adversely affected by even a small amount of iron, which leads to the formation of intermetallic
phases. In Al-Si-Fe alloys the B-AlsFeSi phase is the most harmful one (detrimental to the mechanical
properties of the alloy), which solidiﬁes as long platelets [1-4]. Insight in the three-dimensional
structure of the B-AlsFeSi phase was provided by serial sectioning [5] or X-ray computed tomography
(CT) [6]. Recent investigations demonstrate that the formation of the B-AlsFeSi phase in the
interdendritic region may signiﬁcantly reduce the melt ﬂow through the mush and therefore also
modify the secondary dendrite arm spacing [7].

One parameter used to characterize the ﬂuid ﬂow in the mushy zone is permeability, i.e. a tensor
measuring the ease of ﬂuid ﬂow through the solid network [8]. Permeability is a critical parameter for

casting models and is related to the geometry of the liquid channels and the grain morphology [9]. For
columnar dendritic structures, the permeability is anisotropic due to directional nature of the dendrite
arms [10]. To investigate the anisotropy of the permeability, Poirier [9] used a multilinear regression
analysis of experimental data to propose an empirical relationship based on the Blake-Kozeny
equation. Puncreobutr et al. [11] continued work in this area and developed an analytical expression
that takes into account the effects of intermetallic particles on permeability.

To understand the effect of convective ﬂow on the microstructure of an alloy with intermetallic
phases precipitated in the mush and to understand the effect of intermetallic phase formation on
permeability, directional solidiﬁcation experiments with a hypoeutectic Al-Si alloy enriched in Fe
under well-deﬁned boundary conditions in microgravity environment were performed in the frame of
the ESA-MAP project MICAST (Mlcrostructure F ormation in CASTing of Technical Al-Alloys under
Diffusive and Magnetically Controlled Convective Conditions) on-board the International Space
Station (188). In the ESA payload MSL LGF [12] AlSi7Fe1 alloy samples were directionally
solidiﬁed under both purely diffusive and stimulated convective conditions induced by a Rotating
Magnetic F ield (RMF). This allows for systematic studies of the impact of the solidiﬁcation velocity
and ﬂuid ﬂow on the formation of intermetallic B-AlsFeSi phase (IMP).

2. Experimental set—up and sample analysis

In the microgravity environment provided by the 188, four rod-like samples of diameter 7.8 mm and of
length 245 mm from unmodiﬁed Al-6.5wt%Si-0.93wt%F e alloy [13] were directionally solidiﬁed in
the Bridgman-type furnace insert MSL LGF (moving furnace, ﬁxed sample) [12] in the same
temperature gradient of 2 K/mm, but with different values of the furnace movement velocity:
v = 0.02 mms'1 (MICAST1#4), v = 0.04 mms'1 (MICAST1#3), v = 0.06 mms'1 (MICAST1#2 ) and
V = 0.08 mms'1 (MICAST1#1). After a certain solidiﬁed length (50 mm on average), which may allow
for a steady-state columnar growth under diffusive conditions, the rotating magnetic ﬁeld (RMF) was
switched on. The operating frequency of 57 Hz and the magnetic ﬁeld strength of 5.7 mT are
sufﬁcient to induce forced melt ﬂow in the melt.

Axial cross-sections of the samples were investigated to determine the distribution of the
intermetallic B-AlsFeSi phase in 2D. To allow for an unambiguous identiﬁcation of the B-AlsFeSi
phases a special preparation technique with a basic ﬁnal polishing step was developed. As a result the
B-AlsFeSi phases appear in an intense dark colour with respect to the primary Ot-Al phase and the
Al-Si eutectic. Digital image analysis was used for binarization 0f the images. The B-AlsFeSi phases
could be identiﬁed automatically and a detailed analysis of the size and distributions of the phases was
performed. F igure 1 shows as an example the B-AlsFeSi phases for MICAST1#4 sample classiﬁed in
groups of different lengths, determined with image analysis using the F eret-maXimum value.

For the 3D CT analysis of the intermetallic phases samples of dimension 1X1X8mm normal to the
growth direction of the sample rod (8 mm in diameter) were prepared. The scans were carried out in
the X-ray tomography system Phoenix nanotom® (Phoenix |X-Ray GmbH) available at DLR. The
nanofocus X-ray tube coupled with a 2304><2304 pixel detector produces a volume of
2304 X 2304 X 2304 voxels. The magniﬁcation was chosen such that an effective pixel size of 1.0 pm
is obtained. A total of 800 radiographs during 360 degree of sample rotation were acquired at a tension
of 100 kV and a current of 135 [1A. Image corrections and ring artifact corrections were applied before
the ﬁnal reconstruction. After image acquisition, signiﬁcant post-processing was necessary to
segment the three phases: primary oc-Al, intermetallics, and eutectic. From these images, tomographic
3D-Volumes of 1000 X 1000 X 1000 voxels with a voxel size of 1.0 pm were generated (datoslx—
reconstruction software, GE Sensing and Inspection GmbH) for each prepared sample segment. One
reconstruction cube was chosen in the sample center and one was chosen at the outer part of the
sample. Further image analysis was performed using AVizoFire 8.1. An example of the results is
shown in ﬁgure 2: The B-AlsFeSi phases form a complex and interconnected network.

tomographic datasets for ﬂow predictions. The ﬂow studies were performed in each of the three
directions along the X, y and z axes of the 3D-Volume. Inlet ﬂow along the z-aXis gives the
permeability for liquid ﬂow parallel to the primary dendrite arms, while permeability in the normal
direction was taken as the value calculated with inlet ﬂows along the X- and y-axes. The boundary
conditions were: free pressure outlet, no-slip conditions, liquid Viscosity was given a value of
0.00125Pa s.
3. Results and Discussion
3.1. 2D-analysis
Based on aXial 2D cross-sections obtained from regions of pure diffusive growth and also from
regions solidiﬁed with forced melt ﬂow, the sizes and distribution of B-AlsFeSi phases were
determined for different solidiﬁcation velocities (ﬁgure 1). In the diffusive case [14] the phases are
larger and more homogeneously distributed than in the case of induced melt ﬂow. In general, the size
of the B-AlsFeSi phases growing in the interdendritic region is limited by the spacing of the dendritic
area and the total amount of Fe available for formation of the intermetallic phase. The RMF induced a
secondary melt ﬂow [15], which results in an enrichment of Si and Fe in the centre part of the samples
due to strong macrosegregation. Therefore, especially for lower solidiﬁcation velocities (ﬁgure 2,
bottom left), the enrichment of Si and Fe in the sample centre part results in a few but rather large
B-AlsFeSi particles.
3.2. 3D-analysis
As seen in ﬁgure 2 the intermetallics are large and plate-like. They form a complex and interconnected
network. It is immediately clear that they are able to block ﬂow through the interdendritic network of
channels (‘barrier effect’). The volume fraction of the B-AlsFeSi phase measured for the different
samples (solidiﬁed with RMF, outer part of the sample) compared to the calculated one (dashed line)
is shown in ﬁgure 3. The decrease of the volume fraction at 0.02 mms'1 and the increase at 0.08 mms'1
can be explained by the local decrease and increase of the Fe content as measured by SEM EBSD
microprobe analysis, respectively.

The calculated permeability value (z-direction; MICAST1#2) has been ﬁtted (ﬁgure 5) to an
empirical relationship based on the Blake-Kozeny equation following the procedure of Poirier [9] and
Puncreobutr [11] With an additional term, l-ﬂfIMp, Where ,8 represents the impact factor of the
intermetallic phase:

Kp = (1 - ﬂszP) Kporlg (1)
Kpmg = C1 (ff 112M] -fz) (2)
Where Kp is the permeability in the direction parallel to the primary dendrites, Kporlg is the original
expression of Poirier [9], 11 is the primary dendrite spacing, f; is the liquid volume fraction and C1 is a
ﬁtting constant. The values for f; and ﬁMp were obtained from thermodynamic calculations With a
linearized phase diagram [16]. It can be seen that in the ﬁrst solidiﬁcation phase the permeability
decreases monotonically With temperature as expected because of the thickening of the primary
dendrites as solidiﬁcation progresses. The permeability is signiﬁcantly lower for the case With ﬂuid
ﬂow as compared to the one Without, because of the reduced primary dendrite spacing. During the
solidiﬁcation phase, after the beginning of intermetallic phase precipitation, the loss of permeability
that occurs due to the intermetallic phases can be directly attributed to the barrier effect of the
B-AlsFeSi phases. A further analysis is ongoing, trying to answer the question, Why the effect is not
bigger (grid size of the AVizo model etc.).

4. Conclusions
This paper provides an analysis of the formation of intermetallic phases in AISi7Fe1 alloy in samples
processed onboard the 188. Based on the aXial 2D cross-sections obtained from regions of purely
diffusive growth and also from regions solidiﬁed under forced melt ﬂow, the sizes and distribution of
B-AlsFeSi phases were determined for different solidiﬁcation velocities. In the diffusive case the
phases are larger and more homogeneously distributed than in the case of induced melt ﬂow.
Especially for lower solidiﬁcation velocities, the enrichment of Si and Fe in the centre part of the
sample by ﬂuid ﬂow results in only a few but rather large B-AlsFeSi platelets.

The coupling of the 3D CT analysis of the structure of the B-AlsFeSi particles, With numerical
simulations demonstrates qualitatively the blocking effect of intermetallics 0n ﬂuid ﬂow and the loss
in permeability in the direction parallel to the primary dendrites. This can explain the decrease in the
feeding abilities in castings and could therefore explain the increased susceptibility of such alloys for
casting defects as hot tearing and microporosity.
