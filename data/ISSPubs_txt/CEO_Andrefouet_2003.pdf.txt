Influence of the spatlal resolutlon of SeaWIFS,

Statlon data on estlmates of landscape
parameters of PaCIfIC Ocean atolls

Abstract. Perimeter, surface area, total hydrodynamic aperture, and degree of hydrodynamic aperture are key landscape
parameters used to quantify differences in the biological functioning of Tuamotu Archipelago atolls (French Polynesia). In a
previous study, these landscape parameters were computed using Satellite pour 1’0bservati0n de la terre (SPOT) high—
resolution Visible (HRV) data at 20 In spatial resolution. Since 1999, Tuamotu atolls have been systematically imaged by an
array of satellite sensors With a Wide range of spatial resolution (from 1 km to 5 In) including the sea—Viewing Wide field—Of—
View sensor (SeaWiFS), Landsat enhanced thematic mapper plus (ETM+), and digital photographs taken by astronauts from
the International Space Station (188). Our goal was to assess the inﬂuence of the spatial resolution of SeaWiFS (1 km),
ETM+ (30 In), HRV (20 In), and 188 digital photographs (5 In) on the estimation of landscape parameters of Pacific Ocean
atolls. Total hydrodynamic aperture and degree of hydrodynamic aperture are the parameters most sensitive to variation in
resolution. For the same atoll, the differences between degree of aperture computed from SPOT and Landsat can reach 28%.
Conversely, perimeters and atoll surface area estimates are in agreement Within 7% using data With resolution from 5 to
30 In. One kilometre resolution SeaWiFS data Offer the possibility to rank atolls based on surface area correctly, but only for
atolls larger than 70 kmz.
