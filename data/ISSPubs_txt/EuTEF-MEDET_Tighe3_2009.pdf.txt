ABSTRACT
The Materials Exposure and Degradation Experiment (TVTEDET) was recently launched to the ISS on
Space Shuttle Flight 1E, as part of the EuTEF payload on the external payload facility of ESA’s
Columbus module. The experiment Will operate in-orbit for at least 1.5 years, and has the overall
objectives of evaluating the effects of the complex low Earth orbit space environment on material
properties, investigating material degradation due to contamination, characterising the local ISS
environment and measuring the local mioro-partiole ﬂux. This paper gives a brief overview of the
experiment function and the material samples Which are being exposed, before presenting some of the
early ﬂight data. In this phase of the mission, all of the instruments are operating successfully, and
continuously acquiring data. The preliminary results mainly concern the environmental sensors, Which are
operating at relatively high acquisition rates (e.g. one reading every few seconds). It has been shown that
the docking of the Space Shuttle to the ISS has a significant effect on the local pressure environment. The
more complex degradation experiments are acquiring at much slower rates (e.g. one reading per day) and
several more months of space exposure Will be required before sufficient data is generated to reach
conclusions about the behaviour of the materials. However, preliminary data is presented.
The three main MEDET scientific obj ectives are :
