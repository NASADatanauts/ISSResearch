11 INTRODUCTION 1
1' This paper is the second part of the work concerned with the problem of outer ?
1g contamination of the International Space Station (188) by incomplete combustion 1
' products (ICP) of fuel components during operation‘of orientation thrusters (OT). 1 1
,1: The problems of ex’perimental modelling of real OT jets were considered in the ﬁrst 1 1
1 . part of this work [1]. The processes of liquid phase transfer to the outlet edge of the 1
1f ' nozzle and in a jet behind it were analyzed there. Demands to the gas-dynamic pro- f ,1
tectors (GDP) limiting the scattering angle of ICP from the orientation thrusters 0f 1‘ '1
1:. spacecraft with short and long service lives were formulated. 1 _;
1 Due to experimental and theoretical investigations presented in [1], recom- i
1 1 mendations and proposals on the scheme and main geometrical sizes of GDP 1
mounted on the OT of the Service-I‘Module (SM) were developed. Using these rec-
1 0mmendations, at Korolev Rocket and Space Corporation “Energia”, the GDPS
1 2: with special design were developed. In‘Ja'nuary 2002, these GDPs were installed in l
1 ” all blocks of OT at the‘Service Module of 188 by astronauts Yu. Onufrienko and 1
1 D. Bursch during their spacewalk. ””- 1
Since the middle of: 2001, the works in the framework of space experiment 1 1
“Kromka 1” were started at the 188. One of the main goals is studying efﬁciency of ' 1'
GDP operation installed at the SM OT under real conditions. By now, two expert} 1
'1 mental stages have been implemented. During the ﬁrst one, characteristics of ICP 1‘ 1
‘-1 ejection, accumulated at the control elements of the “Kromka 1-0” pad during 1
1 about 3,months near the block oﬁ SM OT without GDP, were studied. During the 1
] second experimental stage, GDP was installed‘ at the SM near OT, and the 1 1
1 “Kromka 1-1” pad was exposed during about 7 months. 1 {i

"2","The current paper presents the conditions of the “Kromka 1” experiment,
comparative results on ICP deposition on the control pad elements, composition of
ICP deposit, and analysis of their effect on optic characteristics of thermostatic
coatings. Data on spatial distribution of ICP ejection and its comparison with re-
sults of model experiments are shown.

1. EQUIPMENT, METHODS, AND CONDITIONS OF “KROMKA 1”
SPACE EXPERIMENT

The one-type pads installed near orientation thrusters of SM during spacewalk
were used for this experiment. These pads consisted of a cassette in the form of an
open box with the sizes of 235x 140x20 mm. On the outer side of cassette bottom,
there are handle-staple and special locks for pad ﬁxing on the outer hand-rails near
the OT.

Two types of the control plates were used as the registration elements: alumi-
num alloy plates with silicate thermostatic coating of the “Solar reflectors” class of
the TR-SO-12 grade and “accumulators of fresh contaminants” (AFC) of the 20-
mm diameter and l or 3-mm thickness made of porous hydrocarbon on the basis of
SiC (AFCl) of TiC (AFC2) [2]. Before installation into the cassette, AFCs were
weighted by the analytical balance with the accuracy of 0.001 g. The weight of AFC
was about 0.240 or 0.620 g depending on the disc thickness.

The control plate was installed into the cassette. There were samples of differ-
ent materials and coatings with typical sizes of 30—40 mm on this plate. AFC discs
were mounted in the special pockets of the “Kromka 1-0” under the control plate.
Five calibrated holes of the 8-mm diameter were made in the control plate at the
points, where AFC were mounted (the holes were located within the lower half of
the plate along its longitudinal axis and in its upper right part, Fig. 1).

When being exposed, the AFC materials absorbed the ﬂow of fresh ICP, passed
through the holes in the plate (the initial state of deposit Min). On the control plate sur-
face and on the samples, fresh ICP deposits evaporated due to space ﬂight factors,
leaving a dry deposit (the ﬁnal state of deposit Mﬁn).

After landing, the weight parameter of ICP deposits on the control plate,
samples and AFC were determined under the laboratory conditions together
with chemical compositions of ICP and changes in chemical properties of coat-
in g samples.

The pad “Kromka 1-0” was mounted on October 15, 2001 on the propulsion

module of the 188 SM on a hand-rail near OT+Y

"6","2. SPATIAL DISTRIBUTIONS OF INCOMPLETE COMBUSTION PRODUCTS

The pictures of control plates of pads “Kromka 1-0” and “Kromka 1-1” made
after disassembling of material samples are shown in Fig. 6. The initial state of plate
surfaces is seen in the places of plate location. Comparison of pictures in Fig. 6
qualitatively proves the effect of GDP on ICP distribution in the jet periphery.
Qualitative information on spatial distributions of ICP was obtained via computer
treatment of scanned images of the plates. Corresponding results in the form of de-
pendencies between coloring intensities J and coordinates are shown in Fig. 7 for
plates “Kromka 1-0” and “Kromka 1-1”.

For clearness, data for “Kromka 1-0” and “Kromka 1-1” in cross section Z =
= 66 mm are compared in Fig. 8. Results obtained along Z = 92 mm line passing
over the clear areas of the plate (in experiment covered by samples of materials) are
presented in the same ﬁgure. This data demonstrates the level of zero (background)
intensity of coloring for the given measurements (J0 = 0.023 - 0.027 conventional
units).

These results allow an estimate of operation efﬁciency of protectors installed
on SM OT and comparison of corresponding data obtained by the ﬁeld and model
investigations [1].

Due to analysis of data presented we can make a general conclusion that re-
sults of the ﬁeld and model experiments correlate fairly well. For instance, it is clear
that at operation of OT without GDP (experiment “Kromka 1-0”) numerous
traces of ICP drops are observed (see Fig. 6, a), at treatment these traces provide
local “peaks” (see Figs. 7, a and 8). At operation of OT with GDP (experiment
“Kromka 1-1”), there were no drop traces on the control plate surface (see

. Fig. 6, b), and this explains smoother intensity proﬁles and absence of local “peaks”
(see Figs. 7, b and 8). “Dispersed” properties of screens (GDP) were also observed
in model experiments (e.g., see Fig. 1 l in [1]).

Another important conclusion from data obtained is the presence of maximum
in spatial distribution of ICP at operation of OT without GDP. This maximum was
brighter in model experiments (e.g., see Fig. 8 in [1]), and it was lesser in the ﬁeld
experiments (see zone Y = 70 mm in Fig. 8). This maximum indicates the direction

1 =1 Monotonous drop character of the function obtained in experiment with GDP
2 11 and absence of droplet traces on the surface of control plate of “Kromka 1-1” pad
'13 1 1 allow unequivocal statement that the used construction of GDP completely removes
i 1 E1 the droplet phase of ICP in the range of 6 > 50°. ICP deposit deter’minea in this area
' 1 has a cluster form and comes there together with the gas phase, It is almost impos-
f 1 1 sible to ﬁght with this form of ICP using the outer devices like GDP. The size of
' 1 these devices should be too large. Negative perturbations in jets and weakening of
_-11 the OT thrtist parameters caused by inner gas-dynamics of GDP, may arise as a
111 consequence. A decrease in ejection of the cluster ICP phase should be obtained due
’11 to improvement of OT parameters.
11 We should note that the value of 6 ""=‘ 50° differs only by 10 — 15 % from corre-
sponding values of 6 obtained in

I I In the framework of spaCe experiment “Kromka 1-0”, surface chemistry and ’5

“ spectrometer JMS-D300 and chromatograph HP-5890 and electron-microscopic I ‘I
I analysis by JSM-U3 device of J apanese company “J EOL” [4]. I I
Washouts from different regions of the control plate were studied using the CMS I i
‘3‘ method. According to the detailed study of mass—spectra, corresponding to every I '
chromatograph peak, there are several main products in the mixture obtained after I
I transformation of asymmetrical dimethylhydrazine (ADMH), which is one of fuel
211- components. It was determined at identiﬁcation of these compounds that these are
I. nitrogen-bearing substances, which are the products of ADMH transformation in i I
; ’ oxidizing medium, namely: nitrosodimethylamin, dimethylaminoacenitrile, N,N- di- ‘
3 methylformamide, guanidine, 1-methyl-lH-1,2,4—triazole, lH-l,2,4-dimethyltriazole. ; I
:15 Electron-microscopic research of pad samples proved the presence of nitrogen- I I
I bearing compounds on the surface. IR-spectroscopy of samples in the same regions
I conﬁrmed data obtained by CMS methods. Thus, due to complex investigation of 1;
I the deposit chemical composition on the pad surface, the presence of ICP and trans-
}; formation of rocket fuel components of a complex chemical composition were de- .
I termined.
I Samples (washouts) were taken in four zones of the plate surface (see Fig. 1): I
I 1 —right upper edge, Z—right lower edge, 3 —Ieft lower edge, and 4 — center. ’ICP I

AFC was mounted in a “dead” space of the cassette. The control AFC is completely ’
isolated from the ambient medium (wrapped in aluminum foil). According to CMS . I
I analysis, the above products of ADMH transformation and “extraneous” sub- I
15 stances were determined in standard AFC. “Extraneous” substances are as follows: I I
if ethyl and butyl ethers of acetic, butyl, butane, propane and formic acids, xylene,
alphapinen, butyl acetate, and silicon-organic compounds. The origin of I
“extraneous” substances is connected with biotope in dwelling units of the 188, I

.1 4. OPTIC CHARACTERISTICS OF INCOMPLETE COMBUSTION PRODUCTS
13 Optic characteristics of coatings on the control plates (spectral and integral ab-
? sorption of solar radiation 0: and emissivity factor 8) were studied using some de-
vices (spectroreflectometer LPSR and portable device for measurement of radiant
3 emittance TEMP 2000 produced by AZ Technology company (USA), and superim-
‘ posed photometer FM-59 and thermoradiometer TRM ZOMZ (RF)). Results ob-
tained were compared with coefﬁcients measured before plate installation into cas-
settes. Initial values of optic coefﬁcients of coatings TRSO-12 on control plates
‘ were do = 0.185 1: 0.005, 80 2 0.90. After mounting near OT, value of aincreased.

connect the levels of plate contamination with values of 5a alteration at points of the 1
