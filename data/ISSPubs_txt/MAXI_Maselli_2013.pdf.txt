"3","Long-duration Gamma-Ray Bursts (GRBs) are an extremely rare outcome of

the collapse of massive stars, and are typically found in the distant Universe.

Because of its intrinsic luminosity (L N 3 x 1053 erg s_l) and its relative prox-

imity (z : 0.34), GRB 130427A was a unique event that reached the highest

ﬂuence observed in the y-ray band. Here we present a comprehensive multi-

wavelength View of GRB 130427A with Swift, the 2-m Liverpool and Faulkes

telescopes and by other ground-based facilities, highlighting the evolution of

the burst emission from the prompt to the afterglow phase. The properties of

GRB 130427A are similar to those of the most luminous, high-redshift GRBS,

suggesting that a common central engine is responsible for producing GRBs in

both the contemporary and the early Universe and over the full range of GRB

isotropic energies.
GRB 130427A was the brightest burst detected by Swift (1) as well as by several y—ray detec-
tors onboard other space missions. It was also the brightest and longest burst detected above
100 MeV, with the most energetic photon detected at 95 GeV (2). It was detected by Fermi-
GBM (3) at T0,GBM = 07:47:06.42 UT on April 27 2013. Hereafter this time will be our refer-
ence time T0. The Burst Alert Telescope (BAT, (4)) onboard Swift triggered on GRB 130427A
at t = 51.1 s, when Swift completed a pre-planned slew. The Swift slew to the source started at
t = 148 s and ended at t = 192 s. The Swift UltraViolet Optical Telescope (UVOT, (5)) began
observations at t = 181 s while observations by the Swift X—ray Telescope (XRT, (6)) started
at t = 195 s (see (D for more details). The structure of the y-ray light curve revealed by the
Swift—BAT in the 15—350 keV band (Fig. 1) can be divided in three main episodes: an initial
peak, beginning at t = 0.1 s and peaking at t = 0.5 s; a second large peak showing a complex

3

"
"4","structure with a duration of N 20 s and a third, much weaker episode, starting at t N120 s show-
ing a fast rise/eXponential decay behavior. The overall duration of the prompt emission was T90
(15—150 keV) = 276 i 5 s (i.e. the time containing 90% of the ﬂuence) calculated over the
ﬁrst 1830 s of BAT observation from T0,GBM- During the early phases of the y-ray emission
strong spectral variability is observed (Fig. 1). A marked spectral hardening is observed during
the prompt main event. With a total ﬂuence F : (4.985 i 0.002) x 10—4 erg cm—2 in the 15—
150 keV band, GRB 130427A reached the highest ﬂuence observed for a GRB by Swift. The
0.02—10 MeV ﬂuence measured by Konus-Wind (8) for the main emission episode (0 — 18.7 s)
is (2.68 i 0.01) x 10—3 erg cm‘2, with a spectrum peaking at Epeak : 1028 i 8 keV, while
the ﬂuence of the emission episode at (120 — 250 s) is N 9 X 10—5 erg cm‘2, with a spectrum
peaking at N240 keV (9).

This event was extremely bright also in the optical and it was immediately detected by
various robotic telescopes: in particular, the Raptor robotic telescope detected a bright optical
counterpart already at t = 0.5 s (10). Optical spectroscopy of the afterglow determined the
redshift to be .2 = 0.34 (11); an UVOT UV grism spectrum (D was also acquired. At this
distance the rest frame 1 keV—10 MeV isotropic energy is E130 : 8.1 x 1053 erg and the peak
luminosity is L130 : 2.7 X 1053 erg s_l. According to the luminosity function of Salvaterra et
al. (12) we expect one event like GRB 130427A every > 60 years. In the nearby Universe (i.e.
z s, 0.4, corresponding to an age of N 10 Gyr) only a handful of long GRBs have been detected.
These GRBs are usually characterized by a low overall isotropic energy (E130 g 1052 erg) and
are associated with supernovae (SNe) Ib/c, characterized by broad spectral lines indicating high
expansion velocities, called hypernovae (13). GRB 130427A is instead a powerful GRB such as
the ones typically detected at much higher redshifts (z > 1, with a mean .2 N 2 corresponding
to an age of N 3 Gyr). The detection of a nearby and extremely powerful GRB gives us the
opportunity to test, on the one hand, if this GRB has the same properties of the cosmological

4

"
"5","GRBs and, on the other hand, if also such bright GRBs are associated with SNe. Up to now,
SNe have been associated only to under (or mildly) energetic GRBs in the local Universe. Since
a supernova associated with this burst, SN 2013cq, has been detected (14), we are now sure that
SNe are also associated with very powerful GRBs, not only to low power bursts (see Fig. S6;
see also Fig. 1 of (14)). Naive energetic arguments might suggest that in powerful GRBs there
is not enough power left for a strong SN: GRB 130427A deﬁnitively proves that this is not the
case.

The overall behavior of the X—ray afterglow light curve has been characterized with the
main contribution of the XRT onboard Swift and two additional relevant detections from the
MAXI experiment (15) in the gap between the ﬁrst and the second Swift—XRT observations
(Fig. 2). The early light curve, starting from t = 260 s, is characterized by an initially steep de-
cay with a slope 040,X = 3.32 i 0.17 consistent with high-latitude emission (16, ID, a break
at tLX = 424 i 8 s followed by a ﬂatter decay with indeX 041,x = 1.28 i 0.01. A further
break at t2,X = 48 i 22 ks is statistically needed (3.80) to account for a further steepening
to 042,X = 1.35 i 0.02 (all errors are derived for AX2 : 2.7).

Figure 2 also shows the light curves in the optical and UV derived from the UVOT as well as
from ground-based telescopes (Liverpool telescope, Faulkes Telescope North, and MITSuME
Telescopes). All optical light curves are well ﬁtted by a broken power law with 041 = 0.96 i 0.01,
tbreak = 37.4 fig ks and 042 = 1.36 1:88;. Fitting the X—ray light curve together with the optical
ones, we ﬁnd the same parameters from 26.6 ks onward, but to ﬁt the early part of the X—
ray light curve we need another power—law segment with a slope of 1.29 18:83 and a break at
26.615613 ks (Fig. 2). Therefore, from 26.6 ks onward a common description of all the optical,
UV and X—ray behavior is possible, while at earlier times an extra X—ray component is required.

We interpret the early X—ray light curve (up to 26.6 ks) as the superposition of a standard
afterglow (i.e. forward shock emission) and either the prolonged activity of the central engine

5

"
"6","or/and the contribution from the reverse shock emission (e.g. (18—20)). After 26.6 ks the optical
and X—ray light curves share the same behavior and decay slopes (Fig. 2), including a break
at tbreak N 37 ks. This achromatic break is suggestive of a jet break, although the post-break
decay (042 : 1.36) is shallower than predicted in the simplest theory (an increase in decay slope
> 1 would be expected; see (21)). This could be due to additional components contributing to
the ﬂux, to a time dependence of the microphysical parameters governing the fraction of shock
energy going to electrons (68) and magnetic ﬁeld (613), or to the fact that we observe a canonical
jet not exactly on ads, but still within the jet opening angle (22, 23).

Because the optical and the X—ray emission belong to the same spectral power—law seg-
ment it is possible to constrain the characteristic frequencies of the afterglow spectra, in turn
constraining the microphysical parameters of the relativistic shock. Additional information
comes from the high-energy y-ray emission (2). The y—ray ﬂuX above 100 MeV peaks at
N 20 s. If this emission is due to afterglow radiation, the peak time implies a bulk Lorentz
factor TO N 500 (2, D. Furthermore, the presence of the GeV peak suggests a homogeneous
circumburst density proﬁle (24). Guided by these constraints in our choice of parameters, we
used the BOXF I T code developed by van Eerten et a1. (25) to model the afterglow. Rather than
trying to perform a formal ﬁt to the data we check if this burst, with an unprecedented data COV-
erage and richness, can be interpreted in the framework of the standard model for the afterglow
emission, or else if it forces us to abandon the standard framework. We give more weight to the
optical and higher energy ﬂuxes, since they carry most of the afterglow luminosity, orders of
magnitude greater than the radio ﬂuX.

Neither reverse shock nor inverse Compton (IC) emission are included in the model, but this
does not affect our conclusions which primarily concern the late time synchrotron afterglow
(see (D for further details). The synchrotron ﬂuX predicted by the model reproduces the optical
emission and the X—ray light curve after N 10 ks reasonably well, while the early X—ray ﬂux is

6

"
"7","likely due to an additional component (Fig. 3). Our model underestimates the GeV emission but
this, given the large 66/613 ratio, can be due to synchrotron Self—Compton emission, as envisaged
by (2, 26, 2%. The model can also roughly reproduce the radio emission (further details in (D).

Consistent with the light curve analysis, the synchrotron ﬂuX predicted by the model repro-
duces reasonably well the optical and X—ray parts of the spectral energy distribution (SED) 0f
the afterglow (Fig. 4), but it underestimates the GeV emission. Although the model does not
entirely reproduce the complexity shown by the data, it does capture the main features of the
emission properties in the pure afterglow phase.

Overall, the properties of GRB 130427A are similar to those of the powerful GRBs typically
seen at z N l — 2 (see (D for a comparison). This is the most powerful GRB at z < 0.9. It obeys
the spectral energy correlations such as the Epeak — E130 (28) correlation and the Epeak — Lpeak
(29) correlation. Interpreting the break Observed at N 37 ks as a jet break makes GRB 130427A
consistent with the collimation corrected—peak energy correlation (7, 30). GRB 130427A is
also associated with a supernova, extending the GRB-SN connection also to such powerful and
high—z bursts. GRB 130427A stands as a unique example indicating that a common engine
is powering these huge explosions at all powers, and from the nearby to the very far, early
Universe.

Figure 2: Light curves for GRB 130427A in different wavebands. Swift UV and Visible ﬁlters (1112, m2, wl, u, b,
U); B , V, r’, and 73’ ﬁlters correspond to Faulkes Telescope North; r’ , and 73’ t0 the Liverpool Telescope; g’, r’ , and
73’ t0 the MITSuME telescopes (see 7 for further details). The scaling factors for the ﬂux density in different ﬁlters
is shown in the inset; the scaling factor for the X—ray light curve (ﬂux integrated in the 0.3—10 keV, see 3 is also
shown. The X—ray light curve also includes two MAXI data points at t = 3257 s and t = 8821 s (empty squares).
The ﬁt performed over all the light curves required 24 free parameters (curve normalizations, host galaxy optical
ﬂux in each band, three temporal slopes and two breaks). Because of short—term low—level variability superposed
t0 the long—term behavior and possibly residual inhomogeneity of optical data taken from different telescopes, we
added in quadrature a 9% systematic error in the optical and 5% in the X—rays. Final ﬁt yielded X2 = 543.02 / 565
d.0.f. A contribution from the host galaxy has been taken into account in the optical bands by ﬁtting a constant
ﬂux of N 0.01 rnJy for the reddest bands, corresponding to rHG = 21.26 mag as tabulated in the SDSS catalogue.
As a test of consistency, we performed the ﬁt using a broken power law for the B , g’ , r’ and 73’ ﬁlters individually.
Uncertainties are larger, but we do ﬁnd that the values of tbreak as well as the decay indices before and after the
break time are still consistent, within the errors, with the values obtained by the overall ﬁt.

"18","1 Observations and Data Analysis

1.1 Swift Discovery and Observations

1.1.1 BAT Observations

BAT triggered 0n GRB 130427A (I) at 2013-04-27 07:47:57.5 UTC (trigger # 554620) 51.1
seconds later than the Fermi-GBM trigger (32), after Swift completed a pre-planned slew. Here-
after, all times are referred to T0,GBM so that t = T—TQGBM. The BAT trigger was on the tail of
the main peak, in a 64-second image trigger (see (4) for details on the BAT triggering system).
The Swift slew t0 the source started at t = 148 s and ended at t = 192 s. The BAT position
of the burst, initially calculated onboard and then reﬁned in ground analysis, is RAJ2000 2 11h
32m 365.1, DeCJQOOO = +270 42’ 20” .3 with an uncertainty of 1’ .0 (radius, sys+stat, 90% con-
tainment); this is 49’ ’ .9 from the radio afterglow position RAJ2000 2 11h 32m 325.82, DecJ2000
= +270 41’ 56’ ’ .06 determined with a precision of 0’ ’ .4 (33).

The BAT mask—weighted light curve in the 15—350 keV band is shown in Figure S 1. A ﬁrst
pulse beginning at t = 0.13 s and peaking at t = 0.5 s is followed by another, smaller pulse at
t = 1.1 s. Then the main episode of emission begins gradually at t = 2.2 s, with a sharp pulse
at t = 5.4 s. A multi-peaked intense emission follows, lasting a total of about 5 seconds with a
peak at t N 8 s. A few, less intense pulses follow on top of a decay from the main episode, with
rise and decay 011 a time scale of a few seconds, the last peaking at about t = 26 s. There was
some signiﬁcant deadtime over the main peak of the event, that was corrected with a maximum
correction factor of 1.72. At t = 120 s we have a fast rise with two overlapping pulses peaking
at t = 131 s and t = 141 s, respectively, followed by an exponential decay. After t = 270 s there
are no further prominent features. The decaying emission in the BAT energy range, well ﬁt by
a power-law model, was detectable until the end of the Observation at t = 2021 s. BAT data
corresponding to the last 1031 s were collected in survey mode.

"19","1.1.2 XRT Observations

XRT data were accumulated in Windowed Timing (WT) and Photon Counting (PC) mode (6)
depending on the brightness of the source. The pointed Swift—XRT Observations of GRB 130427A
started at t = 195 s in WT mode. Due to the loss of star tracker lock that occurred soon after
the beginning of the observation, the attitude ﬁle needed for data reduction has been manu-
ally reconstructed using the UVOT data (see section 1.1.3) to provide time-dependent pointing
corrections for the XRT data. For the subsequent Observations the loss of star tracker lock oc-
curred again for several further short time intervals: data affected by bad attitude reconstruction
were adequately screened during the data reduction process. Swift—XRT Observations that were
used for this work include a total net exposure time Of rvl826 s in WT mode and N 203 ks in
PC mode up to the sequence O90, spread over a N 4 Ms baseline. The XRT data set was ﬁrst pro-
cessed with the XRTDAS software package (V.2.8.O) developed at the ASI Science Data Center
(ASDC) and distributed by HEASARC within the HEASOft package (V. 6.13). Event ﬁles were
calibrated and cleaned with standard ﬁltering criteria with the XRTPIPELINE task using the lat-
est calibration ﬁles available in the Swift CALDB. Standard grade ﬁltering was applied: 0—12
for PC data and 0—2 for WT data. The list Of all XRT Observations of GRB 130427A used for
the present analysis is shown in Table 81.

The ﬁrst XRT Observation in WT mode partially overlaps the time interval during which
BAT data are available, from its start until t = 990 s; the remaining part is given by 1031 s of
data. The count rate of the ﬁrst XRT Observation was high enough to cause severe pile-up in the
WT mode data. To account for this effect, the WT data were extracted in annular regions with
a 60-pixel (1 pixel = 2.36”) external radius and a variable radius of the inner excluded region
depending on the pile-up degree. The size of the exclusion region was determined following the
procedure illustrated in (34). The values adopted for the inner radius are reported in Table 82.

Data from light curves and spectra relevant to Observations in PC mode were extracted

l9

"
"20","using the task XRTGRBLC, that performs the appropriate corrections for Vignetting and PSF
losses. The task Optimizes the extraction regions according to the count rate of the source in
each orbit, excluding a central circular region in case Of pile-up (sequences 001 to 013) whose
radius is reported in Table 82. The background was extracted from an annular region with inner
and outer radii 47 and 90 pixels, respectively. Ancillary response ﬁles were generated with the
XRTMKARF task allowing us to correct for CCD defects. We used the latest CALDB response
matrices (rmf): V013 (PC mode) and V014 (WT mode).
1.1.3 UVOT Observations
Swift Ultraviolet Optical Telescope (UVOT; (5,35,3®) began Observing the burst at t = 181 s.
During the automatic sequence, Swift was unable to obtain a positional lock using the onboard
catalogue as there were too few guide stars in the ﬁeld of View. The loss of star tracker lock
caused the optical afterglow to wander across the image plane, so that with each consecutive
exposure the afterglow position shifted increasingly in RA and Dec away from the reported
position. For longer exposures this movement caused the point sources in the image to be
trailed. Since these Observations were taken in event mode (where the position and timing of
each event are recorded down to a time resolution of 11 ms), we were able to aspect correct the
observations to a ﬁner time resolution than the duration of each exposure and recover the trailed
sources as point sources. Because the Observed and actual positions of the stars in the image
were different by up to N 300”, the aspect correction was performed in a two—step process.
First, a coarse aspect correction was determined manually for each exposure; then, a ﬁne aspect
correction was determined by extracting an image from the event list every 10 s and cross-
correlating the stars in the image with those in the USNO-Bl catalogue. The differences in RA
and Dec were then applied to each event falling within the particular 10 s interval (SD.

During the ﬁrst 2 ks of Observations, the optical afterglow 0f GRB 130427A was so bright

20

"
"21","that UVOT suffered from heavy coincidence losses and scattered light. The v-band 10 s settling
point Observed from t = 181 s, the majority of white data before T+2000 s, and the b and u band
data Observed before 650 s could not be recovered. However, using the read-out streaks (38) we
were able to obtain photometry for the white band data between 506 and 1023 s and for the ﬁrst
I) and u band exposures. Earlier and later saturated white data are beyond the recommended
range for the read-out streak method. We were also able to obtain photometry from UVOT UV
grism spectrum, which provides the earliest UVOT photometry for this GRB, by folding the
spectrum through the ﬁlter response curves.

For the later follow-up Observations, the star tracker obtained a positional lock on most
images, but for the Observations where it failed to lock the images are trailed or the point sources
are blurred. Therefore, we manually inspected all exposures and excluded those that would
produce unreliable photometry. For the aspect corrected event mode data, the photometry was
obtained using the uV0t tool UVOTEVTLC, while the image mode data were processed using the
uvot tool UVOTMAGHIST. The photometry for the image and event mode Observations were
extracted using a circular aperture with a radius of 5’ ’ when the count rate was above 0.5 cts s_l,
and 3’ ’ aperture when the count rate had dropped below 0.5 cts s_l; an appropriate background
region was used. We applied coincidence loss corrections and standard photometric calibrations
(39-41). The analysis pipeline used software HEASOFT 6.13 and UVOT calibration 20130118.
The list Of UVOT Observations which were included in the analysis Of GRB 130427A are shown
in Table S3.

Since November 2008 the automated sequence that is triggered by a strong burst includes
a 50-sec0nd UV grism exposure after the ﬁrst white ﬁnder chart. A magnitude brighter than
’0 = 12 mag is needed to get a GRB detection. GRB 130427A provided the second good early
UV spectrum from the instrument.

The data reduction required special adaptations due to the loss of star tracker lock which

21

"
"22","affected the normal processing. Using the data of detected photon positions in the white ﬁlter
prior to the grism exposure in image mode, and assuming a steady motion, the spacecraft moved
during the grism exposure by about 9.5” (18 pixels) under an angle of 640 to the dispersion in
the direction of longer wavelengths. Assuming a smooth motion, this translates into a shift of
m 54 A in the dispersion direction.

The blurring effect of the motion on the grism image was determined by deconvolVing a
zeroth order of a fainter object in the grism image by a zeroth order from an image obtained
during normal Swift operations, i.e., with attitude lock. The resulting kernel shows the exposure
locations on the detector for that zeroth order and thus suggests that the exposure was mainly
taken whilst the pointing rested in two locations about 7 pixels apart under an angle consistent
with the analysis from the white ﬁlter event data. Using that kernel to deconvolve the grism
image, a cleaner grism image was obtained where the effects of blurring are to a large extent
removed. For the deconvolution the STARLINK LUCY program was used.

To determine the position of the spectrum on the detector, the last 5 seconds of the event
data from the white ﬁlter ﬁnder were separately processed and aspect—corrected using the HEA-
SOFT 6.13 tools. This image ended 5.5 s before the start of the grism exposure, so the position
of the source on the detector in the white ﬁlter was known. Using the new grism calibration
and related software this was used to determine
the location of the spectrum on the grism image and extract the spectrum with good knowledge
of the wavelength scale.

The ﬂux calibration used includes a correction for coincidence loss which is estimated to
be in the range of 10-20% for this spectrum. There is partial overlap of second order emission,
estimated to start affecting the ﬂux above the observed wavelength of 3000 A by 15%, slowly
varying thereafter. The spectrum observed above 3000 A can be used to some extent for the
spectral lines present, for example, redshifted Mg II 2800 A resonance line is present as one of

22

"
"23","the strongest absorptions.

The Swift UVOT spectrum with wavelengths converted to the rest frame of the GRB host is
shown in Figure S2. The wavelength scale in the UVOT grisms is not calibrated on board and its
accuracy relies on the knowledge of the position of the source. A Mg II 2800 A resonance line
seems present with a signiﬁcance larger than 4 0, although not exactly at the right frequency
location. The width of this line is larger (by a factor of two) than expected from the estimated
satellite motion from the deconvolution kernel, which would be of order of 15 A only if not
already removed by the image deconvolution.

1.2 MAXI Observations

The Gas Slit Camera (GSC; (42)) 0f Monitor 0f All-sky X—ray Image (MAXI; (15)) detected
GRB 130427A with one Of its cameras (camera #4) at the two consecutive scan transits centered
at t = 3257 s and t = 8821 s. The effective area of the GSC camera during the transit had a
triangular shape with the FWZM duration of 52 seconds and the peak effective area of 3.9 cm2
at these Observations. In the present analysis, we assumed the ﬂuX within a transit to be constant.
This assumption is justiﬁed considering that the time interval since the trigger (N thousands of
seconds) is much longer than the transit time (N 50 s), and therefore the variation within the
transit is negligible. MAXI usually scans a speciﬁc position in the sky once every International
Space Station orbit (% 92 min period). No signiﬁcant ﬂuX was detected in the GSC Cameras
from the source at the last scan transit of the GRB location before the trigger (t : —2308 s) and
at the third scan after the trigger (t : +14385 s). The calibration of the energy response and
details of its ﬂight performance is described in (43).

23

"
"24","1.3 BAT and XRT Spectral Analysis

We extracted several 15—150 keV BAT spectra at different time intervals starting from t = —0.1 s
up to the end of the BAT observation. We ﬁtted all these spectra with a simple power-law model
and the best-ﬁt parameters are reported in Table S4. A signiﬁcant spectral evolution is apparent
in the spectral results: the variation of the power-law photon index is shown in the bottom panel
of Figure 83.

In the time interval between t = 195 s and t = 990 s, corresponding to the overlap between
the BAT data and the XRT—WT data, we carried out a simultaneous broad band (0.3—150 keV)
spectral analysis, building the BAT and XRT spectra in nine common time intervals (see Ta-
ble S4). After the end of the BAT observation, the spectral analysis is based only on the 03—10
keV XRT data. Both the WT spectra collected between t = 990 s and t = 2021 s and the PC
spectra collected after t = 2.2 x 104 s can be well described by an absorbed power law with a
column density ﬁxed to the line-of-sight value of 1.8 X 10200111—2 plus an intrinsic (redshifted)
and time varying (in the ﬁrst 1 ks) absorption (see Table S4).

We are aware that ﬁtting a slightly curved spectra with a power law introduces small biases
in the column density estimate (e.g. (44)). Therefore, we do not consider the column density
increase derived from power-law ﬁtting of the afterglow data to be physically signiﬁcant.

We have veriﬁed that no signiﬁcant spectral variations occur during the XRT—PC monitoring,
with the power-law index consistent with a constant value. Thus we have obtained an average
PC spectrum from Observation sequences 001 to 039: the results of the averaged spectral anal-
ysis are reported in Table S4.

1.4 FluX-calibrated X—ray Light Curve

We used the data from Swift—BAT, Swift—XRT and MAXI/GSC to build a ﬁuX-calibrated X—ray

light curve in the 03—10 keV band. We used the results of the BAT spectral analysis in the
24

"
"25","15—150 keV band to compute the conversion factor needed to obtain the 0.3— 10 keV ﬂuX from
the count rate of the 64 ms BAT mask—weighted light curve up to t : 202 s. This conversion
factor was computed with higher precision in the time interval in which the BAT and XRT data
overlap using the results of the simultaneous BAT and XRT spectral analysis. The 03—10 keV
ﬂuX for the MAXI/GSC data was obtained assuming the power-law model with a photon indeX
PM = 1.8 i 0.1 derived from the spectral analysis carried out on XRT data at close epochs.

The 03—10 keV ﬂuX-calibrated light curve that we obtained is shown in Figure S3. The
good agreement between the BAT and the XRT light curves when they overlap can be inter-
preted as the sign that the early X—ray light curve (t < 103 s) is probably still related to the
prompt emission. For t > 260 s the X—ray light curve can be ﬁtted with a double-broken
power law. The ﬁrst decay is steep with 040,X : 3.32 i 0.17 and a break at t1,x : 424 i 8 s.
The decay then ﬂattens t0 041,x : 1.28 i 0.01. A further break is needed, even if not
well constrained. The second break occurs at t27X : 48 i 22 ks and the slope steepens t0
042,X : 1.35 i 0.02. We remark that it is only thanks to the very good quality of our data
that we were able to reveal this further break, whose signiﬁcance is 3.8 0, estimated through
an F-test. The reported errors are derived computing the interval for a AX2 : 2.71 and are
therefore the errors at 90% conﬁdence level for one parameter of interest. A 5% error has been
summed in quadrature to all the points to obtain a good ﬁt with a reduced xfed : 0.9 with 243
degrees of freedom. These decay indices and break times lie well within the distribution of
those parameters as seen for the GRB population as a whole (45,46)I

We plot in Figure S4 all the X—ray light curves of the GRBs Observed by Swift—XRT (627
GRBs as of June 4, 2013). As it can be seen, GRB 130427A has the brightest X—ray afterglow,
in term of Observed ﬂux, that have ever been Observed by XRT. But this is due both to the
intrinsic brightness of this burst and to its proximity that enhance its ﬂuxes. A more informative
—r update versions of these populations

25

"
"26","plot is the comparison of the luminosity of this GRB with those of other bright GRBs. To this
end we plot in Figure SS the rest-frame isotropic luminosity curves for a sub-sample of GRBs
observed by Swift (both X—ray and v-ray luminosity). We do not show the faintest GRBs,
to avoid overcrowding, and include also the brightest Fermi GRBs. As can be seen, even if
GRB 130427A has the brightest X—ray afterglow in term of observed ﬂux, it has a normal
behaVior in term of rest-frame luminosity. In fact, although it lies at the bright end, it is fully
consistent with the range displayed by the long GRBs population at large.

1.5 Ground—based OpticaWIR Observations

The 2—m Faulkes Telescope North (FTN) robotically followed up GRB 130427A starting at
t = 5.1 minutes, corresponding to N 220 s in the rest frame. Observations were carried out
with a scheduled sequence of images with the B, V, 7"", and 7"" ﬁlters (4% for the subsequent
5 hours. From 2.4 hrs after the detection, observations were performed also with the MITSuME
Telescopes (0.5-m Akeno Observatory, 0.5-m Okayama Observatory and 1.05-m Ishigakijima
Observatory; (48)) using the 9’, RC, and [C ﬁlters and following the optical afterglow up to
5.2 days. Data in these ﬁlters were calibrated with respect to the SDSS g’, 7"", and 7"" bands, re-
spectively. Late time observations have been performed also with the 2-m Liverpool Telescope
(LT) in the time interval between 1.5 days and N 19 days after the burst, using the Sloan ﬁlters
SDSS-7"" and SDSS-z"".

Calibration of the entire optical data set was carried out with respect to a common set of
selected ﬁeld stars. Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) catalogued stars were used for the g’,
7"" and 7"" ﬁlters, while standard stars were used for the B and V ﬁlters. A summary of our
calibrated data, with a log of all the observations and magnitudes of the optical counterpart in
all ﬁlters, can be found in Tables 85—89.

26

"
"27","1.6 Consistency With Spectral Energy Correlations
With the exception of very few outliers, the long GRBs obey the spectral energy correlations
between the rest-frame peak energy Epeak Of their spectrum and the overall isotropically equiva-
lent energetics E130 (28) or isotropic peak luminosity L130 (29). It is interesting to verify whether
GRB 130427A follows these correlations as well. Figure S6 shows how GRB 130427A is lo-
cated in both the “Amati” and the “Yonetoku” planes. As can be seen, it lies exactly on the best
ﬁt of both. In the same ﬁgure, the green stars show GRBs associated with a spectroscopically
conﬁrmed supernova (14). Note how GRB 130427A stands out.

If the break at N 37 ks is indeed a jet break, we can calculate the opening angle of the jet
Qj. With a homogeneous circumburst medium of density n : 1 cm‘3 and a kinetic energy of
the ﬁreball equal to E19130 : 4 x 1054 erg, we derive @- N 30. The corresponding collima-
tion corrected energy is E,y : 1051 erg. This makes GRB 130427A consistent (at 20) also
with the correlation between Epeak and the collimation corrected energetics E,y (the so-called
“Ghirlanda” correlation, see (30)).

27

"
"28","2 Result of the SED modeling
In this section we will try to establish if the extraordinary richness and quality of data of GRB
130427A can be explained in the simple and standard framework of a relativistic ﬁreball running
into the circumburst medium (CBM), that decelerates the ﬁreball and produces two shocks: the
forward shock, running into the CBM, and the reverse shock, running into the ejected material of
the ﬁreball. To this aim we adopt a publicly available model, developed by (25), that captures
with some details the main physical processes we believe are occurring. On the other hand,
reality is surely more complex than a simple standard model can account for. There can be
more speciﬁc versions of the standard model, e.g. the ﬁreball could be structured (namely,
having an angular proﬁle of bulk Lorentz factors and energies), the CBM could be clumped,
the microphysical parameters could be varying in time and in space. However, all these are
“versions” of the standard model (a collimated ﬁreball running into the CBM) that we aim to
test in its pillars, and not in its “details”. We therefore ask: does the basic model reasonably
account for the Observed properties of this data—rich burst, or should we drastically reconsider
our current general View Of GRB physics?
2.1 Main assumptions
The similarity of the X—ray and optical light curves after N 104 seconds suggests that they are
produced by the same process. The similarity of their spectral indices indicates that they belong
to the same power-law spectrum. Therefore, we assume that the optical and the X—ray emission,
after N 104 seconds, are both afterglow emission produced by a forward shock. Before 104 s, an
extra component contributes to the emission, most notably in the X—rays. This extra component
could be late prompt emission or reverse shock emission, but we will not model it.

The Fermi—LAT emission, above 100 MeV, is not correlated with the N MeV emission as
shown by the GBM 0r BAT, but shows a peak at N 20 seconds followed by a power-law decay

28

"
"29","(see (2)). These properties suggest that the Fermi-LAT ﬂuX is afterglow emission produced
by a forward shock. The peak of the emission indicates the onset of the afterglow. We also
assume that the LAT luminosity above 100 MeV is a proxy of the bolometric luminosity of the
afterglow. This should be truly independent of the radiation process originating this high-energy
emission.

We assume that the radio emission could either be the low frequency part Of the X—ray and
optical forward shock emission, or instead be due to a reverse shock as suggested by (31). In
the latter case our afterglow model, with no reverse shock emission, should underestimate the
Observed radio emission.

We assume that the achromatic break in the light curves at N 37 ks is a jet break.

2.2 General derived properties

Density proﬁle — In the case Of a homogeneous density, Lbol increases during the coasting
phase (cmonstant) as the Observed surface area, hence as 152. If the circumburst medium has a
wind density proﬁle 71 oc R‘2, the increase of the Observed surface area in the coasting phase is
exactly compensated by the decreasing density, and the bolometric luminosity is constant (see,
e.g., (49) and Eq. 11 in (50)). After the deceleration time, for an adiabatic ﬁreball we have
Lbol oc 15—1 both for the homogeneous and the wind density proﬁle, as long as the emission
occurs in the fast cooling regime. This is independent from the radiation process producing the
LAT ﬂux [e.g. synchrotron 0r synchrotron self—Compton (SSC)].

There eXists the possibility that the GeV peak is produced by a reverse shock, possibly
connected with the early optical ﬂux (10). However, in this case, the decay slope of the optical
ﬂuX depends on the density proﬁle, and if it is wind—like, it is steeper than Observed (51).

The ﬂuX decay after the peak is suggestive of an homogeneous medium if the GeV emission
is SSC, since a wind density proﬁle would make the GeV light curve substantially steeper than

29

"
"30","Observed (this point is made very explicitly by (26)). If the GeV is synchrotron, instead, we
face the problem of explaining the nature of the very energetic photons (up to 130 GeV, rest
frame) that are not expected in a shock acceleration scenario (see discussion in (2)). Another
problem, shown in Fig. 11 0f (52), is the over—prediction 0f the ﬂux at early times (t < 300 s)
in the Swift—BAT and Fermi-LAT energy ranges.

A wind medium has been assumed to reproduce the X—ray/Optical/radio data of GRB 130427A
(31,52) and to explain the early optical ﬂux (10). In (31), the wind like density is preferred by
comparing the predicted and Observed X—ray decay slope. The slope predicted by the homoge-
neous density is closer to the Observed decay. Nevertheless, they chose the wind density proﬁle
(compare the following values derived by (31): predicted decay in the wind case: 04,, : 1.64,
in the homogeneous case: 04,, : 1.14, Observed value: 04,, : 1.35). Furthermore, their wind
afterglow model requires a kinetic energy E19130 N 1052 erg, which is only 1% 0f the prompt
emission energy (EmSO : 1054 erg), which seems rather low. This small value of E19130 implies
rather large values of the microphysical parameters: 613 and 68 are of order unity. As a conse-
quence, the 66/63 ratio is also of order unity, and this limits the possibility to eXplain the GeV
emission as due to the SSC process. It is then difﬁcult to eXplain the detection of photons up
to 130 GeV (rest frame). The normalization of the wind density proﬁle is roughly 1,000 times
smaller than expected by a typical star wind, even if this parameter is still largely uncertain for
the (unknown) ﬁnal phases of the life of a massive star.

Finally, we have considered a generic stratiﬁed medium, with a density 71 OC T‘s, with s : 1
and s : 1.5, following (53), with the hope to ameliorate the problems of the pure wind—like
scenario. We did ﬁnd that these solutions present a deceleration peak ﬂuX, that can eXplain the
peaked GeV emission, but are worst representations of the data at the other frequencies.

To conclude, i) the presence of the peak of the light curve and ii) the relatively ﬂat decay
slope of the light curves at all frequencies are Observational evidences supporting the homoge-

30

"
"31","neous CBM. Further support of this hypothesis is given by the small kinetic energy (requiring
very large efﬁciencies) and the small wind normalization required by the proposed wind mod-
els. The latter are certainly possible, but the required (not mainstream) assumptions and the
remaining open issues, in our Opinion, are more than in the homogeneous case, that therefore
we choose.

Bulk Lorentz factor — The time Of the onset of the afterglow, for an assumed radiative
efﬁciency 77 (deﬁned through E130 : nEkJSO, where E19130 is the isotropic equivalent kinetic
energy of the ﬁreball) and ISM density 71, allows us to infer the value of the bulk Lorentz factor
F0 0f the ﬁreball before deceleration, i.e. during the coasting phase (see the discussion in (24)
about the existing formulae). For E77130 : 1054 erg s_l, 77 : 0.1, tpk : 20 s and a density n : 1
cm‘3 we obtain F0 : 505 (using the formula in (24)), scaling as F0 oc [E77130 / (nntgk)]1/8.

M icrophysical parameters: 613 — The fraction of the available energy at the relativistic shock
going to relativistic electrons and to magnetic energy is parameterized by 68 and 613, respectively.
The fact that the X—ray and the optical light curves share the same temporal proﬁle in the
104—106 s interval implies that they belong to the same spectral power law branch. Therefore
the characteristic frequencies, such as the injection frequency Vinj or the cooling frequencies
V0001, that are time—dependent, must be located outside the Optical—X—ray frequency range in
this time interval because, otherwise, the light curves could not be parallel. The requirement
V0001 3 10 keV can be fulﬁlled if 613 is small (of the order of 10—5—10_4) implying a modest
cooling (in turn implying a large V0001). This small value Of 613 is not unprecedented, since it
agrees with those found by (54) for the GRBs detected in the GeV band by the LAT on board
Fermi. However, more Often 63 is around N 10—2 — 10—3 (19,53).

Microphysical parameters: 68 — If the LAT emission is afterglow by a forward shock, and
if it is a good proxy for the bolometric luminosity (LLAT : f Lb01), we can derive 66. In the

31

"
"32","fast cooling regime, LLAT after the deceleration time is given by (see e.g. (24))
LLAT = f Lbol = % @§ 75 Z tpk; Ekin,iso = Emiso (1:7) (1)
therefore
68 ~ éﬁﬁtpk (2)
With E77130 ~ 1054 erg, 77 : 0.1, f N 1/6 and LLAT ~ 1.6 x 1051 erg s—1 at tpk ~ 15 s (in the
rest frame), we derive 68 N 10—2. Notice that this is independent 0f the emissian pmcess (see
the discussion after Eq. 1 in (55)).

Jet Opening angle and viewing angle — Deﬁning the Viewing angle 6V as the angle between
the line of sight and the jet aXis, we have that a non—zero 6V produces two breaks in the light
curve, the ﬁrst when 1/F : QJ- — 6V, and the second when 1/F : @~ + 6V. With respect to
an observer located on the jet aXis (6V : 0) the Off—aXis Viewer should see the jet break as
a smoother transition (e.g. (25,5®). This could help make the post—break light curve decay
less steeply than predicted, as in our ease, up to the second break. The latter could be hidden
in the optical by the host galaxy+supern0va contribution to the light curve ﬂux, but should be
Visible in the X—ray light curve. Note that a shallow break can also be the result of time-varying
microphysical parameters: if 613 and 66 increase, then the light curve decays less steeply than
predicted by the simplest theory, at least up to the time when 613 and 68 stop increasing (since
the range of their values is limited). After that time, the light curve should decay as expected
by the simple theory.

Radio spectra — The available radio data (as in (31)) indicate a rather ﬂat spectrum, in-
consistent with self—absorption and roughly consistent with E, oc V1/3, the single electron
synchrotron spectrum. This indicates that in the radio range Va < V < Vinj. A small Va in turn
requires a small density (of the relativistic electrons responsible for the synchrotron emission

32

"
"33","and absorption), much smaller than the typical value of n N l cm‘3. A large Vinj oc VEHJBF
requires large energies of the electrons.

2.3 Modeling

The model — To model the SEDs and the light curves at any frequency of GRB 130427A we
use the model developed by (25). This model considers the synchrotron emission produced by
the forward shock of an adiabatic ﬁreball expanding into a homogeneous medium. The ﬁreball
is canonical (namely, matter, not magnetically dominated, and uniform, i.e. with radial velocity
directions that are not a function of the angle from the jet aXis) with an opening angle QJ, Viewed
at an angle 6V from the aXis. It accounts for the so called “jet—break”, i.e the break in the light
curve occurring when l / F N QJ. Arrival times from the emitting volume are properly calculated.
The model does not include the emission from the reverse shock, nor the contribution from
synchrotron self—Compton (SSC) process. The lack of SSC is a rather serious limitation in
the ﬁrst (fast cooling) phases of the afterglow if the Comptonization parameter y (regulating
the importance of the SSC radiation) is large, while in slow cooling the importance of SSC
radiation rapidly decreases. Although we require a small 613, and y N (Ee/EB)1/2 (see above),
our modeling pertains to the slow cooling phase, therefore the lack of SSC does not affect our
results. Table 810 lists the parameters of the models shown in Figure S7 (light curves) and
Figure 3 0f the main journal article (SEDs).

The LAT light curve — As mentioned above, the time proﬁle of the bolometric light curve
in fast cooling is independent of the emission process. If the LAT ﬂuX is indeed close to the
bolometric ﬂux, then its behavior cannot be used to discriminate between — say — synchrotron
and SSC emission, provided that both processes are capable of generating high-energy photons.
For GRB 130427A photons exceeding 40 GeV have been observed, with one exceeding 90 GeV,
and this represents a problem for the synchrotron interpretation of the high-energy ﬂuX (see, e.g.

33

"
"34","(5 D). On the other hand, both SSC and inverse Compton scattering between the accelerated
electrons and the prompt emission photons still present in the ﬁreball can contribute to the GeV
ﬂux. This is even more likely if 613 is indeed very small. In this case the Comptonization y
parameter is bound to be large in fast cooling, making the Compton process the dominant one
(unless the synchrotron typical frequencies, in the comoving frame, are so large as to make the
Compton process to be in the Klein—Nishina regime).

Ghisellini et al. (55) discussed the case of a radiative ﬁreball to eXplain the time decay of
several GRBs whose y—ray ﬁuX decayed as 15—15 even though their spectral slope was close to
DV : 2. The decay slope of GRB 130427A is instead close to unity, i.e. what is expected from
the bolometric luminosity decay of an adiabatic ﬁreball. This can be explained if we consider
that in GRB 130427A the afterglow onset time is close to 15 seconds: this may appear to be
a very short time, but it is nevertheless later than the onset time of the bursts considered in
(55). This relatively late onset implies that the total energy emitted in the LAT energy band is
signiﬁcantly lower than the prompt emission energy. If the prompt emission did not contain
a sizable fraction of the kinetic energy of the ﬁreball, then Ek N E77130 / 77 and does not vary
during the y—ray emission. In other words, the ﬁreball remains adiabatic or quasi—adiabatic.
We stress that if the ISM had a wind density proﬁle, then the initial light curve of the bolometric
luminosity would be ﬂat, without any peak. Therefore an homogeneous medium is consistent
with interpreting the peak of the LAT light curve as the afterglow onset, while a wind density
proﬁle would require another interpretation for the same peak.

The XRT light curve — The model reproduces the X—ray light curve after N 104 seconds.
We suggest that before this time the X—ray ﬂux is dominated by late prompt emission and
high—latitude radiation. By “late prompt” emission we mean radiation produced by the same
mechanism(s) producing the main GRB event, but occurring later. By “high—latitude” radiation
we mean the radiation from parts of the emitting surface not on aXis with the line of sight. If

34

"
"35","the surface switches off abruptly, the distant observer will see that a ﬂux decaying in time at
a predictable rate, as a result of the different arrival time Of the photons combined with the
different degree of beaming. Indeed, the XRT and BAT light curves are very similar as long as
BAT detects the burst (N19OO seconds).

The optical—U V light curve — In Figure S7 we show how the model reproduces the best
sampled optical light curves, in the R, 7"" and RC ﬁlters. In the other optical bands the behavior
is the same. In the model of the optical emission shown in Figure S7, we have added a constant
contribution corresponding to R : 21.3 (ﬂux density NO.0113 mJy) due to the host galaxy
(dashed line in Figure S7).

Jet break — We interpret the break at N 37 ks as a jet break, corresponding to a jet Open-
ing angle of N 3.40. We assume 6V : 00. In fact, although the assumption of a non—zero
6V could help to explain the shallow decay of the post—break light curve (oc 25—13, shallower
than predicted by the standard model, e.g. (58)), the late X—ray data (not affected by the host
galaxy+supern0va emission) do not show any further steepening 0f the light curve up to t N 45
days. We are then led to assume that the radiation emitted in the post—break phase is larger
than what simple theory predicts (shown by the dotted models in Figure S7). This can be the
result of having energy injection, increasing the total ﬁreball energy which in turn increases
the amount of emitted radiation. Alternatively, we can maintain a constant ﬁreball energy, but
increase the amount of energy given to the electrons Ge. 68). We prefer the latter solution be-
cause it has a lower energy requirement. We then assume that 68 oc (75/15906 after 156 : 0.8 day.
Then, to obtain a reasonable agreement between the optical and X—ray data (circles and crosses
in Figure S7) and the model, we also assume that 613 oc (75/15905 after the same 156 : 0.8 day.
Possible evolution of the microphysical parameters at the shocks have been invoked to explain
the multiwavelength light curves (in the X—ray and optical bands) of some GRBs (e.g. (59)).

35

"
"36","The radio light curve — The model that we have described above, which assumes an evo-
lution of the 66 and 613 parameters, over—predicts the radio ﬂuX (dot—dashed line vs squares in
Figure S7). This is due to the fact that the Vinj frequency is too small and it is even smaller
than the self—absorption frequency Va. The injection frequency is anj oc yfnjBF oc 6: 6113/ 215—3/ 2.
Changing the microphysical parameters inevitably leads to other inconsistencies. An extra de-
gree of freedom is the fraction of the electrons that are accelerated at the shock front and that
produce the radiation received by the observer. Instead of assuming that the shock accelerates
one electron per proton, we can assume that only a fraction k < 1 of the present electrons are
accelerated. In this way we can increase the energy per electron and, therefore, increase Vinj.
This, however, must occur in such a way as to satisfy the requirement that Vinj is smaller than the
observed optical frequencies, at least between 104 and 106 seconds, if the optical ﬂuX remains a
power law of the same slope in this time interval.

Admittedly, the complex behavior of the afterglow of GRB 130427A in the radio, optical,
X—ray and y—ray bands cannot be fully captured by a simple and standard afterglow model, e.g.
synchrotron and self Compton emission by a forward shock, with non-varying microphysical
parameters. Therefore we must ask ourselves: does GRB 130427A require a complete revision
of our ideas about the origin of the afterglow emission? Our answer is no: the unique richness
of the GRB 130427A data can still be explained within the framework of the standard model. It
surely requires extra assumptions, but not a radical change.

Figure S6. The Amati (left panel) and Yonetoku (right panel) correlations. Grey ﬁlled Circles refer to the sample
studied in (60). Their power—law ﬁt is shown as a solid dark line. Green stars correspond to GRBs associated With
a spectroscopically conﬁrmed supernova. The shaded region represents the 30 scatter of the distribution of points
around this best ﬁt line. GRB 130427A (red Circle) lies exactly on the best ﬁt of both correlations.

Figure S7. The optical, X—ray, v—ray and radio light curves are interpreted as forward shock afterglow synchrotron
emission, as derived applying the van Eerten et 211. model. Dotted lines corresponds to the ﬁrst line in Table 810,
namely 68, EB and the fraction k of accelerated electrons are constant. The solid line corresponds to the model
When varying these microphysical parameters. The dot—dashed line shown only for the radio band, corresponds to
the model With only 68 and EB varying in time and With constant k.
