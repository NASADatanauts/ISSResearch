Abstract
This paper compares ﬁndings from two NASA—funded studies of international long—duration missions to the Mir space station
(Shuttle/Mir) and to the International Space Station (188). American and Russian crewmembers and mission control personnel
participated. Issues examined included Changes in mood and group social Climate over time, displacement of group tension to
outside monitoring personnel, cultural differences, and leadership roles. Findings were based on the completion of a weekly
questionnaire that included items from the Proﬁle of Mood States, the Group Environment Scale, and the Work Environment
Scale. An examination of issues investigated in both studies revealed much similarity in ﬁndings. There was little support for the
presence of Changes in levels of mood and group Climate over time, and no evidence for a “3rd quarter phenomenon”. Both studies
also provided evidence for the displacement of negative emotions to outside personnel in both crewmembers and mission control
personnel. There were similar patterns of differences between Americans and Russians and between crewmembers and mission
control personnel. Finally, in both studies, the support role of the leader was related to group cohesion among crewmembers,
and both the task and support roles of the leader were related to cohesion among mission control personnel. Thus, in these four
areas, the 188 study substantially replicated the ﬁndings from the earlier Shuttle/Mir study, suggesting that common psychosocial
issues affect people engaged in on—orbit space missions.
