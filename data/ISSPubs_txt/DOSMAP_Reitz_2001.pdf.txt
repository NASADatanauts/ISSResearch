"7","CONCLUSIONS
The data given are by far not complete, they are based
on a quick 100k on the records. Next step in the
evaluation is to take into account the altitude/attitude
data of the ISS and magnetic ﬁeld data. No data of the
passive detectors could be given, since these need ﬁrst
to processed according standardised procedures. The
comparison of the data With such of the other
instruments is one of the major tasks towards a
complete understanding of the radiation ﬁeld
characteristics inside the 188.
