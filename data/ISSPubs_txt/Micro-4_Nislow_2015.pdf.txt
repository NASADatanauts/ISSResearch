Spaceﬂight is a unique environment with profound effects on biological systems including tissue redistribution and musculoskeletal
stresses. However, the more subtle biological effects of spaceﬂight on cells and organisms are diﬂﬁcult to measure in a systematic,
unbiased manner. Here we test the utility of the molecularly barcoded yeast deletion collection to provide a quantitative assessment
of the effects of microgravity on a model organism. We developed robust hardware to screen, in parallel, the complete collection
of ~4800 homozygous and ~5900 heterozygous (including ~1100 single-copy deletions of essential genes) yeast deletion strains,
each carrying unique DNA that acts as strain identiﬁers. We compared strain ﬁtness for the homozygous and heterozygous yeast
deletion collections grown in spaceﬂight and ground, as well as plus and minus hyperosmolar sodium chloride, providing a second
additive stressor. The genome-wide sensitivity proﬁles obtained from these treatments were then queried for their similarity to a
compendium of drugs whose effects on the yeast collection have been previously reported. We found that the effects of spaceﬂight
have high concordance with the effects of DNA-damaging agents and changes in redOX state, suggesting mechanisms by which
spaceﬂight may negatively affect cell ﬁtness.

FIGURE 2: Biological processes enriched amongst genes associated with ﬂight-speciﬁc ﬁtness defects at different time points in the homozygous
deletion series. Each node represents a signiﬁcantly enriched gene ontology (GO) biological process (hypergeometric test P s 0.01). A circle
node indicates enrichment at 14 generations compared to 7 generations (the ﬁrst time point), a square node indicates enrichment at 21
generations compared to 7 generations, and a diamond node indicates enrichment at both 14 generations and 21 generations (see Methods).
Node size is proportional to the signiﬁcance of enrichment [—10g10(P)]. Node color indicates processes that share genes (see Methods) and
summary labels are shown for nodes of the same color. Edges indicate 2 50% gene overlap between connected processes; width is proportional
to the degree of overlap. Each bar plot provides ﬁtness defect (FD) scores for genes that contribute to the enrichment ofprocesses with the same
node color as the plot border. Speciﬁcally, the length of a bar is proportional to the 10g2(abundance7G /abundance14G/21G), where abundanceyG
represents the abundance of the corresponding gene deletion strain at )2 generations (see Methods). An “”x on the bar indicates that the
abundance of the strain lowers to background level at later time point.
