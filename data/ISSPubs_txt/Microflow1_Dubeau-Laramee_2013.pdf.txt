ADVANCES in ﬂow cytometry have mostly increased the complexity of ﬂow cytome-
ters and requirement for training, in parallel with improvements on performance.
While there are trends in miniaturization and portability, the development of micro-
ﬂuidic ﬂow cytometers is still at an early stage (1—5) and these instruments are just
emerging to the market as potential commercial technologies. Although commercial
small systems such as the Guava easyCyte (EMD Millipore), Cyﬂow Cube 6 (Partec),
0r Accuri C6 (Becton Dickinson) now exist, they are still mostly used in a laboratory
environment by trained personnel. The core of ﬂow cytometry instrumentation, the
interrogation ﬂow cell, must be made simple yet robust and the requirement for reg-
ular optics alignment must be removed if the instrument has to be mobile. The ﬂu-
idic system must focus cells or particles in a single ﬁle into the interrogation zone
without bulky and heavy systems producing large volumes of biological waste. The
instrument must be able to withstand shocks, Vibrations, and other environmental
Challenges. Energy consumption, size, mass, and heat produced are other factors in
the way of portability, especially in the context of space ﬂight.
