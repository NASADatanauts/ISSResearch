Chromosome aberration neutron irradiations for the fraction of cells with damaged chromosome 3 yielded a relative biological
effectiveness (RBE) value of 26 i4 for the secondary neutrons. Our results also revealed that secondary
neutrons of low dose rate induced a higher fraction of intrachromosome exchanges than 'y—rays, but the
fractions of inversions observed between these two radiation types were indistinguishable. Similar to the
previous ﬁndings after acute radiation exposures, most of the inversions observed in the present study
were accompanied by other aberrations. The fractions of complex type aberrations and of unrejoined
chromosomal breakages were also found to be higher in the neutron—exposed cells than after 'y—rays. We
further analyzed the location of the breaks involved in chromosome aberrations along chromosome 3,
and observed hot spots after 'y-ray, but not neutron, exposures.
