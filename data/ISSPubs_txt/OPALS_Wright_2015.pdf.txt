Abstract: An adaptive Optics (AO) testbed was integrated to the Optical

PAyload for Lasercornrn Science (OPALS) ground station telescope at the

Optical Communications Telescope Laboratory (OCTL) as part Of the free

space laser communications experiment with the ﬂight system on board the

International Space Station (188). Atmospheric turbulence induced

aberrations 0n the Optical downlink were adaptively corrected during an

overﬂight 0f the 188 so that the transmitted laser signal could be efﬁciently

coupled into a single mode ﬁber continuously. A stable output Strehl ratio

of around 0.6 was demonstrated along with the recovery of a 50 Mbps

encoded high deﬁnition (HD) Video transmission from the 188 at the output

of the single mode ﬁber. This proof of concept demonstration validates

multi-Gbps optical downlinks from fast slewing 10w-Earth orbiting (LEO)

spacecraft to ground assets in a manner that potentially a110ws seamless

space to ground connectivity for future high data-rates network.

"2","1. Introduction

The recent Optical PAyload for Lasereomm Science (OPALS) experiment successfully
demonstrated an optical downlink from the International Space Station (188) to the Optical
Communications Telescope Laboratory (OCTL) telescope located at Table Mountain near
Wrightwood, CA [1]. The 50 Mbps Reed-Solomon, encoded, 0n-0ff keyed (OOK) modulated
1550 nm optical downlink was collected by the 1-In OCTL telescope and the atmospherically
blurred focused spot was received with a large area (200 um diameter) free space coupled
avalanche photodiode detector (APD). Future space to ground optical communication systems
can beneﬁt immensely from much higher date rates in the 10’s to 100-Gbps range that these
links are capable of supporting. To realize this beneﬁt, much smaller active area detectors,
typically single mode ﬁber (SMF) coupled receivers with higher bandwidth, will be required
at the ground station telescope focus. Small telescope apertures can efﬁciently focus light
onto these detectors but that requires the receive aperture to be smaller than the atmospheric
cell size [2] which in turn will compromise the collection area or receiver gain and fail to
support an operational link capability.

A remedy is to use adaptive Optics (AO) correction of the atmospheric turbulence
perturbed phase of the downlink beam wave-front so that near-diffraction limited focus spot
sizes are achievable. AO systems have been routinely demonstrated to improve image quality
in static astronomical observations as well as in imaging LEO Objects for space surveillance
[3,4] but have not been demonstrated in an operational spaee-to-ground optical link in the
Open literature.

We report, for the ﬁrst time to our knowledge, the use Of AO correction of an optical
communication signal from a LEO platform to a satellite tracking ground station. When
tracking LEO satellites from the ground, the received optical communication signal is
disrupted by a combination of random atmospheric refractive indeX ﬂuctuations and the
relatively fast slew rate of the LEO satellite that effectively increases the transverse wind
speed or rate at which the atmospheric turbulence moves past the ground receiving aperture.
We demonstrate that fast Closed-loop AO systems can be effective in Closing high-bandwidth,
LEO-to-ground optical communications links, even in daytime conditions.

The remaining paper is organized as follows. A notional link budget is presented to
illustrate the critical role AO will play in enabling ultra-high rate spaee-to-ground
communications from a future LEO spacecraft. The experimental setup is then described with
an overview of the OPALS ground station and integration of the AO system provided by The
Boeing Company. The results will then be discussed from an example overﬂight pass on Mar
4, 2015 followed by a second downlink opportunity on May 19, 2015 that culminated in the
validation of the optical link as in the original OPALS demonstration.

2. Notional power budget

A 5 cm diameter unobseured transceiver transmitting 500 mW Of 1550 nm laser power over a
range of 1200 km is presumed for a power budget resulting in an incident irradianee of
approximately 58 nW/In2 at the ground aperture. A 400 km altitude LEO spacecraft at 75°
zenith angle relative to the ground station was used. The large zenith angle is Chosen in order
to increase the link contact time. Reasonable Optical transmission and wave-front error losses
are assumed at either end of the link. Table 1 shows the net received power as a function of
the ground aperture diameter in the ﬁrst two columns.

The split loss required in order to allocate 220 nW {—36.6 dBm) 0f downlink power for
A0 correction is shown in the third column and was Chosen to be consistent with the power
required by the AO system described below. Ground apertures less than 10 em do not collect
sufﬁcient power. Assuming 10 photons/bit for differential phase shift keying (DPSK)
modulation reported in the literature [5], —42.9 dBrn optical power will be required for
downlinking 40 Gb/s. The link margin corresponding to this requirement is shown in the
fourth column of Table 1B. A portion of margin will be consumed in coupling to single mode
ﬁber, fading and implementation losses. Conservatively allocating 10 dB for such losses
would still leave healthy margin for 60-100 cm receiving aperture diameters that can be used
either to increase data rate or range.

The Fried parameter r0, as low as 4.5 cm for daytime at 1550 11m and 75° zenith angle
occurs (based on data gathered at Table Mountain, CA), will result in D/r0 values of 7-22 for
30-100 cm ground aperture diameters [6]. This will result in (D/r0)2 (10’s to 100’s) spatial
modes spread over ~D/r0 times the diffraction limited spot diameter of ~0.98*(?t/r0) with 9» =
1550 11m. Without A0 for correcting the atmosphere induced phase errors, single mode ﬁber
coupling of the required Optical power is not Viable. Since future LEO-to-ground services
would need to Operate night and day for the 90th percentile Clear sky atmospheric conditions,
the notional power budget underscores the critical role that AD can play in achieving ultra-
high rate data services.

3. Experiment

3.] Overview OfOPALS experiment

Details of the OPALS experiment have been published elsewhere [7]. The ﬂight system was
built by JPL as a low cost technology demonstration and included a two aXis
azimuth/elevation gimbal, a telecommunications derived ﬁber based master oscillator (DFB
laser with external modulation) power ampliﬁer laser transmitter, and a silicon Charge
coupled device (CCD) sensor for tracking. The laser collimator and camera were conﬁgured
as a bi-statie optical head. The avionics, including the 2.5 W laser transmitter were installed
in a eonvectively cooled sealed air container to allow the use Of low cost commercial Off-the-
shelf (COTS) avionics in space. The laser output ﬁber cable was fed through the sealed
container and routed up the gimbal t0 the optical head. The OPALS ﬂight system was
delivered Via a SpaeeX launch and installed on an Express Logistics Carrier (ELC) pallet 0n
the 188 in April, 2014. The output beam has a conservatively large full angle divergence of
approximately 1.0 mrad to ensure sufﬁcient received power at the ground station. The OCTL
ground station implemented a rnulti-bearn beacon comprised of four 976 nm laser diodes with
2.5 W per beam. The downlink signal was received by the APD and stored following Clock
and data recovery. The stored ﬁles were processed with a software decoder in order to recover
the transmitted information. File transmissions 0n the Optical link included HD Video ﬁles,

during day and night conditions over the typical 2 min pass. The pass duration was
constrained by the geometry of the ﬂight system placement on the ISS and laser safety
considerations prohibiting illumination of any 188 structure [1].

3.2 A0 receiver system

The OPALS ground system at the OCTL was modiﬁed with the addition of a compact AO
system test bed provided by The Boeing Company, El Segundo, CA. This AD system,
developed by Jeff Barchers and purchased from SAIC in 2007, incorporates a specially
designed self—referenced interferometer (SR1) wave-front sensor (WFS) and a Boston Micro
Machines 1000-actuator MEMs deformable mirror (DM) with a direct-drive DM controller.
The WFS includes a 19 kHz frame-rate FLIR InGaAs array camera which enables high-
bandwidth AO operation. A polarization controller is incorporated into the AO system which
adjusts the downlink signal polarization prior to the SR1 in order to maintain the desired
power splitting in the SR1 during the downlink pass. The advantage of the SR1 WFS over
other AG systems such as the Shack—Hartrnann based wave-front sensor, is the ability to
correct high levels of turbulence at fast frame rates since the atmospherically-distorted phase
is directly measured and applied to the MEMS—DM without need for wave-front
reconstruction [9]. The optical path to the APD detector was replaced with relay optics
coupling the OPALS downlink to the AO system as shown in Fig. 1. The telescope pupil was
imaged on the AO system entrance in a collimated beam. The output is an atmospherically-
corrected beam that was split between a tracking camera that measured the corrected Strehl
ratio and SMF-28 ﬁber with 10.4 urn rnode ﬁeld diameter for recording power and
communications. For the communication link, a commercial low noise ampliﬁer (LNA) was
spliced onto the output ﬁber along with a two stage temperature tuned narrow band ﬁber
Bragg grating ﬁlter followed by a SMF 0C1 receiver that consisted of a PIN detector
integrated with a transirnpedance ampliﬁer (TIA). The 3 GHz Bragg grating ﬁlter was
inserted to improve detection SNR of the optical communications signal and was required to
track the center frequency of the Doppler-shifted optical signal from the 188. The ﬁlter was
manually temperature tuned during the pass to optimize performance and match the ﬂight
laser wavelength that could potentially drift as there was not enough signal on the ﬁlter
monitor port for autonomous control.

Initially the AO correction was demonstrated in static ground-to-ground links over a 1.6
km atmospheric path. A remotely placed laser transmitter allowed beam alignment and tuning
of the AO system parameters. Only power in ﬁber (PIF) measurements with the SMF output
for recording power were performed at this stage in order to verify that the minimum OPALS
downlink power would be adequate to operate the AO system. Approximately 220 nW of
incident power was coupled into the AO system, 90% of which was utilized by the AO
system. At this power level, full lock of the AO system was achieved. Several experiments
were then conducted during 188 overﬂights with the OPALS ﬂight system in order to verify
AO system performance on the space-to-ground link with the objective of quantifying the
PIF. This is in turn would determine that sufﬁcient power, on the order of a few nano-Watts,
could be achieved to close a communication link. After this was successful, the
communication receiver was added and tested by downlinking a Video ﬁle.

4. Results and discussion
During operation, the AO system senses and corrects the wave-front distortions present in the
laser downlink signal. The A0 system was manually enabled by operator when sufﬁcient
downlink power was received on the wave-front sensor. The A0 system maintained good
correction as long as there was sufﬁcient signal strength on the WFS camera. Data taken from
a single pass veriﬁed that with the OPALS downlink signal, the AO system was locked over
an entire pass duration of 134 seconds. The 188 was tracked from 200 elevation through a
maximum elevation angle 0f 600 in this case on Mar 4, 2015 at a local time of 2:54 pm with
clear skies. Typical results of the output far ﬁeld spots on the tracking camera are shown in
Fig. 2, without and with the AO 100p closed. The A0 system ti1t tracking was switched off
during open loop measurements although telescope tracking was still operating. The open
loop far ﬁeld spot image shows the effect of the higher order wave-front distortions 0n the
down link signal that are corrected by the AO system. The PIF was sampled at 10 Hz for 1
second at 6 second intervals and is shown in Fig. 3 along with measured Strehl ratios and pass
elevation angle. The plotted Strehl ratios are computed by the AO system using the residual
error between the instantaneous residual wave-front measured by the SR1 WFS and a ﬂat-
wave-front calibration phase value. As indicated in the ﬁgure, observed Strehl ratios during
closed loop operation averaged ~0.6 over the pass. A Strehl ratio of 1 represents ideal beam
quality and the value of 0.6 demonstrates good wave-front correction. Without AO correction
the Strehl ratio was < 0.02. The A0 open loop and A0 closed loop PIF probability
distribution for the pass is shown in Fig. 4. The improvement in ﬁber coupled power is
evident in the ﬁgure, with a 16dB improvement in the mean and a narrow distribution of 8dB

for future downlinks that will be used to normalize the power at the AO system and to
determine the ﬁber coupling efﬁciency both open and closed loop. It was not operational for
the current data sets. One of the constraints in our experiment was the low mean PIF of 2—3
nW since most of the received downlink power is used to achieve lock of the AO system. It
should be noted that the OPALS experiment was not designed to be operated with an A0
system but was used to demonstrate the feasibility of using AC on an optical downlink from a
fast slewing LEO satellite. In an operational application, the link would be designed such that
the higher required powers can be coupled into the ﬁber receiver, by narrowing the beam
divergence on the transmit beam for instance.
Fig. 2. Tracking camera output of AO system showing open and closed loop case.

The ﬁnal communication link test was performed by capturing the downlink signal
through the LNA and narrow band ﬁlter on May 19, 2015 at 9:45 am local time under clear
sky conditions. The received signal for the pass in which the communication link was tested
was somewhat weaker than the pass shown in Figs. 3 and 4. The exact reason for the lower
power incident into the AO system was not identiﬁed though different atmospheric conditions
or poorer pointing performance by the ﬂight system could easily account for the variation. As
a result, the data link was more intermittent. The full HD Video was reconstructed in post
processing and the BER, smoothed with a 1 second moving average, was measured. Because
a software Reed-Solomon decoder can count the number of bit errors it corrects, it can be
used to monitor the Bit Error Rate (BER) of the underlying uncoded link. For the two-minute
OPALS pass, the BER of the uncoded optical channel is shown in Fig. 5. Gaps are evidence
of the intermittent nature of the link. Points are also given in the graph for the times when
there was not enough signal on the WFS for the AO system to correct the wave-front. During
the gaps, link performance was not good enough to establish code-word synchronization, or
the code-words contained too many errors. During this track, about 27.5% of the recorded
data was decodable. The intermittency of the communication channel shown by the gaps in
the BER is not only due to the AO system losing lock due to low received signal power but
also due to the inadequate temporal tuning of the ﬁber Bragg grating (FBG) ﬁlter required to
match the narrow ﬁlter band-pass with the Doppler-shifted downlink wavelength and the
delayed clock and data recovery each time the link has to be re-established. These times
correspond to lack of detected BER even when there was sufﬁcient signal on the WFS for
closing the AO loop. Although these contributed to the limited link performance, a full HD
Video transmission was successfully accomplished during the pass which was the success
criteria for the original OPALS experiment and validates the feasibility of using AC on a
LEO-to-ground optical downlink.

5. Summary
AO correction was performed on the OPALS downlink signal directly Via a SR1 based AO
testbed with the corrected signal input to a SMF coupled communication receiver consisting
of a LNA and temperature tuned narrow bandwidth ﬁlter and PIN photodiode. The
performance of the system was characterized by the AO loop providing consistently high
Strehl and reduced PIF signal ﬂuctuations during LEO satellite downlink tests.
Reconstruction of an HD Video signal as in the original OPALS demonstration was also
possible and demonstrates the ability to perform a communication link through the AO
system. This represents the ﬁrst published demonstration of AO correction on a LEO-to-
ground optical communication signal and paves the way for high rate, multi-Gbps optical
downlinks with LEO satellites and seamless connection to terrestrial ﬁber networks.
