Abstract
Solid—state Slit Camera (SSC) is an X—ray camera onboard the MAXI mission of the International
Space Station. Two sets of SSC sensors View X—ray sky using Charge—Coupled devices (CCDs) in 05—12 keV
band. The total area for the X—ray detection is about 200 cm2 which is the largest among the missions of
X—ray astronomy. The energy resolution at the CCD temperature of —70 0C is 145 eV in full width at the
half maximum (FWHM) at 5.9keV, and the ﬁeld of View is 10 .5 (FWHM) X 900 for each sensor. The
SSC could make a whole—sky image with the energy resolution good enough to resolve line emissions, and
monitor the whole—sky at the energy band of < 2 keV for the ﬁrst time in these decades.
