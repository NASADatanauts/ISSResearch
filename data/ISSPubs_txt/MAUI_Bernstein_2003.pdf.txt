OH(A—>X) emission bands have been observed in the molecular beam jets produced by Space Shuttle engine
eXhaust using the GLO imager spectrograph located in the payload bay. Spectra were collected at a resolution
of 4 A for both daytime and nighttime solar illumination conditions, all at an altitude of ~390 km. A spectral
analysis is presented that identiﬁes and quantiﬁes four separate OH(A) excitation processes. These include
(i) solar-induced ﬂuorescence of the OH(X) in the exhaust ﬂow, (ii) solar-induced photodissociation of H20
in the exhaust at the strong Lyman-OL solar emission line (1216 A), (iii) solar-induced photodissociation of
H20 in the far UV, at shorter wavelengths than Lyman-OL, and (iV) luminescent collisions between atmospheric
species and exhaust constituents, most probably the reaction 0 + H20 —> OH(A) + OH(X). Process (i)
produces a very rotationally cold and spectrally narrow component due to the rapid cooling of the OH(X) in
the supersonic expansion of the exhaust ﬂow. Processes (ii) and (iii) produce extremely excited OH(A), not
well characterized by thermal Vibrational or rotational distributions. The O + H20 chemiluminescent reaction
has a substantial activation energy, 4.79 eV, and is only slightly above threshold for the ram geometry, Where
the engine exhaust is directed into the atmospheric Wind. Evidence for process (iV) is observed in the night
ram but not the night perpendicular exhaust atmospheric interaction, consistent With the threshold energy.
Through the use of a nonequilibrium spectral emission model for OH, the integrated intensity, spectral
distribution, and OH(A) internal state Characterization for each of the above processes was deduced. Additional
conﬁrmation of the analysis is provided through the use of a model simulation of the space experiment to
predict the total integrated intensities for processes (i) and (ii), for Which the underlying spectroscopy, absorption
cross sections, and solar excitation intensities are well established. Analysis of process (iii) has established,
for the ﬁrst time, a value for the far-UV conversion efﬁciency of absorbed photons to OH(A) photons of
0.26, Which is twice the established value for Lyman-OL. Under the assumption that O + H20 collisions are
the source of process (iv), the analysis has established a chemiluminescence cross section at ram conditions
of 1.7 X 10‘2 A2. Evidence of OH(A) emission bands from predissociated Vibrational levels suggests that the
total reaction cross section for process (iV) may be signiﬁcantly higher. While this cross section assumes a
single-step reaction of O With H20, the possibility of a two-step process of O With other plume species has
yet to be explored.
