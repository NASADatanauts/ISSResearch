The purpose of the paper is to develop a simplified calculating method for dose estimation in cosmonaut’s
body using minimum quantity of measurements based on the analysis of dose distribution in human body
obtained in the spherical phantom onboard the International Space Station (155) during long-term orbital
ﬂights. The calculating method allows considerable decreasing of the labor to prepare the detectors and
measure ionizing cosmic radiation doses in spaceﬂight. The presented results are based on data obtained in
serial measurements in Service Module and module ""Piers-I "" 0fISS using tissue equivalent spherical phantom.
The measurements were performed with thermoluminescence detectors. General duration of the experiments
carried out during expedition 155-8, 9, 15, I6 is 710 days.
