Abstract

As part of the Materials International Space Station Experiment 7 (MISSE 7), two
experiments called the Polymers Experiment and the Zenith Polymers Experiment were ﬂown on
the exterior of the International Space Station (188) and exposed to the low Earth orbit (LEO)
space environment for 1.5 years. The Polymers Experiment contained 47 samples, which were
ﬂown in a ram 0r wake ﬂight orientation. The objectives of the Polymers Experiment were to
determine the LEO atomic oxygen erosion yield (Ey, volume loss per incident oxygen atoms,
given in 01113 /at0m) 0f the polymers, and to determine if atomic oxygen erosion of high and low
ash containing polymers is dependent on ﬂuence. The Zenith Polymers Experiment was ﬂown in
a zenith ﬂight orientation. The primary objective of the Zenith Polymers Experiment was to
determine the effect of solar exposure on the erosion of ﬂuoropolymers. Kapton H® was ﬂown in
each experiment for atomic oxygen ﬂuence determination. This paper provides an introduction to
both the MISSE 7 Polymers Experiment and the MISSE 7 Zenith Polymers Experiment, and
provides initial erosion yield results.

Introduction

Materials used in spacecraft design are often exposed to threats in LEO space environment,
such as atomic oxygen (A0) interaction, ultraviolet radiation (UV), micrometeoroid and debris
impacts, charged particle radiation, temperature effects and thermal cycling. These threats can
result in embrittlement and degradation of exposed materials, threatening their performance and
durability.

Of these threats, arguably the most prominent is AO erosion. Atomic oxygen is formed
through photodissociation of molecular oxygen by short-wavelength UV radiation (>5.12 eV,
<243 11m) from the sun (Ref. 1). At spacecraft velocities (~7.7 km/s), a number of chemical
NASA/TM—2013-217848 1

"6","reactions with surface molecules can occur, including elastic scattering, scattering with partial or
full thermal accommodations, recombination, or excitation of ram species (Ref. 2). These
reactions are Vigorous enough to cause bond breakage, oxidation, and consequent material
erosion. Exposure to LEO AO atmosphere causes structural degradation and problems with
functionality. Therefore, it is essential to quantify the erosion yield (Ey) which is the volume lost
per incident oxygen atom (om3/atom) of spaoe-eXposed polymers. Even materials protected from
atomic oxygen can be susceptible to A0 erosion. Imperfections in the substrate surfaces of
atomic oxygen protected materials, such as microscopic scratches or dust particles, can cause
defects in the respective protective coatings (Ref. 3). These defects provide a pathway for A0
degradation and undercutting erosion of the substrate.

Another LEO threat to spacecraft materials is solar UV radiation, which has a typical
wavelength of 0.1 to 0.4 micrometers (Ref. 4). UV radiation is energetic enough to cause the
breaking of organic bonds such as C = C, C = O, and C-H as well as other functional groups
(Ref. 5). A molecule is raised to an excited state when an organic molecule absorbs a photon of
UV radiation; bond dissociation can occur if the molecule acquires enough energy at the excited
state. Depending on the temperature and physical properties of the materials, the dissociated
radical species are reactive intermediates, with the capability of diffusing several atomic
distances from their point of origin and can participate in further reactions (Ref. 5). Solar
radiation often results in bond breakage in materials as well as threats to functionality and
stability of the materials. Of interest to this study is whether solar radiation can have an impact
on the erosion of materials.

As part of the Materials International Space Station Experiment 7 (MISSE 7), two
experiments called the Polymers Experiment and the Zenith Polymers Experiment were ﬂown on
the exterior of the International Space Station (188) and exposed to the low Earth orbit (LEO)
space environment for 1.5 years. The primary objective of the Polymers Experiment was to
determine the LEO atomic oxygen erosion yield (Ey, volume loss per incident oxygen atoms,
given in om3/atom) of the polymers and the primary objective of the Zenith Polymers
Experiment was to determine the effect of solar exposure on the erosion of ﬂuoropolymers. This
paper provides an introduction to both the MISSE 7 Polymers Experiment and the MISSE 7
Zenith Polymers Experiment, and provides initial erosion yield results.

Materials International Space Station Experiment (MISSE) Overview

MISSE is a series of experiments that have ﬂown on the exterior of the International Space
Station (188). The overall obj eotive of the MISSE ﬂight experiments is to analyze the durability
and stability of materials in the space environment in order to both determine the best-suited
materials for space applications and to gain knowledge about material characteristics in order to
predict the longevity of new materials and components that could potentially be used in the
future. Individual ﬂight experiments are ﬂown in containers called Passive Experiment
Containers (PECs) that allow for exposure to the space environment. The PECs are closed during
launch to protect the samples. Once on orbit, the PECs are opened baok—to-baok and exposed to
the space environment for the duration of the mission (Ref. 3). The PECs are placed in a
ram/wake or a zenith/nadir orientation. The orientation highly affects environmental exposure.
The ram facing PEC will receive a high ﬂux of directed A0 and sweeping solar exposure. A
zenith facing experiment will receive a low ﬂux of grazing arrival A0 and the highest solar
exposure. Wake surfaces receive very low AO ﬂuxes and solar radiation similar to ram
experiments.

"7","The MISSE 7 Polymers Experiment and Zenith Polymers Experiment were ﬂown and placed
on the exterior of the International Space Station (188) during the STS-129 Shuttle mission on
November 23, 2009. The experiments were placed in two MISSE PECs, one of which was ﬂown
in a zenith/nadir orientation (designated as MISSE 7A Zenith Experiment) while the other was
ﬂown in a ram/wake orientation (designated as MISSE 7B Polymers Experiment). Once
positioned, the experiments remained in low Earth orbit (LEO) for approximately 1.5 years, until
they were retrieved during the STS-134 Shuttle mission on May 20, 2011. Figure 1 shows
MISSE 7A and 7B as imaged during the STS-130 mission in February 2010.

MISSE 73 Polymers Experiment

The MISSE 7B Polymers Experiment was a passive experiment that contained 44 samples,
which were ﬂown in both the ram and wake ﬂight orientations in the MISSE 7B PEC. The two
objectives of the Polymers Experiment were: 1) to determine the LEO atomic oxygen erosion
yield (Ey, volume loss per incident oxygen atoms, given in cm3/atom), of the polymers and 2) to
determine if atomic oxygen erosion of high and low ash containing polymers is dependent on
ﬂuence. Thirty-seven of the samples were ﬂown in the ram orientation, exposing them to high
A0 and solar radiation. Seven samples were ﬂown in the wake orientation, exposing them to
solar radiation with minimal A0. The high and low ash containing samples were exposed to
varying levels of AO ﬂuence by the inclusion of very thin sacriﬁcial Kapton ﬁlm covers.

Tables 1, 2, and 3 below provide a list of 20 MISSE 7B Polymers Experiment samples
analyzed for mass loss based Ey, along with sample ID, sample size, ﬁlm thickness, number of
layers ﬂown (to allow mass measurements to be made in the event that erosion of more than one
layer would occur) and ﬂight orientation (ram or wake exposure). The majority of samples were
ﬂown in two trays: Tray B7-R which held 15 — 1” (2.54 cm) square samples, shown in Figure 2,
and Tray N5-R which held 16 — 0.75” (1.905 cm) square samples, shown in Figure 3. Samples
B7-12 - B7-15 in Figure 2, and N5-9 — N5-11 in Figure 3 were part of other MISSE 7
experiments.

Kapton H® was ﬂown as part of the Polymers Experiment for atomic oxygen ﬂuence
determination in the ram direction. In addition, numerous samples were ﬂown in Al foil holders
which were taped directly to the baseplate using thermal control tape to maximize sample

was ﬂown on the top of a small Atomic Oxygen Scattering Chamber and hence was ﬂown with a
0.127” (0.323 cm) diameter hole in the center. The results of the taped and tensile samples, and
samples that are not characterized for mass-loss based 011 By are not discussed in this paper.
Comparison of Ey values from other MISSE ﬂight experiments will be discussed in future work.

The MISSE 7B Polymers Experiment included samples from the Japan Aerospace
Exploration Agency (JAXA), Towson University, Montana State University, NeXolve
Corporation, ATK Space, NASA Langley Research Center (LaRC) and the National Institute of
Aerospace.

MISSE 7A Zenith Polymers Experiment

The objective of the Zenith Polymers Experiment was to determine the effect of solar
exposure on the Ey of ﬂuoropolymers in the zenith orientation under high solar/low AO exposure.
This was accomplished by comparing atomic oxygen ﬂuence ratios to solar exposure, including
samples ﬂown as part of other MISSE polymer experiments, such as the MISSE 7B Polymers
Experiment. Whether or not there is a synergistic effect of solar radiation on AO erosion is a
concept that is a highly debated subject in the Space Environmental Durability community
(Ref. 6).

The experiment consisted of 15 square polymer samples, 1”X1” (2.54 cmz), ﬂown in the
MISSE 7A “Z” tray. The speciﬁc polymers ﬂown are listed in Table 3 along with sample ID,
sample size, ﬁlm thickness and number of layers ﬂown. Kapton H® was ﬂown for atomic oxygen
ﬂuence determination in the zenith direction. Samples of Al-FEP and silvered-Teﬂon FEP (Ag-
FEP) were included in order to determine the effects of metallization on AO Ey. Four program
speciﬁc samples were also included: JWST sunshield material (Si/2 mil Kapton E/VDA), Orion
LIDS Seal O-ring samples and two atomic oxygen and vacuum ultraviolet (VUV) radiation

Erosion Yield and Atomic Oxygen F luence Determination

The erosion yield (Ey) 0f the MISSE 7 ﬂight samples was determined using mass loss
measurements. The equation to ﬁnd the By of a ﬂat (non-stressed) sample calculates the volume
10st per incident atomic oxygen atom:

E AM (1)
y _ pAF
Where
AM = dehydrated mass loss (g)
p = polymer density (g/cm3)
A = exposed surface area (01112)
F = atomic oxygen ﬂuence (atoms/cmz)

The A0 ﬂuence (F) is can be determined by measuring the mass loss of a Kapton H Witness
sample because Kapton H has a well characterized erosion yield (3.0 X 10'24 cm3/at0m) in the
LEO environment (Refs. 7 to 10). The atomic oxygen ﬂuence for the samples can be calculated
by solving Equation 1 for F and using the Kapton H mass loss value and density.

Experimental Procedures
Mass Loss Determination

When using mass loss data to obtain accurate erosion yield measurements, it is critical to
recognize the hydroscopic (absorbing up to 2% of their weight in moisture) properties of many
polymer samples, including Kapton. This causes ﬂuctuations in mass With corresponding
humidity and temperature. It is therefore imperative that samples be fully dehydrated (i.e., in a
vacuum desiccator) before measuring mass for both pre-ﬂight and post-ﬂight measurements.
NASA/TM—2013—217848 7

"
"12","All MISSE 7 ﬂight samples were dehydrated in a vacuum desiccator with a mechanical
roughing pump. The samples were placed under vacuum in the desiccators at a constant pressure
of 0-100 mtorr (0-0.013kPa) for at least 72 hours prior to weighing. In order to keep all the
samples under vacuum during the weighing process, the desiccator would be put back under
vacuum immediately when an individual sample was removed for weighing.

Duration of time under vacuum, relative humidity and temperature in the room were recorded
prior to each set of weighing. For each sample, time at which the sample was removed from the
desiccator, times at which samples were weighed, and sample mass were also recorded. Previous
tests determined that the mass of a dehydrated sample was not affected by quickly opening a
desiccator to retrieve another sample and putting it under vacuum again, which allowed multiple
samples to be dehydrated and weighed together in sets.

The average of three mass readings was used to calculate mass loss, which was determined
by subtracting the average post-ﬂight mass from the average pre-ﬂight mass. Pre-ﬂight mass
measurements were obtained using a Mettler Balance 3M. Post-ﬂight mass measurements were
taken using a Sartorius ME 5 Microbalance.

Density Determination

The densities of the samples were based on density gradient column measurements of
polymers for the MISSE 2 PEACE Polymers experiment (Refs. 6, 11, and 12). The density
gradient columns for the PEACE experiment were created in 50-mL burets with solvents of
either cesium chloride (CsCl) and water (H20), for less dense polymers, or carbon tetrachloride
(CCl4) and bromoform (CHBr3), for more dense polymers. Glass standards of known densities
were placed in the column and allowed to settle, and then small pieces of various polymers were
placed in the columns. A curve was ﬁt to the positions and known densities of the glass
standards. A plot of the positions of the test polymers on the curve yielded density values for
each material.

Where possible, the same batch of material was used for MISSE 7 as was used for MISSE 2.
Manufacturers” densities were used for Vespel, PVC, PMP, PES, Torlon, PVOH, CN, CORIN,
Vectran Mesh, and Kapton E, as they were not ﬂown as part of the PEACE experiment.

S urface Area Determination

The exposed surface area of the samples was generally determined by taking three different
width measurements and three different length measurements of each sample tray opening with
MaX-Cal electronic digital calipers. The average width was multiplied by the average length to
calculate the square opening. However, the trays have rounded corners with a 0.062 inch
(0.15748 cm) radius. Therefore, 0.02129 cm2 (the area of the four rounded corners) was
subtracted from each square area to get the actual exposed sample area.

For two irregularly shaped samples on the NS-R tray, PVOH (N5-13) and urethane coated
Vectran Mesh (N5-16), AutoCAD computer design software was used to trace the surface area
from a photograph of the sample taken with a Sony digital camera. An example of the photo
trace on the Vectran mesh sample is shown in Figure 5 below.

Sample Stacking
For weighing, the samples were divided into 2 different parts. Part A consisted of the single
top layer and Part B was made up of all additional layers. Part A and Part B were weighed
separately post-ﬂight. This way, only Part A needed to be weighed post-ﬂight for samples with
less than one layer of erosion.
Optical Microscopy
Optical microscopy was used to document select samples. The pictures were taken at
magniﬁcations 0f 7.5x to 20X with an Olympus SMZ stereo-zoom optical microscope equipped
with a Canon digital camera.
Results and Discussion
Mass Loss Verification
The mass of the MISSE 7 control samples were obtained with the Sartorius ME 5
Microbalance used for post-ﬂight massing and were found to be consistent with the pre-ﬂight
masses of the same samples taken with the Mettler Balance 3M.
Post-flight Inspection
B7-R Tray
Upon initial inspection post-ﬂight, the B7-R tray showed discoloration and some sample
degradation. This can be seen by comparing the post-ﬂight photo of the B7-R tray, shown in
Figure 6, t0 the pre-ﬂight photo, shown in Figure 2. The Kapton ﬁlms covering PVF (B7-2 and
B7-3) were shown to have been completely eroded away. Samples exhibiting discoloration post-
ﬂight included FEP/PTFE/POM/PEO (B7-4), Kapton H/Mylar/PE/PG (B7-5), AO Pinhole
Camera (B7-7), Kapton H (B7-8), Vespel (B7-9), and TiO2/A1203/FEP (B7-11). Discoloration of
samples can be attributed to erosion or radiation darkening. The FEP/PTFE/POM/PEO (B7-4)
and Kapton H/Mylar/PE/PG (B7-5) samples, made for recession depth measurements, are not
reported in this paper. Metal samples B7-12 - B7-15 are part of another experiment.

The PVC sample (B7-10) also was found to have changed from a clear ﬁlm to a very dark
color, as shown in Figure 7. It was also eroded though at one edge and was curled up; hence, the
Ey will be greater than the value determined. An impact site, formed by collision with
micrometeorite or space debris, was discovered on the PVC sample and is shown in Figure 8.

During initial post-ﬂight inspection, several samples in the NS-R tray showed signiﬁcant
discoloration and some sample degradation. This can be seen by comparing the post-ﬂight photo
of the NS-R tray, shown in Figure 9, t0 the pre-ﬂight photo, shown in Figure 3. Samples showing
discoloration included PE (NS-l), PES (N5-3), Kapton HN (N5-6), and Torlon (N5-12). An

Atomic Oxygen Fluence and Solar Exposure
The mass loss, surface area, density, erosion yield values, and computed ﬂuenee values are
shown in Table 5 for the ram Kapton H ﬂuenee sample (B7-8) and the zenith Kapton H ﬂuenee
sample (2-8). The atomic 0Xygen ﬂuenee for the MISSE 7B ram tray was determined to be
4.22 X 1021 atoms/emz, and the atomic 0Xygen ﬂuenee for the MISSE 7A zenith tray was
determined to be 1.58 X 1021 atoms/emz. Similar ram ﬂuenee values (4.2i0.1 X 1021 atoms/emz)
have been reported based on mass loss and thickness loss of Kapton HN (Ref. 13).

Estimates of solar eXposure in equivalent sun hours (ESH) have been determined for the
MISSE 7 ram, wake and zenith surfaces. The ram surface received an estimated 2,400 ESH and
the wake surface received an estimated 2,000 ESH based 011 UV diode measurements on
readings from ram and wake trays, respectively, monitored by the Lead-Free Technology
EXperiment in Space Environment (LTESE) (Ref. 13). Computations 0f the 0f zenith solar
eXposure have been conducted by Naval Research Laboratory (NRL) and were determine to be
apprOXimately 4,300 ESH (Ref. 14).
Erosion Yield Values
Ram Samples
Tables 6 and 7 provide sample ID, material, total mass loss, surface area, density, AO ﬂuenee, and
erosion yield for the ram B7-R and ram NS-R trays, respectively. In the B7-R tray, samples with the
highest Ey values and therefore the least durable included Kapton H (B7-8), Vespel (B7-9), and PVC
(B7-10). Because the PVC sample was eroded through at one edge and curled up, as shown in Figure 7,
the reported erosion yield is a lower bound. The polymer sample with the lowest erosion yield was the
TiOz/A1203 coated FEP sample (B7-11).

The Ey 0f the white Tedlar samples (B7-1, B7-2, B7-3) were analyzed. While B7-1 was
ﬂown as the sample uncovered, B7-2 and B7-3 were ﬂown with Kapton H covers 0.5 mil and
1.0 mil thick respectively, which altered the ﬂuence each white Tedlar sample received.
Factoring in the ﬂuence to erode each Kapton H ﬁlm, ﬂuence vs. Ey were plotted along with the
By of a MISSE 2 sample (Ref. 6) and a line of best ﬁt was graphed, as shown in Figure 17. As
can be seen, the By decreases with increasing AO ﬂuence. This is attributed to a buildup of AO
durable TiOz particles on the surface of the samples with increasing AO exposure. The Ti02 can
protect the underlying material from erosion, thus decreasing the By with increasing AO ﬂuence.
White Tedlar results are further discussed in Banks 2012 (Ref. 15).

In the NS-R tray, the polymer sample with the highest erosion yield (most erosion) was CN
(N5-14). Because the sample eroded all the way through during ﬂight, the true Ey 0f the CN
sample will be higher than the calculated Ey in this experiment. Other samples with notably high
erosion yields included Kapton HN (N5-6), PE (NS-l), PMP (N5-2), and PVOH (N5-13).

The polymer sample with the lowest erosion yield was CORIN (N5-15), an A0 resistant
polymer. Other samples with low erosion yields included Al-FEP and the urethane coated
Veetran mesh, samples that are commonly used in spacecraft applications.

Erosion yield values for Kapton HN covered with a 0.5 mil Kapton H cover (N5-7) and
Kapton HN with a 1.0 mil Kapton H cover (N5-8) were found to have signiﬁcantly lower erosion
yields than expected. Even more surprising was that the three Kapton HN samples (N5-6
included) showed a trend of increasing Ey with increasing ﬂuenee. The reason for this is
currently unknown.

Zenith Samples

Tables 8 provides the sample ID, material, total mass loss, surface area, density, AO ﬂuenee,
and erosion yield for the zenith “Z” samples. The polymer sample in the zenith tray with the
greatest Ey was PE (2-1 1). Other samples exhibiting high erosion yields included ECTFE (2-6)
and CTFE (Z-3). Samples with the lowest Ey include the three coated samples: A1203/FEP (2-14)
and TiOz/Ale3/FEP (2-15) and Si/2 mil Kapton E/VDA (Z-12).

Determination of the effect of UV radiation, and corresponding temperature effects, on the
By of polymers ﬂown in both ram and zenith directions can be made for PE, FEP and
TiOz/Ale3/FEP. The Ey of the PE on the zenith tray, which received approximately 1.8X the
ESH as the ram tray, was twice as high as the By of PE on the ram tray. The Ey of Teﬂon FEP on
the zenith tray was an order of magnitude higher (12X) than the By on the ram tray. And,
although the values were very small, the By of TiOz/A1203/FEP on the zenith surface was
approximately 18X greater in the zenith direction. These results indicate that solar radiation and
corresponding temperature effects can play a signiﬁcant role in polymer functionality and
exacerbates degradation and therefore erosion of polymers in the space environment. It is desired
to compare the By of these samples to similar polymers ﬂown on previous MISSE missions, and
other space exposure ﬂight experiments.

Summary and Conclusions

MISSE 7, which contains the Polymers Experiment and the Zenith Polymers Experiment,
ﬂew on the 188 for 1.49 years. Mass loss, density, surface area, and ﬂuenee were determined to
calculate the erosion yield of 34 samples ﬂown as part of these two spaceﬂight experiments.
Samples with the highest erosion yields included CN (N5-14), PMP (N5-2), PE (Z-ll, N5-1),
Kapton H (Z-8, B7—8, N5-5). Samples with the lowest erosion yields included TiOz/A1203/FEP
(B7—11, Z-15), A1203/FEP (Z-14), Si/2 mil Kapton E/VDA (Z-12) and urethane coated Veetran
Mesh (N5-16).

Samples that ﬂew on both N5-R (ram) and zenith trays exhibit much higher Ey values on the
zenith tray (with more solar exposure and resulting higher average temperatures), indicating that
solar exposure and therefore solar radiation play a Vital role in polymer durability and intensify
polymer degradation in space.

13. SUPPLEMENTARY NOTES
14. ABSTRACT
As part of the Materials International Space Station Experiment 7 (MISSE 7), two experiments called the Polymers Experiment and the
Zenith Polymers Experiment were ﬂown on the exterior of the International Space Station (188) and exposed to the low Earth orbit (LEO)
space environment for 1.5 years. The Polymers Experiment contained 47 samples, which were ﬂown in a ram or wake ﬂight orientation.
The obj ectives of the Polymers Experiment were to determine the LEO atomic oxygen erosion yie1d(Ey, volume loss per incident oxygen
atoms, given in cm3/atom) of the polymers, and to determine if atomic oxygen erosion of high and low ash containing polymers is
dependent on ﬂuence. The Zenith Polymers Experiment was ﬂown in a zenith ﬂight orientation. The primary objective of the Zenith
Polymers Experiment was to determine the effect of solar exposure on the erosion of ﬂuoropolymers. Kapton H (DuPont, Wilmington, DE)
was ﬂown in each experiment for atomic oxygen ﬂuence determination. This paper provides an introduction to both the MISSE 7 Polymers
Experiment and the MISSE 7 Zenith Polymers Experiment, and provides initial erosion yield results.
