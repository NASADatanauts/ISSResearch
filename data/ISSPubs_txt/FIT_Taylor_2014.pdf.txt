Abstract
Space travel presents unlimited opportunities for exploration and discovery, but requires better understanding of the
biological consequences of Iong-term exposure to spaceflight. Immune function in particular is relevant for space travel.
Human immune responses are weakened in space, with increased vulnerability to opportunistic infections and immune-
re|ated conditions. In addition, microorganisms can become more virulent in space, causing further challenges to health. To
understand these issues better and to contribute to design of effective countermeasures, we used the Drosophila model of
innate immunity to study immune responses in both hypergravity and spaceflight. Focusing on infections mediated
through the conserved To” and Imd signaling pathways, we found that hypergravity improves resistance to Toll-mediated
fungal infections except in a known gravitaxis mutant of the yuri gagarin gene. These results led to the first spaceflight
project on Drosophila immunity, in which flies that developed to adulthood in microgravity were assessed for immune
responses by transcription profiling on return to Earth. Spaceflight alone altered transcription, producing activation of the
heat shock stress system. Space flies subsequently infected by fungus failed to activate the Toll pathway. In contrast,
bacterial infection produced normal activation of the Imd pathway. We speculate on possible linkage between functional
To|| signaling and the heat shock chaperone system. Our major findings are that hypergravity and spaceflight have
opposing effects, and that spaceflight produces stress-related transcriptional responses and results in a specific inability to
mount a Toll-mediated infection response.
