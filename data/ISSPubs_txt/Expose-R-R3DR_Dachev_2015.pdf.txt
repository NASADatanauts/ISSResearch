Abstract: The aim of the paper is to present the time proﬁle of cosmic radiation exposure obtained by
the radiation risks radiometer-dosimeter (R3DR) during the ESA exposition facility for EXPOSE-R mission
(EXPOSE-R) in the EXPOSE-R facility outside the Russian Zvezda module of the International
Space Station (188). Another aim is to make the obtained results available to other EXPOSE-R teams
for use in their data analysis. R3DR is a low mass and small dimensions automated device, which measures
solar radiation in four channels and in addition cosmic ionizing radiation. The main results of cosmic
ionizing radiation measurements are: three different radiation sources were detected and quantiﬁed:
galactic cosmic rays (GCR), energetic protons from the inner radiation be1t (IRB) in the region of the
South Atlantic anomaly and energetic electrons from the outer radiation be1t (ORB). The highest daily
averaged absorbed dose rate of 506 uGy day‘1 came from IRB protons; GCR delivered much smaller
daily absorbed dose rates of 81.4 uGy day‘1 on average, and ORB source delivered on average a dose
rate of 89 uGy day‘ 1. The IRB and ORB daily averaged absorbed dose rates were higher than those
observed during the ESA exposition facility for EXPOSE-E mission (EXPOSE-E), whereas the GCR
rate was smaller than that measured during the EXPOSE-E mission. The reason for this difference
is much less surrounding constructions shielding of the R3DR instrument in comparison with the
R3DE instrument.
