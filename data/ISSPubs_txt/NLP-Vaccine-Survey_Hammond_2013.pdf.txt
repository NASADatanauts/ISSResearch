Abstract
To evaluate effects of microgravity 0n Virulence, we studied the ability of four common clinical pathogens—
Listeria monocytogenes, methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), Enterococcus faecalis, and Candida albi-
cans—to kill wild type Caenorhabditis elegans (C. elegans) nematodes at the larval and adult stages. Simultaneous
studies were performed utilizing spaceﬂight, clinorotation in a 2-D Clinorotation device, and static ground con-
trols. The feeding rate of worms for killed E. coli was unaffected by spaceﬂight 0r clinorotation. Nematodes,
microbes, and growth media were separated until exposed to true or modeled microgravity, then mixed and
grown for 48h. Experiments were terminated by paraformaldehyde fixation, and optical density measurements
were used to assay residual microorganisms. Spaceﬂight was associated with reduced Virulence for Listeria,
Enterococcus, MRSA, and Candida for both larval and adult C. elegans. These are the first data acquired with a
direct in vivo assay system in space to demonstrate Virulence. Clinorotation reproduced the effects of spaceﬂight
in some, but not all, Virulence assays: Candida and Enterococcus were less virulent for larval worms but not adult
worms, whereas virulence of MRSA and Listeria were unaffected by clinorotation in tests with both adult and
larval worms. We conclude that four common clinical microorganisms are all less virulent in space. Key Words:

Virulence compared to static / ground controls. <2 indicates Virulence that is not statistically different from static / ground controls. CNE 2 could
not evaluate differences in Virulence due to wide variability in replicates.
