Exposure of phototrophs to 548 days In low

outer space and on early earth

An epilithic microbial community was launched into low Earth orbit, and exposed to conditions in
outer space for 548 days on the European Space Agency EXPOSE-E facility outside the International
Space Station. The natural phototroph biofilm was augmented with akinetes of Anabaena cylindrica
and vegetative cells of Nostoc commune and Chroococcidiopsis. In space-exposed dark controls,
two algae (Chlorella and Rosenvingiella spp.), a cyanobacterium (Gloeocapsa sp.) and two bacteria
associated with the natural community survived. Of the augmented organisms, cells of A. cylindrica
and Chroococcidiopsis survived, but no cells of N. commune. Only cells of Chroococcidiopsis were
cultured from samples exposed to the unattenuated extraterrestrial ultraviolet (UV) spectrum
(>110nm or 200nm). Raman spectroscopy and bright-field microscopy showed that under these
conditions the surface cells were bleached and their carotenoids were destroyed, although cell
morphology was preserved. These experiments demonstrate that outer space can act as a selection
pressure on the composition of microbial communities. The results obtained from samples exposed
to >200 nm UV (simulating the putative worst-case UV exposure on the early Earth) demonstrate the
potential for epilithic colonization of land masses during that time, but that UV radiation on anoxic
planets can act as a strong selection pressure on surface-dwelling organisms. Finally, these
experiments have yielded new phototrophic organisms of potential use in biomass and oxygen
production in space exploration.
