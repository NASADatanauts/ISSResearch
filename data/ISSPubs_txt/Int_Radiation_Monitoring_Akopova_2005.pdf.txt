Abstract
The results of an investigation of radiation environment on board the 188 with apogee/perigee of 420/380 km and inclination
51.60 are presented. For measurement of important characteristics of cosmic rays (particles ﬂuxes, LET spectrum, equivalent
doses and heavy ions with Z 2 2) a nuclear photographic emulsion as a controllable threshold detector was used. The use of
this detector permits a registration of the LET spectrum of charged particles within wide range of dE/dx and during last years
it has already been successfully used on board the MIR station, Space Shuttles and “Kosmos” spacecrafts. An integral LET
spectrum was measured in the range 0.5—2.2 X 103 keV/um and the value of equivalent dose 360 uSV/day was estimated.
The ﬂux of biologically dangerous heavy particles with Z 2 2 was measured (3.85 X 103 particles/cmz).
