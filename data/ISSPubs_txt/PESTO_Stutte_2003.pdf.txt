INTERNATIONAL SPACE STATION (ISS): GERMINATION AND EARLY
DEVELOPMENT
G.W. Stuttel, O. Monje and S. Anderson
ABSTRACT

A series of experiments to determine the effects of microgravity on growth and development of
wheat were conducted during a 73-day period onboard the International Space Station. The experiment
relied upon telescience for the remote operation, monitoring, and management of the experiment.
Growth and development of wheat was measured directly by the ISS crew, estimated from analysis of
telemetry data, and quantiﬁed with digital image analysis. On-orbit germination rates of stowed root
modules containing seed cassettes were greater than 95%. Absolute growth rates of ~4.25 cm per day
were observed in both the ﬂight and ground control plants. F inal height of plants on orbit was
approximately 10% greater than comparable ground controls. The results suggest that early growth and
deveIOpment of wheat can be consistently achieved in long-duration space experiments.
BACKGROUND

Plants have long been proposed as components of bioregenerative life support systems (BLSS)
for long duration space missions in order to regenerate the atmosphere, purify water, and produce food.
An understanding of the fundamental physiological and developmental effects of microgravity on
photosynthesis is essential to the success of these missions (Wheeler et a1., 2002). The Photosynthesis
Experiment and System Testing and Operations (PESTO) experiment was designed to directly measure
photosynthesis of a developing wheat canopy. These data will have application in design and
management of a bioregenerative life support system for long duration missions (e.g. ISS Salad
Machine, Lunar surface habitation module; Mars transit and/or surface mission) could be made (Stutte
et a1., 2001). Inherent in the use of higher plants in a BLSS is the assumption that the plant growth and
development will function the same under microgravity (pg) conditions as under l-g conditions.
Collectively, plant-based microgravity experiments has demonstrated that the primary biological
events associated with plant development— germination, seedling orientation, shoot development,
ﬂowering, pollination, fertilization, seed development, and senescence- occur successﬁilly in
microgravity (Halstead and Dutcher, 1987; Nechitailo and Mashinsky, 1993; Musgrave, et a1., 1998.).

While numerous plant experiments have been performed in microgravity, they are often limited
by the lack of replication, poor environmental control, and limited on-orbit access to data. In fact,
there have been relatively few opportunities to systematically evaluate the microgravity impacts on
regulating initial germination, growth and development of a crop plant under well-controlled,
replicated, environmental conditions in space. The International Space Station provided such an
opportunity. Specialized plant growth chambers are required to conduct plant experiments onboard
138. The Biomass Production System (BPS), a system consisting of four independently controlled
plant growth chambers, was recently ﬂown in 188 for 73 days. The initial ﬂight of the BPS consisted
of two experiments, the Technology Validation Test (TVT) (Morrow et a1., 2001) and the
Photosynthesis Experiment and System Testing and Operations (PESTO). The TVT objectives were to
validate the plant growth system hardware functionality in microgravity (Morrow et a1., 2001; Iverson
et a1., 2002). The PESTO objectives were to determine germination, growth, photosynthesis and
transpiration of dwarf wheat in microgravity (Stutte et a1., 2001 , 2002, 2003). We report in this paper
the effects of microgravity on seed germination and early growth.

CONCLUSION

The advanced image acquisition and environmental control systems incorporated into the BPS
plant growth hardware provided an excellent environmental control condition to determine effects of
microgravity on early stand establishment of wheat. The video imaging capabilities allowed for near-
real time monitoring of plant performance during the mission and the telescience tools developed by
allowed for images to be rapidly accessed on the ground for analysis.

The capability to obtain high resolution, non-destructive measurement of growth from the 188
was also demonstrated. This experiment validated the performance of the environmental control and
image acquisition capabilities of the BPS during spaceﬂight. This research utilized telescience to
manage and interpret data from an experiment being performed on the 188.

This analysis has clearly demonstrated the feasibility of obtaining high germination rates of
wheat seeds that have been stored under ambient conditions for long periods prior to imbibing. These
analyses have also revealed that growth of the initial leaves of wheat were the same in both the ﬂight
and ground treatments. This information will have potentially broad application in the design and
management of “seed cassettes” for plant production systems on the 188 or on longer duration space
missions (e.g., Mars transit/surface mission).

"4","Growth analysis. Growth analyses using data obtained from these images was combined and standard
error and mean separation between treatments was determined using Students t-test. Dan Bursch, ISS
Increment IV crewmernber, photographed each row of the growth chamber at harvest and recorded the
number of plants per row. He then down-linked these images and from 188 to Earth. Germination
rates and ﬁnal plant height were then determined. The same procedure was followed with the ground
control treatments.

RESULTS

Initial growth and development was comparable to that observed during germination and early
development of the ground controls (Table 1). Wheat germination in all chambers started on orbit was
greater than 95%. Once seeds emerged, the growth rate of both the ﬂight and ground control plants
was ~4.25 cm per day. The 188 grown plants was approximately 10% taller ground control plants,
although there was difference in total biomass between the ﬂight and ground grown plants (Stutte et
al., 2002). These results are comparable to growth rates observed during pre-ﬂight bioengineering and
hardware biocornpatibility tests in the BPS ﬂight hardware (Stutte et a1., 2000, 2001).

Growth rates of the initial leaves were the same between the ﬂight and ground control plants
following initial germination. The growth rates were linear for both the ISS {height=0. 173*(hr) +
2.337; r2=0.99} and ground control {height=0.176*(hr)+2.21; r2=0.99} treatments for up to 60 hours of
initial growth (Figure 4). The standard deviation was less than 10% for both treatments. The
chronology of divergence in growth rates between the ﬂight and ground control is the subject of
additional analysis.

Image analysis. Digital images obtained from the BPS were used to determine the height of speciﬁc
plants during the experiment. The digital Video camera had wide-angle lens that distorted the image
of plants in the growth chambers. The parallax distortion was determined to be <5% for plants in the
position number 8 for each row (Figure 3). Thus, plant growth analysis was limited to those plants.
The plants were identiﬁed and height determined using reference grid in the chamber to calibrate each
image. No additional correction for image parallax was performed. Each plant was measured until
the leaf tip was out of the ﬁeld of view. This typically occurred 4 to 6 days after imbibing the seeds.
This procedure was repeated for each of the seven wheat plantings on 138 in the BPS ﬂight unit, and
the 9 plantings in the BPS ground control unit. Height data was normalized for variation in
germination time of each seed within a replicate by synchronizing the “0” time with ﬁrst appearance of
the shoot.

Launch and Landing. The PESTO experiment was launched in the BPS to the International Space
Station (188) on 8 April, 2002, onboard STS-110 (Atlantis), transferred to 183 on 13 April, 2002
midway through 188 Increment IV, and returned to Earth onboard STS-l 11 (Endeavor) on 19 June,
2002, for a total of 73 days in space (Figure 1).

Growth Conditions. Triticum aesativum L. cv. USU Apogee were grown in a series of experiments
under controlled environment conditions during Increment IV of the International Space Stations (8
April —19 June, 2002). The plants were grown in a controlled environment chamber, the Biomass
Production Chamber (BPS) developed by Orbital Technologies, Inc., (Madison, WI) to support plant
growth in space (Iverson et al., 2003). The BPS has four independently controlled plant growth chambers
(19 cm x 16 x 19.5 cm) with growing area of 254 cm2 per chamber. Three of these chambers grew
wheat during 188 Increment IV. Each plant grth chamber had 32 plants. There were a total of 7
harvests/6 replantings of wheat on orbit.

Environmental conditions were nominally maintained at 280 pmol m""2 s'1 photosynthetically
active radiation on a 20 hr light/ 4 hr dark cycle at 24°C and 70% RH. Carbon dioxide concentration was
nominally controlled to 1500 hmol mol'l during the light cycle; there was no C02 control during the dark
cycle. Root zone nutrients were provided from slow release nutrient pellets (Osmocotem) mixed into
rooting matrix of 1-2 mm calcined clay (ProﬁleTM). Moisture content in the root zone was controlled to
~50% water holding capacity by using stainless steel porous tubes embedded in the media and
maintaining negative pressure of —0.3 kPa on the tube (Stutte etal., 2000, 2001).

A continuous record of the environmental conditions (C02, temperature, and relative
humidity) experienced by the plants was obtained from the ISS and BPS using CDS 1.02 client
software. These data were used to maintain a BPS ground control chamber in the Orbiter
Environmental Simulator at Kennedy Space Center, FL. The ground controls were harvested
following same procedures as those on orbit and processed separately from the ﬂight tissue. The
wheat plants were harvested when they were 21 days old, except When operational events required an
early or late harvest.

Data and Image acquisition. Digital images were acquired from the BPS video system (Hanse

Electronics MB series MB-l 050C) for each chamber at two-hour intervals and stored for later

retrieval. A total of 3,018 images were obtained from the ﬂight chamber and 3,065 images were

obtained from the ground control chamber. These images were remotely accessed through the NASA

Ames Research Center’s (ARC) Telescience Support Center (TSC) using custom developed

Communication and Data System software (CDS 1.02). The CD8 1.02 software developed through
