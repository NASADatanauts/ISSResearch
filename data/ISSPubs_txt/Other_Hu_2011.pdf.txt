This Letter presents the design and implementation of a highly symmetric rnicroelectrornechanical system sandwich accelerometer using a
double-deVice-layer silicon-on-insulator (D-SOI) wafer. The proof mass of though-wafer-thickness is suspended by eight L—shaped beams
mirror-syrnrnetrically. The suspension system provides ﬂexible mechanical suspension without large chip area consumption. Therefore the
accelerometer is immune from trade-off between sensing capacitance and structure ﬂexibility. The sensing mode (ﬁrst Vibration mode) of
the accelerometer is successfully decoupled from other variation modes that followed. Thereby, the accelerometer is insensitive to the
lateral acceleration and the rotation disturbance. The symmetric bearn-rnass structure is fabricated from both sides of the D-SOI wafer sym-
rnetrically using a combination of anisotropic wet etching and dry etching process. The accelerometer has high opened-loop capacitance
sensitivity of 55 pF/i 1 g. The closed-loop sensitivity is 1.096 V/g and the cross-axis sensitivity is 0.356%. The resolution of the acceler-
ometer is 4.167 ngA/Hz (0—200 Hz at 1 atm).
