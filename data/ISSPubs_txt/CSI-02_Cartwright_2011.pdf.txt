ABSTRACT: We studied the growth of metal-ion silicate chemical gardens under Earth
gravity (1 g) and microgravity (#3) conditions. Identical sets of reaction chambers from an
automated system (the Silicate Garden Habitat or SGHab) were used in both cases. The ,ug V-
experiment was performed on board the International Space Station (188) within 2 '~
temperature-controlled setup that provided still and video images of the experiment F 5 4 . ""
downlinked to the ground. Calcium chloride, manganese chloride, cobalt chloride, and , b ’
nickel sulfate were used as seed salts in sodium silicate solutions of several concentrations. . /
The formation and growth of osmotic envelop es and microtubes was much slower under ,ug “‘ '-
conditions. In 1 g, buoyancy forces caused tubes to grow upward, whereas a random “ '
orientation for tube growth was found under ,ug conditions. ‘ {5“
