Spaceﬂight-lnduced lntracranlal HypertenSIon
Alex P. Michael; Karina MarshaII-Bowman
INTRODUCTION: Although once a widely speculated about and largely theoretical topic, spaceﬂight-induced intracranial hypertension
has gained acceptance as a distinct clinical phenomenon, yet the underlying physiological mechanisms are still poorly
understood. In the past, many terms were used to describe the symptoms of malaise, nausea, vomiting, and vertigo,
though longer duration spaceﬂights have increased the prevalence of overlapping symptoms of headache and visual
disturbance. Spaceﬂight-induced visual pathology is thought to be a manifestation of increased intracranial pressure
(ICP) because of its similar presentation to cases of known intracranial hypertension on Earth as well as the documenta-
tion of increased ICP by lumbar puncture in symptomatic astronauts upon return to gravity. The most likely mechanisms
of spaceﬂight-induced increased ICP include a cephalad shift of body ﬂuids, venous outﬂow obstruction, blood-brain
barrier breakdown, and disruption to CSF ﬂow. The relative contribution of increased ICP to the symptoms experienced
during spaceﬂight is currently unknown, though other factors recently posited to contribute include local effects on
ocular structures, individual differences in metabolism, and the vasodilator effects of carbon dioxide. This review article
attempts to consolidate the literature regarding spaceﬂight-induced intracranial hypertension and distinguish it from
other pathologies with similar symptomatology. It discusses the proposed physiological causes and the pathological
manifestations of increased ICP in the spaceﬂight environment and provides considerations for future Iong-term space
travel. In the future, it will be critical to develop countermeasures so that astronauts can participate at their peak
potential and return safely to Earth.
KEYWORDS: increased intracranial pressure, intracranial hypertension, spaceﬂight, space adaptation syndrome, VIIP, visual
impairment.
