ABSTRACT. This study provides a detailed structural glaciological analysis of changes in surface
structures on the Larsen B ice shelf on the Antarctic Peninsula prior to its collapse in February—March
2002. Mapped features include the ice-shelf front, rifts, crevasses, longitudinal linear surface structures
and meltwater features. We define domains on the ice shelf related to glacier source areas and
demonstrate that, prior to collapse, the central Larsen B ice shelf consisted of four sutured flow units fed
by Crane, lorum, Punchbowl and Hektoria/Green/Evans glaciers. Between these flow units were ’suture
zones’ of thinner ice where the feeder glaciers merged. Prior to collapse, large open-rift systems were
present offshore of Foyn Point and Cape Disappointment. These rifts became more pronounced in the
years preceding break-up, and ice blocks in the rifts rotated because of the strong lateral shear in this
zone. Velocity mapping of the suture zones indicates that the major rifts were not present more than
about 20 years ago. We suggest that the ice shelf was preconditioned to collapse by partial rupturing of
the sutures between flow units. This, we believe, was the result of ice-shelf front retreat during 1998—
2000, reducing the lateral resistive stress on the upstream parts of the shelf and glacier flow units,
ice-shelf thinning and pre-shelf—break-up glacier acceleration.

some cases decades) and a more rapid collapse phase

2001. The rifts later formed the inward limit of ice—shelf collapse (C).

where a three—dimensional relationship can be demon—
strated, these longitudinal surface structures have been '
termed foliation (Hambrey and Glasser, 2003), but we have "":1. '
avoided this term because we cannot demonstrate that these _. ' --
structures are three—dimensional. One of the most striking ' ' '
attributes of these features is their persistence; in many
cases, the longitudinal structures can be followed for ""
N100 km from their origin in tributary glaciers to the ice—
shelf front. We infer that where these features are present,
tributary glaciers are fast—flowing or active and that where
they are absent tributary glaciers are less active.
The physical explanation for the origin of these longi—
tudinal surface structures is unclear. Merry and Whillans
(1993) considered that these features form in relation to
localized high shear strain rates in ice streams near their _
onset areas. Another possibility is that they represent ’shear
zones’ within individual flow units. However, Casassa and
Brecher (1993) found no velocity discontinuities across the ""--—-..,._
boundaries between flow stripes on Byrd Glacier, which I__I_J
suggests that their persistence cannot be explained by lateral ' ' ._:
shear between the stripes. A more likely explanation is that
these structures are created by the visco—plastic deformation __
or folding of pre—existing inhomogeneities, i.e. primary
stratification, under laterally compressive and longitudinally
tensile stresses (Hambrey, 1977; Hooke and Hudleston,
1978). The structures may be formed by this mechanism -
