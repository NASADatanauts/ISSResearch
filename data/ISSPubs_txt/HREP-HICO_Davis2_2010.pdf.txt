LONG—TERM GOALS

The Navy has a requirement to rapidly and covertly characterize the coastal environment in support of

J 0th Strike Initiatives. Over the past 15 years we have demonstrated that spaceborne hyperspectral

remote sensing is the best approach to covertly acquire data 011 shallow water bathymetry, bottom

types, hazards to navigation, water clarity and beach and shore trafﬁeability to meet those
requirements. The long term goal of this work is to put a hyperspectral imager capable of making the
appropriate measurements in space to demonstrate this capability.

OBJECTIVES

The obj ective of this work is to put a hyperspectral imager in space to demonstrate the ability to

covertly acquire data 011 shallow water bathymetry, bottom types, hazards to navigation, water clarity

and beach and shore trafﬁcability. The proposed activities are designed to take avantage 0f the

Hyperspectral Imager for the Coastal Ocean (HICO) currently ﬂying on the International Space Station

(188). As HICO Proj eet Scientist I work to enhance community awareness of the need for and utility

of hyperspectral imaging of the coastal ocean. Our work includes advancing methods of on-orbit

calibration and product validation, and processing and analyzing hyperspectral data of the coastal
ocean. In particular in this study we are using HICO data to characterize the properties of river
systems. Conventional ocean color sensors have 1 km pixels and a few spectral channels; these have
not proven adequate to resolve the complexity of river systems. HICO was designed to sample the
coastal ocean and has 90 m GSD and 90 spectral channels suitable to resolve river systems. To make
the best use of this data we are developing algorithms and approaches for resolving the constituents of
river plumes and other complex systems.

APPROACH

Two tasks are planned for the two year period of this grant (FY2010-2011):

1. Develop, test and evaluate algorithms for deriving optical properties, chlorophyll, suspended
sediments and CDOM for coastal systems including river systems. We will work with MERIS
and HICOTM data and use the Columbia River system and adj aeent coastal waters as a test area
for this work.

regions in China. Once we have developed the algorithms and approaches that work for the
Columbia River we will test and evaluate those algorithms for the Yangtze and other river
systems. The goal is to validate our algorithms and to further our understanding of this important
river and the East China Sea which are rapidly changing due to the development of the Three
Gorges Dam and continued urbanization of China.

WORK COMPLETED

This is the ﬁrst year of this two year proj ect. Our work is focused on the coastal ocean and a maj or

issue for the coastal ocean is that the standard case 1 algorithms used to calculate chlorophyll and other

water properties assume that phytoplankton with an associated level of Colored Dissolved Organic

Matter (CDOM) and water itself are the only optically active components. In coastal waters high

levels of CDOM from rivers and coastal runoff, large phytoplankton blooms, sediments from rivers, or

resuspension from the bottom are all signiﬁcant optical components that need to be considered as part
of the optical signature. For example the standard MODIS and MERIS products give false high

chlorophyll values for the Columbia River Plume (Fig. 1). The MERIS neural network (algal 2)

algorithms are designed for European coastal waters and do a better j ob of separating chlorophyll and

suspended sediments. We are working to modify them for Oregon coastal waters and eventually for
use with HICOTM data. Note also that the 1 km MODIS data does not sample the Columbia River
mouth including the mixing zone that is order 50 km from the coast. MERIS 300 m data does a better
job of imaging the estuary but HICO has 90 m GSD and full spectral data (400 — 900 nm at 10 nm
resolution) is closer to ideal for this example river system.

"4","The Hyperspeotral Imager for the Coastal Ocean (HICO; Corson et a1. 2008) is an imaging
spectrometer based on the PHILLS airborne imaging spectrometers (Davis et a1. 2002). HICO is the
ﬁrst spaoeborne imaging spectrometer designed to sample the coastal ocean. HICO will sample
selected coastal regions at 90 m with full spectral coverage (400 to 900 nm sampled at 5.7 nm) and a
high signal-to-noise ratio to resolve the complexity of the coastal ocean. HICO is sponsored by the
Ofﬁce of Naval Research as an Innovative Naval Prototype (INP), to demonstrate coastal products
including water clarity, bottom types, bathymetry and on-shore vegetation maps. As an INP, HICO
also demonstrates innovative ways to reduce the cost and schedule of this space mission by 80% by
adapting proven PHILLS aircraft imager architecture and using Commercial Off—The-Shelf (COTS)
components where possible.
The HICO program was initiated in February 2006. In J anuary 2007 HICO was selected to ﬂy on the
J apanese Experiment Module Exposed Facility (J EM-EF) on the International Space Station.
Construction began following the Critical Design Review on November 15, 2007. HICO was
completed in July 2008 (Fig. 2) and it was integrated into the HICO and RAIDS Experimental Payload
(HREP) in August 2008. HICO is integrated into HREP and ﬂown with support and direction from
DOD’s Space Test Program. HREP has completed environmental testing at NRL and NASA’s
Marshall Space Flight Center and was shipped to J apan on April 9, 2009. HREP was launched on the
H-2 Transfer Vehicle (HTV) September 10, 2009. The HTV rendezvoused with the 188 on September
17, 2009. HICO was installed on September 23 (ﬁg 2) and collected its ﬁrst images on September 24,
2009. The image quality looks excellent and the team is assessing the calibration and testing
processing systems. Data should be available for distribution by the end of 2010.

For the past year we have been collecting HICOTM data for the Columbia (Fig. 3) and Yangtze Rivers
(Fig. 4). There are many constraints on data collection with this demonstration instrument including
being limited to one image per orbit for data transmission, gaps due to the ISS orbit and operations and
clouds. However, we now have several good images for both rivers and are continuing to collect
imagery at both locations. We are still working out automating the distribution and atmospheric

"6","Yangtze River in China is a major source of sediments and nutrients to the China Sea and Straits of
Taiwan. In a comparison of chlorophyll products from MODIS and HICOTM (Fig. 4) we see the big
picture in the MODIS data, but far more detail in the HICOTM data. Also, note that the MODIS
algorithms fail over waters with high sediments, but the HICOTM data is not saturated and the HICOTM
algorithm returns useful data even in these high sediment waters. Were the MODIS data is not
saturated the match of chlorophyll values is very good.
To validate MERIS and HICOTM data products we have been collecting proﬁles of downwelling
irradianee and upwelling radiance using a Satlantie HyperPRO (Fig. 5). The HyperPRO is a free
falling optical proﬁling system that collects proﬁles of spectral Lu and Ed and ehl ﬂuorescence,
backseatter, T and salinity. The system is calibrated by Satlantie and we use the Satlantie software for
processing including all of the latest corrections based on NIST calibrations. This system produces
high quality measurements of spectral remote sensing reﬂectance (Rrs) for direct comparison to the
HICOTM data after atmospheric correction. The HyperPRO data together with other data collected on
each station including HPLC pigments, productivity, CDOM, suspended sediments are placed in the
MILOCO data base with web access.

A key focus of our effort is to differentiate the river plume from the background signal and to ﬁnd a
rapid way of processing the data to produce a river plume product. The initial focus is to use
techniques that do not need atmospheric correction but directly use the calibrated at sensor radiances.
Nick Tuﬁllaro is leading this effort and testing several approaches.
The starting point for atmospheric correction of a sensor above water radiance is the decomposition,
L‘ILL) : L¢g{}5}—II{}LJLH'|:}L}. (1)
where La accounts for atmospheric and sea-surface reﬂection, LW picks up contributions below the
water surface, and T denotes the transmittance from the water surface to sensor. In developing
5

"
"7","‘indicator maps,” we will consider a slightly different decomposition. Namely, we start by imagining,
at every pixel, the at-sensor radiance we would see if the water was clear, a so-called dark water pixel.
This is an ‘idealized’ quantity, but the difference between this ideal radiance signal, and the observed
signal at sensor, provides information about what is in the water, which is relatively independent of
what is in the atmosphere. Thus it is a good starting point for creating an ‘indicator’ function for what
is in the water.
In our approach a dark water pixel will be deﬁned “empirically,” based on an image, or collection of
images, of a region of interest, and choosing pixels, or patches of pixels, which determine ‘dark water,”
or water free of river plume materials, or other features of interest, for that region. So in practice, the
dark water pixel could contain some background material in the water column that we will consider as
‘clear water,” or a ‘dark pixel,” which is typical for the region. We could call this type of pixel, which
contains some below water signal, a regional dark pixel, but in the following discussion we will just
call it a dark pixel. It is the background signal from which we start any ﬁarther signal processing.
Mathematically we can write this decomposition as:
L_Tm = Lulu]+IILLJLLJH}—L,~?[LJ]. (2)
= LuliHLﬂil. (3)
where LM is the modeled spectrum, and L1 is the ‘indicator’ spectrum, it is simply the residual between
the at sensor radiance minus any modeling we do for the spectrum. If LM is simply chosen as a dark
pixel in the scene than it is what is normally referred to as ‘dark pixel subtraction”, a very simple but
often effective scheme for atmospheric correction. The terms LdOt) and L130») are called the ‘dark
water” and “bright water” contributions to LW(7\.) respectively. The trick to this approach is ﬁnding (a
probably empirical) model of dark pixel spectra that allow us to create a data based decomposition of
LT (7L) to identify one or more dynamic water constituents of interest. To ﬁnd such a model we start by
examining an image from HICOTM of the at-sensor radiance (LIB) for a typical dark water scene, in
this case the waters around Midway Atoll (Fig. 6).
To create an empirical model to ﬁt the ‘dark water” pixels shown by the circles in Fig. 6 we take a
guess at the following functional form:
£th = {twat}. 4.114 (4)
where a and b are model parameters which are to be estimated from the spectral data kn and Lm(7\.n) and
?L] is the ﬁrst value of the wavelength in data set being modeled, a constant. In HICO LIB data sets,
each at-sensor pixel consists 90 radiance values between about 400 nm to 900 nm. The typical swath
size covers approximately 42 km by 190 km, and 500 by 2000 pixels. To ‘model’ the data we limit our
data sets to wavelengths between 450 nm to 900 nm, so in our data sets ?L] = 450 nm and XN = 900 nm.
As expected the model works well for the Midway Image which is in clear waters. We have
subsequently applied it to the Columbia River and Yangtze River HICO images to use it to
differentiate the plume features. Those results are shown in the results section below.

Space Experiment Review Boards (SERBs) and received high rankings. The current ranking for C018
is 4 out of 30 on the 2008 Navy SERB list and 5 out of 62 on the 2008 DoD SERB list. While HICO
data will be 100 m GSD optimal for characterization of optically deep coastal waters, COIS would
provide the 30 m GSD data optimal for optically shallow waters producing products like bathymetry
and bottom types.
RESULTS
The focus of this effort is on the processing and analysis of HICOTM data to demonstrate the utility of
hyperspeetral imaging for characterization of coastal waters. Our efforts are particularly focused on
river systems and we have conducted initial analysis of HICOTM data for the Columbia and Yangtze
Rivers. During this ﬁrst year we have processed an extensive set of MERIS data for the Columbia
River and Oregon Coastal Waters. We have also collected an extensive set of in situ data for
validation of products off the Oregon Coast.
We have also processed the available HICOTM images testing a variety of algorithms to evaluate their
use for river systems. We have applied the Plume Indicator approach described above to 4 images of
the Columbia River (Fig. 7). The results are very encouraging.

"10","We are extending this approach by using more realistic models for removing the underlying spectral
trends from the solar spectrum and the Rayleigh scattering in the atmosphere. Further we are then
using derivative spectra to identify the constituents in the plumes to track and quantify them.

HICO has been on the 188 for one year. Over 1700 images have been collected for sights around the

world. HICO is operating as planned and the initial data products look very good. HICO operations

have been extended to three years. We continue to work With the NRL team on the on-orbit calibration
and validation of HICO. As Proj eet Scientist it is my goal to work With the scientiﬁc community to
make the best possible use of this unique data set.

IMPACT/APPLICATIONS

The long term goal of this work is demonstrate the value of a hyperspectral imager capable of making

the appropriate measurements in space to demonstrate the capability of this technology for the rapid

and covert characterization of the coastal ocean to support naval operations around the world. We are
using data from HICO 0n the 188 to demonstrate that capability. The work completed this year is
another incremental step towards that goal.
