Density waves in a dusty plasma emerge spontaneously at low gas pressures and high dust densities. These
acousticlike wave modes were studied in a radio-frequency discharge under microgravity conditions. The complex
three-dimensional wave pattern shows a spatially varying wavelength that leads to bifurcations, i.e., topological
defects, where wave fronts split or merge. The calculation of instantaneous wave attributes from the spatiotemporal
evolution of the dust density allows a precise analysis of those structures. Investigations of the spatial frequency
distribution inside the wave ﬁeld revealed that the wave frequency decreases from the bulk to the edge of the cloud
in terms of frequency jumps. Between those jumps, regions of almost constant frequency appear. The formation
of frequency clusters is strongly correlated with defects that occur exclusively at the Cluster boundaries. It is
shown that the nonlinearity of the waves has a signiﬁcant inﬂuence on the topology of the wave pattern.
