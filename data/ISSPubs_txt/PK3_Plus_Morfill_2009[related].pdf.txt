Complex plasmas: An interdisciplinary research field
Gregor E. Morfi||* and Alexei V. Ivlev
Max-Planck—lnstitut far extraterrestrische Physik, 85741 Garching, Germany
(Published 2 October 2009)
Complex (dusty) plasmas are composed of a weakly ionized gas and charged microparticles and
represent the plasma state of soft matter. Complex plasmas have several remarkable features:
Dynamical time scales associated with microparticles are “stretched” to tens of milliseconds, yet the
microparticles themselves can be easily Visualized individually. Furthermore, since the background gas
is dilute, the particle dynamics in strongly coupled complex plasmas is Virtually undamped, which
provides a direct analogy to regular liquids and solids in terms of the atomistic dynamics. Finally,
complex plasmas can be easily manipulated in different ways—also at the level of individual particles.
Altogether, this gives us a unique opportunity to go beyond the limits of continuous media and
study—at the kinetic 1evel—various generic processes occurring in liquids or solids, in regimes ranging
from the onset of cooperative phenomena to large strongly coupled systems. In the ﬁrst part of the
review some of the basic and new physics are highlighted which complex plasmas enable us to study,
and in the second (major) part strong coupling phenomena in an interdisciplinary context are
examined. The connections with complex ﬂuids are emphasized and a number of generic liquid and
solid—state issues are addressed. In summary, application oriented research is discussed.

with increasing interest nanocrystal structures (which
gives important Clues about possible size-dependent new
properties) is an important area of physics, linking ma-

perconductivity, and Chemical properties (Zhu et al.,
1987; Gleiter, 1989, 2000; Yokoyama et al., 2005; Tak-

Another important area, where crystal structures play
a role, is the self—assembly of colloids. This feature is
interesting because colloidal crystals can be used for,
e.g., photonics, optical sensors, waveguides, Chemical
sensing, and lithography (Holtz and Asher, 1997; Wijn-
