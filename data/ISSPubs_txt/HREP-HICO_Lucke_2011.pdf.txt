The Hyperspectral Imager for the Coastal Ocean (HICO) is the ﬁrst spaceborne hyperspectral sensor
designed speciﬁcally for the coastal ocean and estuarial, riverine, or other shallow-water areas. The
HICO generates hyperspectral images, primarily over the 400—900 nm spectral range, With a ground
sample distance of 290m (at nadir) and a high signal-to-noise ratio. The HICO is now operating on
the International Space Station (188). Its cross-track and along-track ﬁelds of View are 42 km (at nadir)
and 192 km, respectively, for a total scene area of 8000 kmz. The HICO is an innovative prototype sensor
that builds on extensive experience With airborne sensors and makes extensive use of commercial off—the-
shelf components to build a space sensor at a small fraction of the usual cost and time. Here we describe
the instrument’s design and characterization and present early images from the ISS. © 2011 Optical
