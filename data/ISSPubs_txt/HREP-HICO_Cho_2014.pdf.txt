E“ 1. Introduction

,3 Satellite data have been extenswely used to prov1de information on benthic habitats

3 including seagrass, macroalgae, and coral reefs (Holden and Le Drew 1998; Mumby

E et a1. 1999; Malthus and Mumby 2003; Mishra et a1. 2005; Pasqualini et a1. 2005).

8 Classiﬁcation of benthic habitats through spectral analyses of satellite data provides a
time and resource efﬁcient alternative to the extensive ﬁeld campaigns necessary for
evaluating spatially continuous benthic coverage in a coastal environment (Lidz, Brook,
and Nagle 2008). However, one of the maj or setbacks of benthic remote sensing is that the
composite upwelling radiance from substrates (i.e., seagrass, macroalgae, and bare sub-
strate) is often contaminated with signals from other optically active constituents in the
water column such as chlorophyll-a (chl a) and suspended and dissolved materials
(Mishra et a1. 2005, 2006, 2007). Therefore, isolating the spectral pattern from the benthic
habitats for accurate mapping is a challenging task. Hyperspectral remote sensing has
been shown to be an important tool in distinguishing these patterns by capturing the key
spectral characteristics differences among the targets (Fyfe 2003; Kutser, Vahtniae, and
Metsamaa 2005). Studies conducted by Fyfe (2003) and Kutser, Vahtniae, and Metsamaa

(2005) provide insight into the use of hyperspectral signals in delineating benthic habitat
coverage types.

Seagrass is a group of vascular benthic vegetation that has adapted to live in full
marine salinities and a Vital component of ecological processes, dynamics, and productiv-
ities of coastal ecosystems. Differentiation of the seagrass spectral proﬁle from bare
substrate or macroalgae is complicated because the effects of ‘red absorption by chl a’
and ‘near infrared (NIR) reﬂectance’ by seagrass decrease with increasing water depth
(Cho 2007). This becomes particularly difﬁcult to separate signals of seagrass from
macroalgae since both contain chl a that results in similar spectral patterns.

The key difference between macroalgae and seagrass spectral characteristics has been
identiﬁed within the wavelength regions of green (530—580 nm) and red edge (680—
720 nm) (Fyfe 2003; Kutser, Vahtniae, and Metsamaa 2005). Seagrass-dominated areas,

v compared to macroalgae, would have stronger red absorption by chl a and, therefore,
§ exhibit relatively higher green reﬂectance and a higher and broader peak near 705—
4;; 710 nm (Cho et al. 2013). According to our previous close-range hyperspectral studies
3:13 on submerged aquatic vegetation, the underwater vascular plants have slight, but several
<ﬁ differences in their spectral characteristics from microalgae (Cho, Kirui, and Natarajan
ﬂ 2008). The differences in spectral characteristics between macroalgae and seagrass were
ER evidenced at the NIR band around 708—713 nm in terms of the peak location, magnitude,
5 and width (Cho et al. 2013). In addition, the width of the chl a absorption feature at 665—
E? 675 nm appears to be the key for distinguishing seagrass from macroalgae (Cho et al.
E 2013).

5 The Hyperspectral Imager for the Coastal Ocean (HICO) is a hyperspectral sensor
39 onboard the International Space Station (188), with a high signal-to—noise ratio that can
é facilitate benthic habitat mapping. HICO provides the hyperspectral bands from 400 nm to
g 900 nm that are sampled at 5.7 nm with a spatial resolution of 90 m. The presence of
<3: narrow bands within the wavelength regions that are important for seagrass and macro-
?) algae discrimination (665—680 nm and 708—715 nm) makes HICO suitable for benthic
i)” mapping. Thus far, HICO data have not been tested for distinguishing between seagrass
3 and macroalgae. The primary goal of our study was to develop a novel approach using
: HICO data that can be efﬁciently used to distinguish seagrass and macroalgae signals and
ﬁ help facilitate accurate benthic vegetation mapping. The secondary goal was to compare
g the performance of this approach with conventional supervised and unsupervised classi-
E ﬁcation methods used for benthic habitat mapping. HICO image of the Indian River
E Lagoon (IRL) and ﬁeld survey data were used in our analysis to separate algal chlorophyll
8 signals from seagrass signals.

The IRL was an ideal site for this study because there are abundant ancillary data
collected over two decades that were available for training and validation. The St. Johns
River Water Management District (SJRWMD) has been collecting water quality data since
1989 and surveying seagrass beds using transects since 1994 in IRL. In addition, lagoon-
wide seagrass maps are generated every two years from aerial photography though
SJRWMD. Development of an efﬁcient seagrass mapping technique using satellite data
was also timely for IRL. During the summer of 2011, an unprecedented algal bloom
formed, producing chl a concentrations over eight times (often exceeding 100 ng/L) than
the historical mean in some areas, lasting seven months and spanning the entire northern
IRL (SJRVVMD 2012). As a result, the IRL suffered a loss of over 34,000 acres of
seagrass, in part due to light reduction resulting from the highest recorded phytoplankton
bloom density and spatial expanse ever documented (Phlips and Badylak 2011). This
bloom and associated seagrass decline far exceeded any past events documented in terms

"
"3","122 HJ. Cho et al.

of geographic scale, intensity, duration, and rate of seagrass loss. The 2011 ‘super bloorn’
covered approximately 53,000 hectares of open water (SJRWMD 2012). IRL seagrasses
suffered further from brown tides occurring in 2012 in Mosquito Lagoon, one of the IRL’s
sublagoons. In many areas, the seagrass abundance has not returned to the pre-bloorn
status as of summer 2013. Therefore, accurate and spatially continuous mapping of the
IRL seagrass coverage at regular interval is crucial for conservation and restoration
purposes.

The speciﬁc objectives of this study were to (1) isolate spectral bands that can
distinguish between seagrass and rnacroalgae and (2) map benthic habitats particularly
seagrass and rnacroalgae coverage in IRL using HICO data. The overall approach
included: (a) obtaining and pre-processing HICO data over IRL; (b) developing spectral
models for effective discrimination of seagrass vs. rnacroalgae; (c) benthic classiﬁcation

v using three methods (supervised, unsupervised, and newly developed slope models); and
§ ((1) performance comparison based on accuracy assessments using high-resolution aerial
4;; data and ﬁeld survey data. A new seagrass/rnacroalgae mapping technique using HICO
50 data would improve lagoon-wide benthic mapping capacity which will aid in planning for
:13 seagrass habitat restoration in IRL.

S 2. Study site
B IRL is a 252 km long estuarine system on the Atlantic Ocean side of central Florida, USA
§ (Figure l), with a mean depth of 2 1n and widths varying from 0.5 km to 5 km. The IRL is
5 reported to be one of the most productive and diverse estuaries in North America, largely
#2“ related to its expansive seagrass coverage (Littler, Littler, and Hanisak 2008). The IRL’s
E seagrass community boasts the highest species richness in North America (Virnstein and
$23 Hall 2009). The species-rich, healthy seagrasses and rnacroalgae areas provide a Vital

acre of seagrass beds can support 50 million invertebrates (FFWCC 2003). Florida’s
Department of Environmental Protection estimated that the state’s seagrass communities
supported commercial ﬁsheries valued at over 124 billion dollars in 2000. The area
surrounding the IRL has been undergoing rapid development, resulting in degradation
of the ecological services the lagoon provides. In addition, the recent algal blooms and
mysterious deaths of manatees, dolphins, and pelicans in IRL draw attentions from all
over the nation (Wines 2013). Therefore, accurate mapping and monitoring of seagrass
habitats in IRL is high priority for SJRWMD.
3. Materials and methods
v 3.1. HICO data acquisition and pre-processing
§ HICO image data were collected over IRL (centered at latitude 28.568844, long-
}; itude80.757854) on 21 March 2013 at around 1:55 pm local time at a sensor angle
6:0 of 9.60. The data were initially corrected for geometric and atmospheric distortions by
<ﬁ the Oregon State University who manages and distributes the HICO data (http://hico.
g coas.oregonstate.edu/). Atmospheric correction, one of the most important steps in
5: benthic habitat mapping, was performed using TAFKAA (The Algorithm Formerly
é Known As ATmospheric REMoval (ATREM)). TAFKAA radiative transfer model
E? developed by the US Naval Research Laboratory (Gao et al. 2000; Montes and Gao
E 2004) is based on the earlier ATREM code of Gao and Goetz (1990). The scattering
8 effects are calculated using the second simulation of the satellite signal in the solar
Z? spectrum (68) and user—speciﬁed aerosol model and optical depth. The HICO dataset
E was further pre-processed and analyzed with ENVI Classic 32—Bit Interface software
g (ENVI® 5.0, Exelis Visual Information System, McLean, VA). The HICO data were
<3: provided in a ‘rough geolocated’ format that was reﬁned through the ENVI 5.0
C3 georeference tool into UTM WGS-84. The base map used was the temporally closest
i)” cloud-free Landsat 7 SLC-Off image (3 March 2013) over the study area, provided by
3 the USGS Earth Explorer. The average root mean square error (RMSE) of the geor-
: eferencing process was 0.05.
§ There was a signiﬁcant cloud cover over most of the IRL on 21 March 2013 when the
% HICO data were collected. Iterative self-organizing data algorithm (ISODATA) unsuper-
E Vised classiﬁcation was applied to the image data in order to identify the pixels affected by
E cloud cover and were masked out (Ball and Hall 1965). The ISODATA was run with the
8 following settings: classes: 5—10, maximum iterations: 5, change threshold: 5%, minimum
pixels in class: 100, maximum class standard deviation: 0.25, minimum class distance: 10,
maximum number of merge pairs: 10. Cloud pixels were selected based on regions of
interest (RoI) and excluded from the following analyses. As a result, a geographic subset
within the Banana River and a part of the central IRL area was selected for further data
analyses due to its cloud-free condition and proximity to siX of the long-term seagrass
monitoring stations of SJRVVMD (Figures 1 and 2). Water depth point shape ﬁles were
obtained from SJRWMD (ftp://ftp.sjrwmdeom/IRL/BathymetryO and were stacked onto the
HICO data for bathymetric data incorporation needed for masking out deepwater areas
(areas with no benthic signals). In addition, pixels that were above the mean low tide
mark were classiﬁed as ‘land’. All land and marsh areas in the image were also masked
out in order to enhance the spectral variation across the water pixels using a binary mask
applied to one of the infrared bands (>800 nm). In addition, a vector ﬁle obtained from
Florida Geographic Data Library was applied to mask out the Atlantic Ocean.

>» 3.2. Seagmss survey data
é Annual seagrass transect survey data were obtained from SJRWMD. Transect data
2 surveyed in August 2013 at six of the monitoring sites that fell within the HICO image
‘5 subset were selected and used to identify locations for seagrass beds and areas for
go macroalgae (Figure 2). The seagrass transect data were converted to a point shape ﬁle
g and added onto a base map in ArcGIS® 10.1 (ESRI, Redlands, CA). These points are the
8 individual locations surveyed in the ﬁeld using a 1 X 1 1n quadrat and have been
: documented and categorized for substrate type (seagrass species, macroalgae species,
ﬁ and their percent coverage) along the transect lines (Figure 2). The point data were
5?: added onto the HICO image, with the most recent benthic coverage monitoring data
% (August 2013) incorporated into the attribute table. The survey point data along with
E aerial photography obtained in August 2013 were later used as reference data for end—
Q member collection, classiﬁcation, and accuracy assessment. HICO data were obtained in
March 2013, and the ground truth data were collected in August 2013; however, the
SJRWMD’S seagrass research team conﬁrmed that there were not signiﬁcant changes in
seagrass and macroalgae locations and abundance, particularly in the core study areas,
between March and August in 2013.
3.3. Slope model development
The transect survey points were used as the foundation for understanding the variations in
spectral patterns in the HICO pixels representing each benthic habitat. HICO spectra at
100 selected pixels from ﬁve benthic habitats were extracted and analyzed to ﬁnd unique
features that would help distinguish between seagrass and macroalgae (Figure 3). The ﬁve
classes selected for end—member collection and analysis were: (1) exposed: air—eXposed

cloud—free HICO data using the Z—spectrum function in ENVI. Each spectrum was
exported in the form of an ASCII ﬁle and grouped together for further analysis.
Comparison of the spectral properties between the classes revealed that the red—edge
band near 700 nm can be potentially exploited to distinguish between substrate types
(Figures 3 and 4). First, the within—class variations were low (standard deviations for
macroalgae, mixed beds, seagrass, deepwater, and exposed were 0.003, 0.002, 0.004,
0.003, and 0.011, respectively), indicating the homogeneous nature of the substrate types.

E)” peak was the highest, with the exception of the exposed class. The NIR reﬂectance for
8 seagrass pixels was also higher than Inacroalgae. A close examination of the spectral
: differences between Inacroalgae and seagrass revealed that both algae and seagrass
ﬁ showed chl a absorption minima at 673 nm; however, the NIR peak for Inacroalgae and
F8 seagrass was at 708 nm and 713 nm, respectively. More importantly, the higher magnitude
:3 of the seagrass peak produced steeper slopes on both sides compared to other benthic
E substrate types (Figures 3 and 4). The variations observed in the red and NIR slopes
8 between substrates were further analyzed using derivative analysis.

First and second derivatives were derived from the average spectra for each substrate
for Visual analysis of the red and NIR slopes (Figure 5). The ﬁrst derivative showed that
the red slope between 679.024 nm (HICO band 49) and 690.48 nm (HICO band 51) were
positive and had distinct magnitude for each substrate. For example, seagrass magnitude
was higher than both mixed beds and Inacroalgae (Figure 5A). Similarly, the NIR slope
between 696.208 nm (HICO band 52) and 742.032 nm (HICO band 60) were negative
with the exception of exposed substrate and had a distinct magnitude for each substrate
types (Figure 5A). The second derivative showed similar pattern for the red slope;
however, no speciﬁc pattern that would distinguish the substrate types was observed for
the NIR slope (Figure 5B). In both cases, the crossover in derivative values occurred at
the chl a scattering peak near 700 nm. The derivative analysis provided promising
possibility for using the red and NIR slopes in distinguishing and mapping different
benthic substrate types using HICO data.

either slope can be used to map and distinguish between benthic habitats in IRL using
HICO data. Therefore, the slopes were computed on HICO image data as:

3 Four types of classiﬁcations were performed on the IRL HICO data. The classiﬁcation

55 methods used included supervised spectral angle mapping (SAM), unsupervised

l5 ISODATA classiﬁcation, SlopeRED, and SlopeNIR. Other common classiﬁcation procedures

B such as maximum likelihood classiﬁer (MLC) and decision tree classiﬁer (DTC) were not

g used because of the lack of a robust training dataset for the study site. Most of the ﬁeld

{3 data available for the site were therefore used for classiﬁcation accuracy assessment.

g: 4.1. Spectral angle mapping

C3 Supervised classiﬁcation of the HICO dataset was performed using the SAM algorithm

i)” (Kruse 1998). SAM classiﬁcation relies upon the use of pre-processed radiometrically and

3 atmospherically corrected data so that a relatively ‘pure’ spectrum is present within the

: pixels (end-members). The SAM technique efﬁciently differentiates and groups various

ﬁ spectra present on the reference image by isolating similar spectra, by matching with

g reference spectra. SAM is then able to relate these spectra to the pixel vectors in n-

2 dimensional space (n = number of end-members) — the smaller the angles between spectra,

E the similar they are to each other (Honarmand, Ranjbar, and Shahabpour 2012).

8 Conversely, the pixels that fall further away than the user-speciﬁed threshold are not
classiﬁed (Narumalani et a1. 2006).

The aforementioned ﬁve benthic substrate classes were used for SAM classiﬁcation;
and end-member collection was conducted for the classiﬁcation. This step was different
from the previous step of collecting ASCII ﬁles to create spectral ‘proﬁles’ for the slope
models. High-resolution aerial photography obtained in May 2013 and seagrass transect
data that were taken from June to August 2013 were used to collect the end-members. The
transect points were overlaid onto the HICO image, and percent benthic coverage data
were used to observe what benthic cover type was inﬂuencing each signal. In addition to
the 20 spectra per classes that were used for supervised SAM classiﬁcation, additional 20—
25 points per class were selected for accuracy assessment. The end-members (20 per each
class) were stored as ROIs and were used to conduct the supervised SAM classiﬁcation.
The maximum acceptable angle between an end-member spectrum and a pixel vector (in
n-dimensional space) was kept as 0.1 radians.

4.2. Unsupervised classiﬁcation
The HICO image was also classiﬁed using ISODATA, also known as a squared-error
clustering method (Ball and Hall 1965). This algorithm performs an unsupervised classi-
ﬁcation that aims at grouping pixels belonging to the same cluster that present similar
spectral properties (Tou and Gonzalez 1974). Unlike supervised classiﬁcation, the unsu-
pervised classiﬁcation method does not require extraneous data for initial clustering; and
clusters are determined purely in accordance with the differences in spectral values within
the HICO bands. The ISODATA was performed so that the unsupervised classiﬁcation
result would be compared to the benthic classiﬁcation performance by supervised SAM
and the slope models. The parameters used for the classiﬁcation were classes: 50,
maximum iterations: 7, change threshold: 5%, minimum pixels in class: 1, maximum
class standard deviation: 1.0, minimum class distance: 5 .0, maximum number of merge

3 pairs: 2. The resultant clusters were merged when necessary and labeled with the most

8 appropriate of the ﬁve classes, based on previously constructed end-members used in

”g supervised SAM classiﬁcation.

§ Slope images were created using SlopeRED and SlopeNIR models calculated from the HICO

ﬂ data. Slope thresholds for each substrate and each model were determined from the

g univariate statistics of each class and the distribution of slope values of each class.

63 Average and standard deviations for each slope class were used to determine the lower

7:“ and upper limit to categorize the HICO pixels for each model (Table 2). The slope

E threshold for each model and for each class was chosen as plus/minus one standard

$23 deviation from the mean value plus a constant (Table 3). The constant was used to avoid

‘5 any gaps in threshold limits between classes and to create a continuous range of slope

0&3 threshold for each class. The constant was derived by analyzing the between-class overlap

g from the coincident slope plot.

4.4. Classification accuracy assessments

Classiﬁcation accuracy measurements, including overall accuracy, producer’s and user’s

accuracies, as well as kappa coefﬁcients, were calculated using reference points that were

not used in the supervised classiﬁcation (Jensen 2005). Contingency tables were con-

structed for the four classiﬁcation results (the slope algorithms, SAM, and ISODATA).

5. Results and discussion

5.1. Slope model for benthic classification

Slope models were developed and tested in order to better separate benthic substrate types,

particularly vascular seagrass beds from macroalgae in shallow estuarine environments.
v Spectra of the ﬁve benthic classes (exposed, seagrass, macroalgae, mixed bed, and deep-
5* water) were Visually separable in the red and NIR regions (Figure 4). The magnitude of the
$1, 700 nm peak was higher for seagrass compared to macroalgae (Figure 4) because of the
a combined effect of chl a in the water column and seagrass canopy. Spectral reﬂectance from
:3"" productive waters always shows a narrow peak at or near 700 nm because of absorption on
g both sides — chl a absorption near 675 nm on the red side and water absorption after 710 nm
33 on the NIR side (Mishra et a1. 2012). The magnitude at 700 nm peak increased when
é arranged in the order of increasing chl a concentrations during our preliminary analyses.
‘5 Seagrass species contain higher amount of chl a when compared to the macroalgae species
? (Enriquez and Borowitzka 2010) occurring in IRL (Riegl et a1. 2005; Riegl and Foster
§ 2011). In addition, the NIR reﬂectance for seagrass pixels was also higher than that of
a macroalgae because of the increased scattering by the seagrass leaf structure (Figure 4);
E hence, spectra reﬂectance slopes in the red and NIR were Visually distinguishable between
0) even seagrass and macroalgae substrate types. The apparent variations in positive spectral
E slopes between 679 nm and 690 nm and the negative spectral slopes between 696 nm and
C03) 742 nm in the ﬁrst—derivative graph were distinguishable among the seagrass, macroalgae,
‘33 and mixed beds (Figure 5A), which support the difference in seagrass and macroalgae in
:0 terms of chl a effects and internal cellular structure. The ﬁrst—derivative results were used to
8 determine the wavelengths for slope calculations and to develop the slope algorithms,
3 SlopeRED and SlopeNIR. The second derivatives indicated that the second slope model
E SlopeNIR may not be as efﬁcient as SlopeRED when distinguishing the benthic vegetation
8 covers (Figure 5B). Figure 6 conﬁrms that by displaying the overlaps particularly between
E seagrass and mixed beds and between mixed beds and seagrass. However, Figure 6 still
8 indicated that SlopeRED and SlopeNIR can be effectively used to distinguish seagrass and

macroalgae. The divergence matrix (Table 1) further supported the successful use of the

slope models in distinguishing seagrass and macroalgae.

5.2. Analysis of the three classification results

The performance of the four classiﬁcation methods using reference points from the ﬁeld

seagrass survey data and aerial photography is presented in Tables 5 and 6. The overall

accuracies and kappa coefﬁcients were considerably lower for the unsupervised

ISODATA classiﬁcation compared to the other three methods (Table 5). The low accuracy

for ISODATA was expected because, as Figure 4 indicated, the four spectral classes

including seagrass, mixed beds, macroalgae, and deepwater have very similar spectral

patterns within the wavelength range of 400—900 nm, with the exclusion of ‘exposed’

substrate. Therefore, the 0% producer’s and user’s accuracies for ‘exposed’ class and

E relatively high accuracies for ‘seagrass’ class (Table 6) were unexpected, but it demon-
;3 strated that the unsupervised ISODATA was not an appropriate method to distinguish
E underwater features even in case of partially exposed substrate (Table 6). The accidental
8 high accuracy values for the seagrass class were probably resulted from the large over-
estimation of seagrass areas with the ISODATA classiﬁcation, which increased the prob-
ability of a validation point to fall in a seagrass cluster. In addition, the uneven geographic
distribution and lack of ground truth data in the north portion of the HICO image resulted
in the accidental high accuracy for the seagrass class (Figure 7).

Unsupervised classiﬁcation algorithms have been extensively used in terrestrial
remote sensing; however, they have been rarely applied in coastal aquatic environments
for benthic mapping because the spectral properties of the benthic habitats are contami-
nated by the interference from water column optical properties (Mishra et a1. 2005; J oseph
et a1. 2005). Another reason for the limited use of unsupervised classiﬁcations over coastal
aquatic habitats is the lack of knowledge pertaining to the spectral variations of various
benthic habitat types (Cho, Mishra, and Wood 2012). Without the application of an
accurate water column correction model, unsupervised classiﬁcation would not provide
proper delineation and grouping of benthic habitats (Mishra et a1. 2006).

Figure 7. Benthic habitat maps derived for the study area using the HICO data and the four
classiﬁcation models including SAM, Unsupervised, SlopeRED, and SlopeMR.

SAM classiﬁcation provided a better overall accuracy value and higher kappa coefﬁ—
cient compared to ISODATA (Table 5). The results also showed an improved accuracy in
distinguishing exposed substrate from submerged vegetation (seagrass, macroalgae, mixed
beds classes) or from deepwater substrates (Table 6). However, it still did not serve as a
reliable tool in classifying three benthie types including seagrass, macroalgae, and mixed
beds and showed low producer’s and user’s accuracies (Table 6). The results demonstrate

"
"16","GIScience & Remote Sensing 135
that even advanced supervised classiﬁcation methods such as SAM would perform poorly
in discriminating benthic vegetation types (Vahtniae and Kutser 2013) due to the water
column interference. In addition, the 90 m spatial resolution of the HICO data probably
introduced additional confusion and variations in the benthic vegetation classes. Even
with the use of higher spatial resolutions data from airborne CASI (compact airborne
spectrographic imager) and satellite WV—2 (WorldView-2; 2 m resolution), image-based
supervised classiﬁcation by Vahtniae and Kutser (2013) provided low producer’s and
user’s accuracy values (30—50%) for benthic vegetation, which were comparable with our
study results (Table 6).

The new slope models SlopeRED and SlopeNIR did not pick up the class ‘mixed beds’
(Table 5) as predicted by the statistical and divergence analyses (Figure 6; Table 1).
Nevertheless, this method provided overall accuracies (63—64%; Table 5) greater than the
v other two classiﬁcations and even greater than the benthic classiﬁcation accuracy result
§ (algae, seagrass, and bare substratum) in IRL by using acoustic seaﬂoor discrimination
4; method (~60%; Riegl et al. 2005). Also, the slope algorithms were better to distinguish
3:0 between seagrass and macroalgae substrates, one of the objectives of this study, compared
<ﬁ to SAM or unsupervised methods (Table 6). The low classiﬁcation accuracy for the
ﬁ exposed class with the slope algorithms was again due to the uneven spatial distribution
ER of the ground truth points, similar to the results observed with the unsupervised classiﬁca-
5 tion for the seagrass class. There was not much ﬁeld survey-based or aerial photo-based
ES information on the benthic cover type in north portion of the HICO image data. Therefore,
E supervised SAM classiﬁcation clumped much of those area as ‘unclassiﬁed’ (Figure 7),
8 but the unsupervised ISODATA and slope models produced multiple clusters for those
2? areas, which later were labeled based on the ﬁeld reference points used for SAM
é classiﬁcation (20 points per class). As described earlier, the accidental high accuracy
g values for the seagrass class in Figure 7B were probably due to a small number of ﬁeld
<3: reference points, to label with, in those areas that were clustered as the same group. In this
C3 case, a few reference points were matched with a class used (seagrass), and the larger area
i)” of the same cluster was labeled as seagrass because there were no other reference points
3 that matched with other class labels in the area (Figure 7B). Because of these reasons, a
: signiﬁcant difference was observed between map composites produced by the four
ﬁ classiﬁcation procedures (Figure 7).
g Considering the relatively small HICO image size that was useable (cloud free) for
:3 this study, the 90 m spatial resolution in addition to the limited benthic information at
E some portions in the image, only 20 reference points/class for SAM and 20—25 points/
8 class for accuracy assessment were available. This probably was the reason for the
relatively low kappa coefﬁcient values (Table 5). This can be improved when the entire
lagoon-wide HICO data become available because more ﬁeld data and pixels can be used
throughout the image for both classiﬁcation and accuracy assessment. Nevertheless, the
new slope models performed better in distinguishing benthic vegetation types by picking
up the subtle differences in the red and NIR slopes between vascular seagrass and
macroalgae (Table 6); and the new methods can signiﬁcantly improve the benthic
vegetation mapping when used along with a supervised classiﬁcation method.
According to the graphical and statistical results (Tables 1 and 2), SlopeNIR appeared
to perform better for seagrass vs. macroalgal discrimination, but it is hard to determine
which slope method performed better based on the overall classiﬁcation contingency table
(Table 6). Classiﬁcation maps suggest that SlopeNIR incorrectly classiﬁed much of the
deepwater portion into macroalgae (Figure 7). And along with conventional unsupervised
classiﬁcation, slope model classiﬁcation results should be used with caution in areas with

"
"17","136 HJ. Cho et al.
little reference points available. In summary, the best classiﬁcation results achieved 63—
64% overall accuracy in benthic mapping, which might be considered poor when com-
pared to traditional land use and land cover studies using remote sensing. However, for a
benthic mapping study using orbital remote sensing data and without the application of a
robust radiative transfer model, these accuracy numbers could be considered signiﬁcant. A
radiative transfer model-based protocol could be considered as the best way to map the
benthic habitat; however, it needs a signiﬁcant amount of ﬁeld data including optical data
of the water column, which is frequently missing, difﬁcult to collect, and not economical.
We believe that with the collection of more training site data and ﬁne tuning of the slope
models, the results of this benthic mapping study would improve considerably.
E 6. Conclusion
§ Atmospherically corrected HICO data were used to distinguish and map benthic substrate
3 types in IRL. Hyperspectral sensors such as HICO typically provide detailed spectral
é"" features of targets that can be used in benthic mapping. However, use of the large number
g of highly correlated bands and the narrow short-wavelength bands would not always
5: produce the best classiﬁcation results. This study examined the HICO data to ﬁnd key
é wavelength ranges to distinguish between benthic vegetation types, especially between
E? seagrass and macroalgae. Two slope methods, SlopeRED and SlopeNIR, were developed by
? calculating the slopes between HICO bands 49 and 51 and between HICO bands 52 and
§ 60, which demonstrated the greatest abilities in distinguishing spectral features of seagrass
a and macroalgae. Classiﬁcation accuracies of the new methods for seagrass and macro-
T: algae classes were considerably higher compared with performance of conventional
% ISODATA and SAM classiﬁcation methods that use all bands with redundant information.
3—: Our study demonstrates the advantage of selecting key narrow bands to accentuate the
O subtle differences between seagrass and macroalgae. Results suggest that combining a
ED supervised clustering method and the new slope models, SlopeRED and SlopeNIR, will
% signiﬁcantly improve the accuracy of benthic mapping because supervised classiﬁcation
8 will compensate the slope method application in areas with little reference points avail-
E‘ able. This study is timely because an improved detection technique for accurate mapping
E of seagrass and macroalgae areas in IRL will aid in the ongoing research and management
3 efforts to understand and restore the recent dramatic loss of seagrass habitats during the
E super algal blooms. We conclude that for accurate benthic habitat mapping in estuarine
o environments such as IRL, a few narrow bands on both sides of 700 nm are required in
Q future multispectral satellite sensors.
