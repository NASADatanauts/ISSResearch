ABSTRACT
Spaceflight results in a number of adaptations to skeletal muscle, including atrophy and
shifts towards faster muscle fiber types. To identify Changes in gene expression which
may underlie these adaptations, we used both microarray expression analysis and real—
time polymerase Chain reaction to quantify shifts in mRNA levels in the gastrocnemius
from mice flown on the 11 day, 19 hour STS—108 shuttle flight and from normal gravity
controls. Spaceflight data were also compared to the ground-based unloading model of
hindlimb suspension, with one group of pure suspension and one of suspension
followed by 3.5 hours of reloading to mimic the time between landing and sacrifice of
the spaceflight mice. Analysis of microarray data revealed that 272 mRNAs were
significantly altered by spaceflight, the majority of which displayed similar responses to
hindlimb suspension, while reloading tended to counteract these responses. Several
mRNAs altered by spaceflight were associated with muscle growth, including the PI3
kinase regulatory subunit p85a, insulin response substrate-i, the forkhead box 01
transcription factor, and MAFbx/atrogini. Moreover, myostatin mRNA expression
tended to increase while mRNA levels of the myostatin inhibitor FSTL3 tended to
decrease in response to spaceflight. In addition, mRNA levels of the slow—oxidative fiber
associated transcriptional co—activator peroxisome proliferator associated receptor—
(PPAR) gamma coactivator-1alpha and the transcription factor PPAR-alpha were
significantly decreased in spaceflight gastrocnemius. Finally, spaceflight resulted in a
significant decrease in levels of the microRNA miR—206. Together these data
demonstrate that spaceflight induces significant Changes in mRNA expression of genes
associated with muscle growth and fiber type.

INTRODUCTION

Spaceflight has many consequences on the musculoskeletal system.

Specifically, the unloading due to microgravity results in decreases in muscle mass and
force production capability as well as shifts in muscle fiber type towards a faster
contracting and less endurable phenotype (10). Qualitatively similar decreases in
muscle mass and shifts in fiber type occur in both rats (35) and mice (14), making them
an excellent model with which to elucidate the molecular signaling mechanisms involved
in the skeletal muscle alterations in response to spaceflight. Thus exposure to
microgravity results in decrements in muscle strength and endurance in both humans
and rodents that in humans could adversely affect the ability to perform critical functions
while in space, particularly on long missions.

Ground-based models have also been used to simulate aspects of the
spaceflight environment in rodents. Hindlimb suspension has been used extensively in
rats and mice to approximate the musculoskeletal unloading as well as the cephalic fluid
shift that occurs during spaceflight (27). Rats subjected to hindlimb suspension
approximate the reduction in cross-sectional area and slow-to-fast fiber type transitions
in slow—twitch muscles that are observed in the rats flown in space (reviewed in (26)).
However, other studies suggest that spaceflight induces gene expression Changes in rat
skeletal muscle that are not elicited in suspension models (28). This is in some ways
unsurprising given that there are significant differences between spaceflight and
hindlimb suspension. Specifically, one major difference is that organisms flown in space

typically experience a few hours of reloading before sacrifice, and this reloading may
also influence early events such as signal transduction and gene transcription.

Recently much progress has been made in elucidating the intracellular signaling
pathways governing muscle mass and fiber type. Flux through the phosphatidyl inositol-
3 (Pl3) kinase/Akt/mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) pathway has been
demonstrated to increase protein synthesis (reviewed in (11)), and to decrease protein
degradation through inactivation of members of the FoxO family of transcription factors
(39). This pathway is activated by insulin-like growth factor-I (lGF-l) and can also be
influenced by mechanical loading (15), but definitive studies have yet to be done on the
effects of spaceflight on activity and/or expression of genes involved in Pl3-
kinase/Akt/mTOR signaling.

Skeletal muscle mass is also negatively regulated by the myostatin pathway.
Inactivation of myostatin through naturally occurring or targeted mutations results in
dramatic muscle hypertrophy in mice, cattle, and humans (16). Myostatin acts in a
paracrine/autocrine loop by binding to members of the activin Rll receptor family, most
notably ActRllb (19), and decreases myoblast proliferation (42) differentiation (18, 33),
and protein synthesis (40) while increasing expression of protein degradation genes in
vitro (24). Increased myostatin expression has been reported in a number of conditions
of unloading atrophy, including spaceflight and hindlimb suspension in rats (7, 17), but
to date little is known about the effects of unloading on other myostatin-associated
genes.

In addition, an exciting recent finding has been the identification of mioroRNAs
and their role in regulating gene expression in a number of species and a variety of

tissues. MicroRNAs are small (~21 nt), evolutionarily conserved, nonooding RNAs with
the ability to regulate gene expression on a wide scale through the binding of the
microRNA to sequence—specific sites within target mRNAs (6). Several mioroRNAs have
been identified which regulate skeletal muscle differentiation and gene expression (6)
and which demonstrate muscle fiber type-speoific expression (23). Currently, however,
little is known regarding the expression of mioroRNAs during conditions of unloading
atrophy such as spaceflight.

The purpose of the present study was threefold: first, in order to better
understand the gene expression Changes underlying the functional decrements in
response to spaceflight, we examined the effects of spaceflight on mRNA expression in
gastrocnemius muscle by utilizing both a global microarray approach and a candidate
gene approach using quantitative real—time polymerase Chain reaction (QRT-PCR).
Second, we compared the effects of spaceflight on global mRNA expression to those of
hindlimb suspension for a comparable length of time. Third, because all spaceflight
studies contain the possible confound of several hours of reloading upon re—entry and
landing, we evaluated the effects of the 3.5 hours of reloading (experienced by the
spaceflight mice prior to sacrifice) on mRNA expression of suspended mouse muscle.
We hypothesized that both spaceflight and hindlimb suspension would be associated
with shifts in mRNA expression that would favor myostatin signaling and decrease Pl3
kinase/Akt/mTOR signaling and thus would favor protein degradation over protein
synthesis and decreased myogenic cell proliferation and differentiation over cell growth,
and that reloading would reverse these effects.

METHODS & MATERIALS
Microgravity exposure. All animals were housed individually in animal enclosure
modules (AEM; developed by NASA Ames Research Center (Moffett Field, CA)) with
access to food and water ad libitum. The muscles used in the spaceflight study came
from the same mice as those previously described (12, 14, 30): female C57BL/6J mice
were divided into animal enclosure module (AEM) ground controls and space flight (SF)
groups. Animals were maintained on a 12 h light—dark cycle with all animal care,
treatment, and housing density within National Institutes of Health (NIH) guidelines. All
protocols were approved by the appropriate institutions (University of Colorado at
Boulder, Amgen Inc., NASA Ames Research Center, and NASA Kennedy Space
Center). SF animals were flown on the middeck of the space shuttle Endeavour (STS-
108/UF-1) for 11 days and 19 h beginning December 5, 2001. AEM animals were
housed at Cape Canaveral Air Force Station’s Hangar L orbital environmental simulator
for 11 days and 19 h with conditions mimicking the shuttle’s middeck temperature,
humidity, and C02 levels. As mentioned previously, the module containing the
spaceflight mice experienced an increase in temperature during flight which may have
contributed to differences in eating and drinking behavior as previously mentioned (12,
14, 30). AEM and SF animals were sacrificed at 77 days of age, with SF animals being
sacrificed 3.5—4 h after landing. The triceps surae (gastrocnemius, plantaris, and soleus)
of SF and AEM animals were removed and attached to corkboard with optimal cutting
temperature media (Sakura Finetek, Torrance, CA) and then frozen in liquid nitrogen
cooled isopentane for other purposes (12). The medial section of the gastrocnemius

was isolated for RNA analysis. Gastrocnemius muscle (n = 4/group) was subsequently
used for DNA microarray analysis.
Hindlimb suspension and reloading. For the ground-based unloading/reloading
studies, mice were divided into three groups (n=5/group): control (CON), suspension
(SUS), and suspension plus reloading (REL). The control group was normally housed
three per cage. The suspension and reloading groups were suspended for 12 days to
match the STS—108 flight. Tai| suspension was performed using previously described
methods (37). Briefly, the mice were suspended at approximately a 30° angle by taping
the tail to a plastic dowel attached to a swivel apparatus. This apparatus is attached to a
guide wire running the length of the cage. The mouse is able to access all areas of the
cage because of the swivel between the dowel and the wire. The suspension animals
were sacrificed while suspended at the end of the 12 days. Suspended mice were
unsuspended for 3.5 hours at the end of the 12 days of suspension and allowed to
engage in normal loading for this period to match the time between landing and sacrifice
for the STS—108 mice. All animals were 77 days of age at the time of sacrifice. This
protocol was approved by the Clemson University Animal Care and Use Committee.
The triceps surae of all animals were removed by dissection, weighed, and snap frozen
in liquid nitrogen.
Preparation of total RNA. Total RNA was prepared from tissue samples by Trizol
extraction followed by purification using RNeasy columns (Qiagen Inc., Valencia, CA).
Quality and purity of the RNA preparations were assessed by spectrophotometric

determination of A260:A28O ratios and by quantification of 28S:18S ribosomal RNA
ratios using a Bioanalyzer 2100 (Agilent Technologies, Palo Alto, CA).
Synthesis of biotin-Iabeled cRNA targets and hybridization to Affymetrix
GeneChips. Synthesis of double stranded CDNA, in vitro transcription of biotin-Iabeled
cRNA targets and fragmentation of target cRNA were performed as outlined by
Affymetrix protocols (Affymetrix, Santa CIara,CA). Fragmented cRNA samples were
hybridized overnight at 450C to Affymetrix Mouse Expression 430A GeneChips. Post
hybridization washing and phycoerythrin-streptavidin staining and fluorescence
scanning were performed using Affymetrix instrumentation in accordance with
manufacturer protocols. The resulting scans (CEL files) were deposited in the MUSC
DNA microarray database (2); these can be accessed from the database using the
project identifiers _1112123225.418684 (gastrocnemius) and _1120601249.362999
(suspension/reload). Microarray data were also deposited in the NCBI Gene Expression
Omnibus repository under the accession number GSE10533.
Analysis of DNA microarray data. Gene hybridization intensities were normalized
using Robust Multichip Average (5) implemented with the ArrayQuest web-based
analysis system (3). Normalized hybridization values were imported into the analysis
tool dChip 2005 (21) for subsequent analysis. mRNAs differentially expressed in
response to spaceflight were identified using both statistical (p<0.05 for unpaired
student’s t—test) and fold Change (fold Change >1.5) thresholds. The fold change metric
was Chosen to ensure that the detected expression differences were sufficiently large to
8

be validated by PCR-based approaches. False discovery rate, estimated by iterative
comparison of randomized sample groupings, approximated 1.5% for these differential
expression criteria. Differential expression in response to suspension, reloading or the
combination of suspension plus reloading was evaluated by pairwise comparison
(Student’s t—test, unpaired). Statistical power analysis using Power Atlas (29)
determined that alpha (p) <0.05 provided the most robust outcomes in terms of
proportion of expected differentially expressed genes discovered (>25%) versus
proportion of true positives in the genes discovered (>75%). Gene functional categories
were assigned following review of gene ontology annotations as well as functional
information available through NCBI Entrez Gene. Hierarchical Clustering of differentially
expressed mRNAs was conducted using the centroid linkage model with distance metric
1—Correlation.
Quantitative PCR. QRT-PCR was used to confirm expression Changes observed in the
microarray analysis. First strand CDNA was prepared from total RNA (1 ug) using the
iScript CDNA Synthesis Kit (Bio—Rad, Hercules, CA) according to manufacturer
specifications. CDNA preparations were diluted to 200 HI, and 2 HI were used in 25 HI
reactions with the i0 SYBR Green Supermix reagent (Bio—Rad). Reactions were
amplified in an iCycIer Real-Time PCR Detection System (Bio—Rad). The resulting data
were analyzed with the Gene Expression Analysis macro (Bio—Rad), which derives an
unsealed expression value for the gene of interest by first calculating a relative
expression value and then normalizing it by division with the geometric mean of relative
expression values found for control mRNAs (Hprt1 and B—actin)..

9

"
"10","Spaceﬂight effects on mouse skeletal muscle gene expression

QRT-PCR was also used to quantify mRNA levels of myostatin, its receptor
ActRllb, and its primary binding/inhibiting protein FSTL3 in all of the spaceflight and
AEM samples, as previously described (1). The reverse transcription (RT) reaction was
carried out using 0.5 pg of RNA using the CDNA Archive kit (Advanced Biosystems)
according to the manufacturer’s protocol. Primer and probe sets for MSTN, ActRllb,

FSTL3, and B-actin Taqman® analysis were obtained from Applied Biosystems. These
real—time PCR procedures were run in triplicate to correct for variances in loading. In
addition, a standard curve ranging from 10 to 0.001 pg dilutions of mouse TA CDNA was
run in duplicate for every assay to produce a standard curve for quantification. All
values are expressed as the mean of the triplicate measure for the experimental
(MSTN, ActRllb or FSTL3) divided by the statistical mean of the triplicate measure of [3-
actin, which was run in duplex, as a normalization control. B—actin mRNA levels were
unaffected by spaceflight (data not shown).

Finally, for analysis of miR-1, miR-133a, and miR-206, RT was performed using a
microRNA specific primer according to manufacturer’s instructions (Applied Biosystems,
Foster City, CA). Following RT, samples were analyzed using a microRNA—specific real—time
PCR kit according to manufacturer’s instructions (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA). All
microRNA PCR results were determined using the relative (AACt) quantification method with
the small nuclear U6 RNA run in singleplex as the normalization control, as this is a more
appropriate control for normalization of microRNA levels than an mRNA. Levels of the small
nuclear U6 RNA were not significantly altered by spaceflight (data not shown). For both the

QRT-PCR for the myostatin-associated mRNAs and for the miRs, an independent t-test was
used to evaluate statistical significance, with a < 0.05 taken as significant.
RESULTS
Muscle atrophy induced by unloading. As previously reported (14), body weight was
significantly decreased in the spaceflight mice both when compared to pre—flight (18.3 g
pre—flight vs. 17.4 g post—flight) and compared to AEM (19.4 g for AEM vs. 17.4 g for
spaceflight). Similarly, body mass in suspended mice was also lower post—suspension
compared to pre-suspension (18.2 g pre-suspension vs. 17.8 g post—suspension) and
when compared to unsuspended mice (19.2 g for unsuspended vs. 17.8 g for
suspended). Moreover, gastrocnemius samples from mice flown on STS—108 showed
significant reductions in fiber cross sectional area and a decrease in Citrate synthase
activity, as reported previously (14). Analysis of triceps surae collected from the
hindlimb suspended mice and suspended plus reloaded mice in the present study
confirmed that the ground simulation unloading models also experienced muscle
atrophy: mean weights of the triceps surae taken from the ground-based models were
96.6 +/— 1.1 mg, 85.4 +/— 2.9 mg, and 88.4 +/— 1.3 mg for control, suspended, and
reloaded tissues, respectively, with both suspended and reloaded significantly smaller
than control (p<0.05).
Global microarray analysis. Analysis of DNA microarray data for STS—108
gastrocnemius revealed that 272 mRNAs were differentially expressed in comparison to
11

"
"12","Spaceﬂight effects on mouse skeletal muscle gene expression

AEM controls (fold Change >1.5, p<0.05), with 151 mRNAs upregulated and 121
mRNAs downregulated (Fig. 1A, Table 1). To evaluate how these 272 mRNAs
responded to unloading and reloading stimuli, we performed DNA microarray analysis
on calf muscle prepared from ground-based mouse models subjected to hindlimb
suspension or hindlimb suspension plus brief reloading. Hierarchical clustering of the
expression data for the 272 spaceflight affected mRNAs revealed many similarities in
the responses to spaceflight and hindlimb suspension (Fig. 1A-C). Many of the mRNAs
significantly affected by spaceflight showed similar trends in response to suspension, as
indicated by the heatmap (Fig. 1A), particularly in the area highlighted by the bracket.
Examination of microarray data revealed that most mRNAs up-regulated by spaceflight
showed up—regulation in response to hindlimb suspension (113 of the 151; Fig. 13)
while most mRNAs down-regulated by spaceflight were also down-regulated by
suspension (92 of 121; Fig 1C). Furthermore, it can be seen that reloading
counteracted the effect of hindlimb suspension for many of these mRNAs, such that
mRNAs that were up-regulated by suspension tended to be down-regulated by
reloading and vice-versa; only 22 up-regulated mRNAs and 8 down-regulated mRNAs
did not follow this pattern (Fig. 1B and C).

Further examination of the expression data revealed that 88 of the mRNAs
significantly affected by spaceflight were also significantly affected by one or more of
the ground based stimuli (Table 1, bold). Specifically, 46 of the spaceflight affected
mRNAs were significantly affected by suspension, 42 by reloading, and 37 by the
combination of suspension plus reloading, with overlaps apparent among these groups
(Fig. 1D, Table 1). The majority of these mRNAs (72 of 88) showed a response to

12

"
"13","Spaceﬂight effects on mouse skeletal muscle gene expression
suspension that matched the direction of Change observed in the spaceflight samples.
Furthermore, most of these mRNAs (74 of 88) showed expression patterns that were
consistent with sensitivity to both unloading and reloading stimuli, with reloading
causing a Change in expression that opposed the Change induced by hindlimb
suspension.
Validation of differential expression. Expression Changes observed by microarray
experimentation were confirmed for selected representative genes by QRT—PCR
analysis. Generally, QRT—PCR results Closely matched the microarray findings in terms
of magnitude and direction of Change (Table 2). Specifically, QRT-PCR supported the
effect of spaceflight for all nine mRNAs. Furthermore, all mRNAs that were identified by
microarray analysis as significantly affected by suspension or by reloading also showed
significant Changes by QRT-PCR (Table 2).
Spaceflight and PI3 kinase/Akt/m TOR signaling genes. Spaceflight was associated
with significant shifts in expression of mRNAs involved with the PI3 kinase/Akt/mTOR
pathway. Levels of mRNA of the PI3 kinase regulatory subunit polypeptide 1, pi3kr1/p85
alpha (2.13-fold), the forkhead box 01 (FoxO1) transcription factor (2.31—fold), the
muscIe-specific ubiquitin ligase F—box only protein 32 (MAFbx/atrogin1; 1.61—fold), and
the ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme E2 variant 2 (1 .57—fold) genes were significantly
increased in spaceflight muscle compared to control. Conversely, |RS—1 mRNA levels
were significantly decreased 1.55—fold in spaceflight gastrocnemius.

13

"
"14","Spaceﬂight effects on mouse skeletal muscle gene expression
Spaceflight and expression of myostatin-associated genes. Expression of mRNA
for the myostatin-associated gene, activin lb receptor (Acvr1b; also known as ALK4),
was significantly increased 1.59—fold with spaceflight (Table 1). The myostatin mRNA is
not represented on the 430A GeneChip. However, the primary myostatin receptor
ActRIIb and the myostatin binding/inhibitory protein FSTL3 were both present on the
GeneChip although neither were detected as differentially expressed. Nevertheless,
given the established importance of these three genes in regulating muscle mass, we
examined their mRNA expression using QRT—PCR as an alternate means of analysis.
By QRT-PCR, myostatin mRNA levels tended to increase in the spaceflight samples,
while mRNA levels of FSTL3 tended to decrease in the spaceflight samples, though
neither reached statistical significance (Fig. 2). Conversely, mRNA levels of the
myostatin receptor ActRIIb were significantly decreased in spaceflight gastrocnemius
muscle compared to AEM control (Fig. 2).
Spaceflight and other growth-associated genes. Spaceflight also affected mRNA
levels for other growth regulatory genes. For example, mRNA levels of suppressor of
cytokine signaling 2 (Socs2), p21, and Bth were significantly increased in
gastrocnemius in response to spaceflight (1 .51-, 2.68— and 2.95-fold, respectively).
Other pathways that have been linked to muscle growth and adaptation include the
TNF—oc /NFKB signaling pathway and the calcineurin/NFAT pathway. The TNF—oc
downstream target tumor necrosis factor alpha-induced protein 2 mRNA was
significantly increased in space—flown gastrocnemius (1.68—fold), but the NFKB inhibitor
nuclear factor kappaB light chain gene enhancer in B—cells inhibitor alpha (kabia/IKB
14

"
"15","Spaceﬂight effects on mouse skeletal muscle gene expression
alpha) mRNA was also significantly increased (2.28—fold). Moreover, mRNA levels of the
nuclear factor of activated T-Cells, cytoplasmic, calcineurin-dependent 3 (Nfatc3)
transcription factor were significantly decreased (—1.57-fo|d) in spaceflight
gastrocnemius. Finally, mRNAs for three members of the CMT/enhancer binding
protein (C/EBP) family of transcription factors, C/EBP—alpha (1.72-fold), C/EBP-beta
(1.58—fold) and C/EBP-delta (3.03—fold) were significantly increased in spaceflight
gastrocnemius.
Spaceflight and fiber type genes. The gastrocnemius muscle of the STS—108 mice
examined in this study exhibited a decrease in Citrate synthase activity consistent with a
shift towards a less oxidative phenotype (14). Among the 272 mRNAs differentially
expressed in response to space flight, two encode proteins associated with regulating
oxidative phenotype through activation of oxidative gene expression. Peroxisome
proliferator activated receptor—alpha (PPAR—alpha) and the PPAR gamma coactivator
1a|pha (PGC1-alpha) were both significantly decreased (1 .83—fold and -2.38—fo|d,
respectively).
mRNAs affected by spaceflight, suspension and reloading. As mentioned above,
the majority of mRNAs affected by spaceflight showed a qualitatively similar response to
suspension, and reloading tended to diminish or even reverse the effects of suspension.
This was true for pi3kr1/p85-alpha, p21, Socs2, C/EBP—alpha and -de|ta, and PPAR—
alpha, which were affected by spaceflight and suspension in a matching fashion and for
which reloading counteracted the suspension effect (Table 1). Moreover, 13 other

15

"
"16","Spaceﬂight effects on mouse skeletal muscle gene expression
mRNAs affected by spaceflight were significantly by suspension and by reloading (Fig.
1D). Notably, all 13 of these mRNAs showed counteracting responses to suspension
versus reloading. Furthermore, all except one showed a significant response to
suspension that matched the direction of the significant response to spaceflight, the
exception being Bth, which significantly increased in with both spaceflight and
reloading but significantly decreased with suspension. Among the 13 mRNAs was the
key growth and metabolism regulator |RS—1, which significantly decreased in response
to spaceflight and suspension and significantly increased in response to reloading.
Conversely, Acvr1b/ALK4 mRNA levels were significantly increased by spaceflight and
suspension but significantly decreased in response to reloading (Table 1). Finally,
levels of PGC-1alpha mRNA were significantly decreased by spaceflight and, while not
significantly affected by suspension, were significantly increased by reloading relative to
suspension (Table 1).
MicroRNA affected by spaceflight. As shown in Figure 3, levels of miR—206 relative to
the endogenous control snRNA U6 were significantly decreased by nearly 50% in
gastrocnemius muscle from spaceflight mice compared to AEM controls (Fig. 3C). In
contrast, neither miR-1 nor miR-133a were significantly affected by spaceflight although
both showed a trend towards a decrease, with the decrease in miR—133a nearly
reaching significance (Fig. 3A and B). However, the ratio of miR—1 to miR-133a was
significantly increased in spaceflight gastrocnemius (Fig. 3D).

DISCUSSION

16

"
"17","Spaceﬂight effects on mouse skeletal muscle gene expression

The data previously published for mice from STS—108 showed that murine
skeletal muscle exhibited several adaptations in response to spaceflight. All fiber types
analyzed showed a reduction in cross-sectional area. Moreover, the gastrocnemius
showed a decrease in Citrate synthase activity consistent with a shift towards a less
oxidative phenotype. Here, analysis of mRNA expression by both gene array and QRT-
PCR shows that spaceflight affects mRNA levels of genes involved in numerous cellular
processes including metabolism, cell cycle, apoptosis, and cytoskeletal and
mitochondrial function. Moreover, spaceflight impacts expression of several signal
transduction pathways affecting both muscle growth, including those related to growth
signaling via PI3K/Akt/mTOR, calcineurin/NFAT and myostatin, and those related to
muscle fiber type determination, such as PPAR—alpha and PGC1-alpha.
Spaceflight and genes associated with PI3 kinase/Akt/m TOR signaling. Numerous
studies have now demonstrated that a primary pathway regulating muscle protein
metabolism and therefore muscle growth is the PI3 kinase/Akt/mTOR pathway. This
pathway represents a primary node for regulating both protein synthesis and protein
degradation in response to various stimuli (11, 20, 32). In the present study, we
observed that spaceflight altered mRNA expression of several genes involved in this
pathway: the PI3 kinase regulatory subunit p85 alpha, which negatively regulates PI3
kinase signaling by sequestration of the insulin receptor substrate adaptor-1 (13), was
increased, |RS—1 was decreased, and mRNA levels of the FoxO1 transcription factor
were increased, as were one of its primary targets, MAFbx/atrogini. Together these

17

"
"18","Spaceﬂight effects on mouse skeletal muscle gene expression

data support the hypothesis that spaceflight results in a shift in gene expression which
favors reduced flux through the PI3 kinase/Akt/mTOR pathway.

Spaceflight and myostatin signaling. Both the gene array and QRT—PCR data
suggested that spaceflight is associated with a shift in gene expression favoring
increased myostatin signaling. Levels of myostatin mRNA tended to increase in
spaceflight gastrocnemius (Fig. 2), consistent with previous findings from both
spaceflight and hindlimb suspension muscle (7, 17). Similarly, mRNA levels of the
myostatin binding/inhibiting protein gene FSTL3 also tended to decrease in spaceflight
gastrocnemius. Expression of the myostatin-ActRllb partnering receptor Acvr1 b /ALK4
was significantly increased by both spaceflight and by hindlimb suspension (and
decreased by reloading), though ActRIIb mRNA levels significantly decreased in
spaceflight. With the exception of the decrease in ActRIIb levels, these shifts, if
translated into Changes in the associated proteins, would be consistent with a shift
towards increased myostatin signaling in spaceflight muscle. Consistent with this
interpretation, levels of p21, a cell cycle inhibitor which is a target of myostatin signaling
(42), were significantly up-regulated in response to spaceflight, consistent with a
previous gene array study on spaceflight rat muscle (41 ).

In addition, there is considerable feedback between the PI3
kinase/Akt/mTOR/FOXO pathway and the myostatin pathway. Myostatin activates
protein degradation by inhibiting Akt phosphorylation of the FoxO transcription factors,
resulting in increased expression of ubiquitin ligases (24). Moreover, myostatin
expression is itself positively regulated by the FoxO transcription factors (1). Thus the

18

"
"19","Spaceﬂight effects on mouse skeletal muscle gene expression
changes in mRNA expression associated with reduced Akt activity described above, as
well as the increase in FoxO1 mRNA expression, therefore may also have contributed
to the increase in myostatin transcription observed in this study.
Spaceflight and other growth pathways. Spaceflight significantly affected mRNA
levels of several other genes associated with growth regulation. mRNA encoding Socs2,
a suppressor of cytokine and growth hormone signaling, was increased, as were
mRNAs encoding the cell cycle inhibitors p21 and Bth. These are consistent with a
shift in gene expression favoring reduced cell proliferation, consistent with results from
previous gene array studies on spaceflight and hindlimb suspension (41, 44). In
addition, expression of mRNAs encoding tumor necrosis factor alpha-induced protein 2
and Nfatc3 were altered in ways consistent with shifts in activity of the NF—KB and
calcineurin/NFAT pathways, respectively, that would favor muscle atrophy. Finally, there
were increases in mRNAs encoding three members of the CAAT/enhancer binding
protein (C/EBP) family of transcription factors: C/EBP-alpha, C/EBP-beta, and C/EBP-
delta. Recent evidence has suggested that members of the C/EBP family are regulated
by glucocorticoids, particularly C/EBP-delta (25), and their binding activity is increased
during periods of muscle catabolism (31). Given the present results, the potential role of
these transcription factors in regulating muscle atrophy in response to spaceflight and/or
other modes of unloading needs to be further addressed.
Spaceflight and metabolism. Muscle adaptation to disuse is often Characterized by
fiber type alterations in both contractile and metabolic proteins and protein isoforms,

and previous gene array studies on rat soleus have demonstrated metabolic gene
expression shifts with spaceflight and/or hindlimb suspension (8, 38, 43). In the present
study, expression of both PPAR—alpha and PGCi—alpha mRNA was decreased in
spaceflight gastrocnemius and were significantly increased in suspended plus reloaded
muscle. Dapp et al. (8) also showed a significant decrease in PPAR-alpha expression
with 7 days of hindlimb suspension in the soleus, and expression of both these
transcription factors is increased by endurance exercise (36). In addition, PPAR—alpha
agonists induce a fiber—selective transcriptional response in rats (9), while transgenic
expression of PGC1—alpha in type II fibers has been shown to stimulate Changes in
muscle morphology, gene expression, and transition towards a type | fiber phenotype in
mice (22). Thus the decrease in expression of these two genes may contribute to the
shift towards a less oxidative phenotype observed in response to spaceflight (14).
Spaceflight and microRNA expression. One of the most exciting breakthroughs in
modern biology has been the identification of microRNAs and their role in regulating cell
function. MicroRNAs regulate RNA stability and/or translation in a wide variety of
species and cells, including muscle (reviewed in (6)). More recent data have
demonstrated that several microRNAs are expressed in a muscle type—specific, and/or
differentiation-specific manner (6), and that these microRNAs appear to play critical
roles in muscle gene expression, proliferation, and differentiation (6). Here we found
that expression of miR-206 is significantly decreased in spaceflight gastrocnemius
compared to ground-based control while levels of miR-1 and miR—133a were not
significantly altered (Fig. 3A-C). Interestingly, however, the ratio of miR—1 to miR—133a
20

"
"21","Spaceﬂight effects on mouse skeletal muscle gene expression
was significantly increased with spaceflight (Fig. 3D). The significance of this is that
miR-1 and miR-133a act in opposition to one another with respect to their effect on
skeletal muscle, with miR—1 inhibiting proliferation and miR—133a promoting proliferation
via their effects on HDAC4 and serum response factor, respectively (43). This increase
in the ratio of miR—1 to miR—133a suggests a microRNA expression profile favoring
inhibition of cell proliferation, a finding that is consistent with the shift in expression of
key regulatory genes such as p21 and Soos2 that appears to favor decreased
proliferation as well. To our knowledge this is the first data to examine the levels of
mioroRNAs in muscle in response to spaceflight. To date, only one study has
investigated the in vivo effects of altering muscle activity/Ioad on skeletal muscle
mioroRNA expression (23). Seven days of functional overload (FO) of the plantaris
resulted in a ~50% decrease in miR-1 and miR—133a combined with an ~18—fold
increase in the miR—206 precursor but no Change in mature miR—206 expression (23).

At present, the functional consequences of decreased miR—206 expression with
microgravity exposure are unknown. miR—206 expression is known to be higher in slow,
oxidative muscle than in fast, glycolytic muscle (23), and thus the decrease in
spaceflight muscle might reflect the slow-to—fast shift that characterizes this state.
Furthermore, miR-206 expression is low in proliferating myoblasts and increased during
myoblast differentiation (6), and over-expression of miR—206 promotes cell cycle
withdrawal and differentiation (6), and thus the decrease in miR—206 observed in the
present study may also represent a shift in differentiation capabilities of the satellite
cells and/or muscle fibers. FSTL1 is a target gene negatively regulated by miR—206 (34);
however, in the present study FSTL1 mRNA levels were decreased in response to

21

"
"22","Spaceﬂight effects on mouse skeletal muscle gene expression

spaceflight, which is at odds with the results observed for miR—206 expression. Thus at
present it is unclear what role, if any, miR—206 plays in regulating muscle gene
expression during spaceflight.

Comparison of spaceflight and ground-based unloading models. A majority of the
272 mRNAs affected by spaceflight (171 mRNAs) in the present study showed a similar
trend towards increased or decreased expression with hindlimb suspension (Fig. 13).
Furthermore, 88 of these mRNAs were significantly affected by one or more of the
ground-based stimuli. Generally there was an overriding reciprocal relationship between
the effect of suspension versus the effect of reloading: only 14 of the 88 mRNAs
affected by one or more of the ground based stimuli did not follow this pattern. Although
the sets of mRNAs affected significantly by the ground based stimuli are only partially
overlapping, our results suggest that significance for any of the stimuli appears to act as
a strong indicator of sensitivity to unloading/reloading factors. A previous study of rat
muscle reported (28) that spaceflight resulted in at least an 8-fold Change to 257 total
genes, while hindlimb suspension resulted in at least an 8-fold Change to just 74 genes
(see Table 3 of (28)), percentages fairly similar to those observed in the present study,
suggesting that spaceflight appears to affect more genes than ground-based unloading
in both mice and rats.

Thus the present data suggest that spaceflight elicits qualitatively similar but
quantitatively different effects on muscle mRNA levels compared to hindlimb
suspension. It is also possible that some or all of the mRNAs that were significantly
affected by spaceflight but not by hindlimb suspension were affected by a component of

22

"
"23","Spaceﬂight effects on mouse skeletal muscle gene expression
spaceflight other than the unloading due to microgravity, such as radiation, hypergravity
upon re-entry, etC., which may have potentiated the effects of microgravity-induced
unloading on spaceflight muscle. In addition, as mentioned in the Methods, slightly
different tissue preparations were used; for the spaceflight studies, the medial portion of
the gastrocnemius was used, while in the suspension studies the entire calf was used. It
is therefore possible that at least some of the differences in mRNA expression between
spaceflight and suspension are a consequence of differences in how one portion of the
gastrocnemius responds compared to the combined muscles of the calf. However, while
the three calf muscles differ appreciably in their fiber type composition in normal
animals, we previously demonstrated that all three calf muscles undergo qualitatively
similar shifts in fiber size in response to spaceflight (14). Thus it is unlikely that Changes
in mRNA expression were masked by differential shifts in signaling pathways regulating
fiber size between the different calf muscles. Nevertheless, differences in responses
between spaceflight and suspension may reflect a dilution of the mRNAs affected in the
medial gastrocnemius used in the spaceflight studies by the additional calf musculature
used in the suspension studies.
Spaceflight and reloading. An important consideration for analysis of any spaceflight
data is the reloading period that occurs after landing and before any potential
examination. Here we found that 42 of the 272 mRNAs affected in spaceflight samples
were significantly affected by the reloading stimulus, and most of these showed an
antagonistic response to reloading relative to suspension. This is consistent with a
previous study on acute (12 hour) suspension and 4 hour reloading on rat soleus

23

"24","Spaceﬂight effects on mouse skeletal muscle gene expression

muscle (4), which also showed that reloading tended to counteract the effects of
suspension. In the present study, notable genes whose mRNA was significantly affected
by reloading relative to spaceflight and/or suspension were lRS—1, onr1b/ALK4, and
PGC1—alpha.

As described above, the general effect of reloading was to counteract the effect
of suspension. Among 13 genes independently affected by suspension and by
reloading, only 1 exhibited a significant difference for combined suspension plus
reloading relative to the control state, and only 3 showed a net Change of >1.06—fold
compared to control. Therefore, reloading tended to diminish and thus mask the effect
of suspension. Despite this, mRNA expression Changes in spaceflight samples were
qualitatively most similar to the effects of suspension, suggesting that the predominance
of gene expression Changes occurring in spaceflight samples are likely due to the 12
days of unloading and not the 3.5 hours of reloading. Nevertheless, our finding that 3.5
hours of reloading is sufficient to cause some transcriptional Changes, combined with
the finding that reloading may mask some portion of the unloading response, indicates
that care must be taken in the interpretation of mRNA expression data taken from
reloaded spaceflight samples.

In summary, spaceflight induces changes in expression of mRNAs involved in a
number of cellular processes, and in particular appears to alter the mRNA expression of
many genes involved with regulating muscle growth and fiber type. Surprisingly, few of
these were significantly altered in both spaceflight and hindlimb unloading, which
suggests key differences in how muscles respond on the transcriptional level to these
stimuli. Moreover, reloading is associated with Changes in several mRNAs, some of

24

"25","Spaceﬂight effects on mouse skeletal muscle gene expression
which respond differentially compared to spaceflight and/or hindlimb suspension. At
present it is not Clear to what extent these mRNA Changes are translated into
differences in protein levels for these genes. Future studies will follow up on exploring
the effects of spaceflight and suspension/reloading on protein levels of a selected group
of candidate genes from the present study.
