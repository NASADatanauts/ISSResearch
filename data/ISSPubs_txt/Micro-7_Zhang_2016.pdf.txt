ABSTRACT: Microgravity, or an altered gravity environment different from the 1 g of the Earth, has been shown to
influence global gene expression patterns and protein levels in cultured cells. However, most of the reported studies
that have been conducted in space or by using simulated microgravity on the ground have focused on the growth or
differentiation of these cells. It has not been specifically addressed whether nonproliferating cultured cells will
sense the presence of microgravity in space. In an experiment conducted onboard the International Space Station,
conﬂuent human fibroblast cells were fixed after being cultured in space for 3 and 14 (1, respectively, to investigate
changes in gene and microRNA (miRNA) expression profiles in these cells. Results of the experiment showed that
on d 3, both the flown and ground cells were still proliferating slowly, as measured by the percentage of Ki-67+ cells.
Gene and miRNA expression data indicated activation of NF-KB and other growth-related pathways that involve
hepatocyte growth factor and VEGF as well as the down-regulation of the Let-7 miRNA family. On d 14, when
the cells were mostly nonproliferating, the gene and miRNA expression profile of the flight sample was in-
distinguishable from that of the ground sample. Comparison of gene and miRNA expressions in the d 3 samples,
with respect to d 14, revealed that most of the changes observed on d 3 were related to cell growth for both the flown
and ground cells. Analysis of cytoskeletal changes via immunohistochemistry staining of the cells with antibodies
for a-tubulin and fibronectin showed no difference between the flown and ground samples. Taken together, our
study suggests that in true nondividing human fibroblast cells in culture, microgravity experienced in space has
little effect on gene and miRNA expression profiles.—Zhang, Y., Lu, T., Wong, M., Wang, X., Stodieck, L., Karouia, F.,
