The response of microbes to changes in the mechanical force of ﬂuid shear has important implications for

pathogens, which experience wide ﬂuctuations in ﬂuid shear in Vivo during infection. However, the majority of
studies have not cultured microbes under physiological ﬂuid shear conditions within a range commonly
encountered by microbes during h0st-path0gen interactions. Here we describe a convenient batch culture
bi0system in which (i) the levels of ﬂuid shear force can be varied within physiologically relevant ranges and
quantiﬁed Via mathematical models and (ii) large numbers of cells can be planktonically grown and harvested
to examine the eﬂ‘ect of ﬂuid shear levels on microbial genomic and phenotypic responses. A quantitative model
based on numerical simulations and in situ imaging analysis was developed to calculate the ﬂuid shear
imparted by spherical beads of diﬂ‘erent sizes on bacterial cell cultures grown in a rotating wall vessel (RWV)
bi0react0r. To demonstrate the application of this model, we subjected cultures of the bacterial pathogen
Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium to three physiologically-relevant ﬂuid shear ranges during growth in
the RVW and demonstrated a progressive relationship between the applied ﬂuid shear and the bacterial genetic
and phenotypic responses. By applying this model to diﬂ‘erent cell types, including other bacterial pathogens,
entire classes of genes and proteins involved in cellular interactions may be discovered that have not previously
been identiﬁed during growth under conventional culture conditions, leading to new targets for vaccine and
therapeutic development.

Pathogenic bacteria experience wide ﬂuctuations in ﬂuid subcellular levels. A rigorous combination of numerical mod-
shear levels during the natural course of infection, ranging eling and well-characterized experimental microbial systems

serves as a global regulator of gene expression, stress resis-

teria, including Escherichia coli (8, 9, 17), Bacillus brevis (10),

observed that the addition of a large particle (a 1/8-in. Teﬂon

' Early modeling work by Gao et al. on ﬂuid shear in the
RWV considered the eﬂect of adding a spherical microcarrier

the solid body rotation of the ﬂuid in the bioreactor (13). Gao’s
studies on the ﬂuid dynamics in the RWV were among the ﬁrst

ever, the use of a larger particle in the RWV, like that used by

disrupt the ﬂuid’s solid body rotation. This disruption would
introduce a velocity gradient and increased levels of shear

the early modeling work of Gao et al., we developed a new
quantitative model of the RWV containing a single bead ap-
propriate for the evaluation of ﬂuid shear forces on planktonic
bacterial cells. By using beads of different sizes in the RWV,
the ﬂuid shear imparted to the culture can be adjusted to levels
that the bacteria may experience during the infection process.
