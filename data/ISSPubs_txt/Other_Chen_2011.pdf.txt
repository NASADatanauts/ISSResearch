"2","Summary

The endoplasmic reticulum (ER) has the ability to maintain balance between demand
and synthesis of secretory proteins. To ensure protein-folding homeostasis in the ER,
cells invoke signaling pathways known as the unfolded protein response (UPR). To
initiate UPR, yeasts largely rely on a conserved sensor, |RE1. During the course of
evolution, the suite of UPR arms has harnessed additional transducers. In plants, few
UPR transducers have been identified, but no genetic interaction among them has been
examined to date. The Arabidopsis genome encodes two IRE1 sequence homologues,
AtIRE1A and AtIRE1B. Here we provide evidence that AtIRE1A and AtIRE1B have
overlapping functions essential for the plant UPR. We found that a double mutant of
AtIRE1A and AtIRE1B, atire1a/atire1b, displays reduced ER stress tolerance and
compromised UPR activation phenotype. We have also established that Arabidopsis
AGB1, a subunit of the ubiquitous heterotrimeric GTP-binding protein family, and
AtIRE1A/AtIRE1B independently control two essential plant UPR pathways. By
demonstrating that atire1a/atire1b has a root growth phenotype, which is enhanced by
an agb1 loss-of-function mutation, we attribute a role to UPR transducers in organ
growth regulation.

"
"3","Introduction

Environmental or physiological factors that cause an accumulation of unfolded proteins
in the ER lead to ER stress. To restore ER protein-folding homeostasis, eukaryotic cells
invoke protective signaling pathways known as unfolded protein response (UPR)
(Kozutsumi et al. 1988, Schroder and Kaufman 2005). The regulatory mechanisms of
UPR have been extensively explored in yeasts and metazoans. Inositol-requiring
enzyme 1 (|RE1) is a highly conserved protein in eukaryotes and the major UPR sensor
in yeasts (Cox et al. 1993, Mori et al. 1993). |RE1 is a type | membrane protein, which
consists of a UPR sensor domain at the N-terminus as well as a kinase and an
endoribonuclease domains at the C-terminus. Upon sensing an accumulation of
unfolded proteins in the ER, the endoribonuclease domain of |RE1 is activated through
oligomerization and trans-autophosphorylation. Activated |RE1 splices the transcript of
a specific transcription factor, HAC1 in yeasts (Cox and Walter 1996) and XBP1 in
animals (Shen et al. 2001), in a non-spliceosomal manner. The spliced transcription
factors control the expression of UPR target genes, which are involved in assisting
protein folding, degrading misfolded protein, and regulating programmed cell death
(Acosta-Alvear et al. 2007, Cox and Walter 1996). To manage UPR induced by various
physiological or environmental conditions, animal cells adopt |RE1 and two additional
UPR regulatory pathways: the PKR—Iike ER Kinase (PERK) pathway and the Activating
Transcription Factor 6 (ATF6) dependent pathway (Ron and Walter 2007). Similar to
|RE1, both PERK and ATF6 have an ER lumenal UPR sensor domain and a cytosolic
region that initiates downstream responses. PERK mediates UPR by repressing of
protein synthesis through phosphorylation of eukaryotic initiation factor 2a (Harding et

"
"4","al. 2000). ATF6 is a membrane-tethered transcription factor activated by ER stress. The
transcriptional activation domain of ATF6 is released from the ER membrane through
protease cleavage and translocated into the nucleus to regulate UPR genes upon ER
stress (Haze et al. 1999).

In plants, a few conserved UPR transducers have been identified. In Arabidopsis,
bZIP28 is known as a functional homologue of the mammalian ATF6. To activate UPR,
bzip28 undergo proteolytio release of the transcriptional activation domains to regulate
expression of ER ohaperones (Gao et al. 2008, Liu et al. 2007). The Arabidopsis
genome also encodes two sequence homologues of IRE 1—AtIRE 1A (At2g17520) anol
AtIRE1B (At5924360) (Koizumi et al. 2001)—whioh are ubiquitously expressed in plant
tissues (Noh et al. 2002). AtIRE 1A and AtIRE1B are referred to as AtIRE1 hereafter.
Analyses of three individual T-DNA insertion lines of AtIRE1A show that the induction of
UPR genes was similar between the atire1a mutants and wild type upon ER stress (Lu
and Christopher 2008). Recently, it has been demonstrated that the UPR gene
induction is reduced in a T-DNA insertion line of AtIRE1 B (atire1b-2) (Deng et al. 2011).
In addition, the activation of bZIP60 upon ER stress relies on its splicing by AtIRE1B,
but not by AtIRE1A, suggesting that AtIRE1B is the only functional IRE1 homolog in
plants (Deng et al. 2011). However, it cannot be excluded that AtIRE1A also plays a
role in the plant UPR, as the functional redundancy between AtIRE1A anol AtIRE1 B has
not been test yet.

In addition to the conserved counterparts of mammalian UPR regulators, unexpected
UPR mediators have also been identified in plants. It has been shown that GTP-binding
protein beta 1 (AGB1), an ER localized heterotrimerio GTP-binding protein (G protein),

"
"5","is involved in the UPR in Arabidopsis (Wang et al. 2007). G proteins are ubiquitous
signaling molecules in eukaryotes (Neer and Clapham 1988). In plants, AGB1 is known
to be involved in vegetative and reproductive development as well as in light and
oxidative stress responses (Jones et al. 2003, Joe et al. 2005, Lease et al. 2001, Wei et
al. 2008).

Here, we provide genetic and molecular evidence showing that AtIRE1A and AtIRE1B
are essential plant UPR regulators upon functional characterization of an atire1a/atire1b
double mutant. We also demonstrated that an agb1 loss-of-function mutant enhanced
the atire1a/atire1b phenotype in UPR activation. Thus, we have established that AtIRE1
and AGB1 independently control two essential plant UPR pathways. The negative
genetic interaction between AtIRE1 and AGB1 was further confirmed by the short-root
phenotype of atire1a/atire1b. Hence, this study also sheds light on regulation of organ-
specific growth by UPR transducers in plants.

Resuﬂs

AtIRE 1A and AtIRE1B are Essential for the Plant UPR

To determine whether AtIRE1A and AtIRE1B control the plant UPR, we performed
functional analyses by isolating loss-of-function mutants of AtIRE 1A and AtIRE1B. The
atire1a-4 (WISCDSLOX420D09) and atire1b-2 (SA|L_238_F07) alleles were obtained
from the Arabidopsis Biological Resource Center (ABRC) (Figure 1). Homozygous lines
of atire1a-4 and atire1b-3 were confirmed by genomic polymerase chain reaction (PCR)
(Figure 81). To determine whether atire1a-4 and atire1b-2 represent RNA null a||e|es,
specific AtIRE1A and AtIRE1B primer sets—AtIRE1A-N, AtIRE1A-C, AtIRE1B-N, and

"
"6","AtIRE1B-C, annealing upstream or downstream of the T-DNA insertion sites—were
used in reverse transcription PCR (RT—PCR) analyses (Figure 1b). Using both primer
sets on atire1a-4, we detected no AtIRE 1A transcript, suggesting that atire1a-4 is a
knook-out mutant. In contrast, the AtIRE1B amplicon was present in atire1b-2 using the
upstream primers set (AtIRE1B-N) while there was no detectable AtIRE1B amplicon in
atire1b-2 using the downstream primer set (AtIRE1B-C). The RT—PCR results indicate
that atire1b-2 is not an RNA null, and it does not express the fuII-Iength AtIRE1B
transcript.

To test ER stress tolerance, atire1a-4, atire1b-2, and wild type were germinated on
medium containing DMSO (mock control), 25 ng/ml, or 50 ng/ml tunioamyoin (Tm),
which is a typical UPR inducer that blocks protein N-glycosylation. Since atire1a-4,
atire1b-2, and wild type displayed similar responses in both ER stress tolerance and the
UPR gene induction (Figure 2a and 82), we hypothesized that the two AtIRE1 isoforms
could compensate for each other in the single mutants. To test this possibility, we
generated an atire1a/atire1b double mutant by crossing atire1a-4 anol atire1b-2 (Figure
1b and 81). Indeed, we found that the atire1a/atire1b double mutant displayed a Tm-
oversensitive phenotype compared to wild type and the single mutants (Figure 2a). RT-
PCR analyses showed that after 6-hr Tm treatment, the induction of a known UPR
activation indicator, BiP3 (Iwata anol Koizumi 2005), was drastically reduced in the
atire1a/atire1b double mutant compared to wild type (Figure 2b). Quantitative real time
RT—PCR (qRT—PCR) confirmed that the expression level of BiP3 in the atire1a/atire1b
double mutant was three to four times lower than that of wild type over 3 day time
course of Tm treatment (Figure 2). Consistently, the induction of two other UPR genes,

"
"7","AtERd/BA and AtERd/3B (Yamamoto et al. 2008), was lower in the atire1a/atire1b
double mutant compared to wild type upon ER stress induction (Figure 2d). Thus, we
concluded that the lower ER stress tolerance phenotype in the atire1a/atire1b double
mutant was a result arising from defects in UPR gene induction.

To prove that Tm-sensitive phenotype was due to loss-of-function of AtIRE1A and
AtIRE1B, we complemented the atire1a/atire1b double mutant using the AtIRE 1A clone
under the native promoter (pAt/RE1A-AtIRE1A) as well as Dexamethasone (Dex)-
inducible Clone of either AtIRE1A or AtIRE1B. We found that AtIRE1A or AtIRE1 B alone
could at least partially rescue the ER stress sensitive phenotype of the atire1a/atire1b
double mutant (Figure 83). These data prove that the Tm-sensitive phenotype of the
atire1a/atire1b double mutant is caused by the loss-of-function mutations in AtIRE 1A
and AtIRE1B. Therefore, the IRE1 signaling is essential for the plant UPR, and the
AtIRE1A and AtIRE1B share partially overlapping functions in the plant UPR activation.
Loss-of-Function of A631 Causes Sensitivity to ER Stress

Our data support that AtIRE1 is essential for the plant UPR. We next aimed to get
insight into the plant UPR signaling networks by identification of a regulatory pathway in
parallel with the AtIRE1A/AtIRE1B-depedent signaling arm. Therefore, we first
compared the ER stress tolerance between mutants of known UPR players, including
bZIP28, bZIP60, BiP2 and A631 (Lu and Christopher 2008, Liu et al. 2007, Wang et al.
2005, Wang et al. 2007). Among bzip28-1, bzip60-1, bip2, and agb1-3, only agb1-3
showed a detectable Tm-sensitive phenotype. We found that the agb1-3 mutant was
more sensitive to ER stress compared to wild type (Figure 3a). However, a different T-

"
"8","DNA allele of A681, the agb1-2 mutant, was previously shown to be more resistant to
ER stress (Wang et al. 2007). To clarify whether different agb1 allelic mutants have
similar ER stress sensitivity, we compared the ER stress tolerance between agb1-3 and
two other null allele of A681, agb1-1 and agb1-2 (Figure 1a) (Lease et al. 2001, Wang
et al. 2007), by germinating the seeds on Tm-containing medium. Similar to the agb1-3
mutant, the agb1-1 and agb1-2 mutants displayed ER stress oversensitive phenotype
compared to wild type (Figure 3b). Hence, we conclude that there is no substantial
difference in ER stress tolerance among the agb1-1, agb1-2, and agb1-3 mutants. To
clarify that the opposite ER stress tolerance phenotype of the agb1 mutant reported in
our data and Wang et al. 2007 is not due to different phenotypic assays, the higher ER
stress sensitivity of agb1-3 compared to wild type was further confirmed using the same
ER stress phenotypic assay as conducted in Wang et al. 2007. In detail, agb 1-3 and
wild—type seeds were germinated on high concentrations of Tm (300 ng/ml) for 6 days
and then transferred to normal growth medium without Tm for 10 days. While wiId-type
seeds recovered from the ER stress as evidenced by germination, the agb1-3 seeds
failed to survive under the same treatment (Figure 3c). In addition, complementation of
agb1-3 by AGB1 evidenced that the ER stress phenotype of agb1-3 is due to the A651
loss-of-function (Figure 3d). Therefore, together these data provide evidence that an
AGB1 loss-of—function cause oversensitivity to ER stress.

"
"9","AthE1A/AtIRE1B and AGB1 Independently Control Two Essential Plant UPR
Arms

To our knowledge, the genetic interaction between plant UPR transducers has not been
reported yet. We have shown that both AtIRE1 and AGB1 are essential for the plant
UPR. Hence, we further investigated whether AtIRE1 and AGB1 function in a linear
UPR pathway by generating an atire1a/atire1b/agb1 triple mutant. Interestingly,
compared to the atire1a/atire1b double mutant and the agb1-3 single mutant, the triple
mutant displayed an even more sensitive phenotype to ER stress using two phenotypic
methods: Tm infiltration and germination on Tm containing medium (Figure 4a, b). In the
atire1a/atire1b/agb1 triple mutant, leaf senescence and damage appeared more severe
than in the atire1a/atire1b double mutant at 2-4 day after infiltration with 15 ug/ml Tm
(Figure 4a). When germinated on Tm-containing medium, the atire1a/atire1b/agb1 triple
mutant appeared to be smaller and sicker than the atire1a/atire1b double mutant
(Figure 4b). The enhanced growth defects of the atire1a/atire1b/agb1 triple mutant
compared to that of the atire1a/atire1b double mutant upon ER stress could be further
visualized by induced hypocotyl elongation in dark growth conditions (Figure 4b). We
further investigated whether the lower ER stress tolerance in the atire1a/atire1b/agb1
triple mutant when compared to the atire1a/atire1b double mutant was a result of more
aberrant UPR gene induction. Hence, we compared the expression of UPR genes,
BiP3, AtERd/3A, and AtERd/BB in the agb1-3 single mutant, the atire1a/atire1b double
mutant, and the atire1a/atire1b/agb1 triple mutant over the time course Tm treatment.
The qRT-PCR results showed that the three UPR genes were induced to a lower level
in the atire1a/atire1b double mutant compared to wild type, while the induction was

"
"10","higher in the agb1-3 single mutant compared to wild type (Figure 40, d). These data
suggest that AtIRE1 and AGB1 play an antagonistic role in UPR gene induction.
Furthermore, although the fold changes of UPR gene induction were altered in the
atire1a/atire1b double mutant and the agb1-3 single mutant, the expression patterns of
UPR genes in the atire1a/atire1b double mutant and the agb1-3 single mutant were
similar to those of wild type over the time course of Tm treatment (Figure 4d). In
contrast, in the atire1a/atire1b/agb1 triple mutant, both the expression levels and
patterns of UPR genes were severely affected (Figure 4d). Together with the evidence
that the ER stress tolerance of the atire1a/atire1b/agb1 triple mutant was lower than that
of the atire1a/atire1b double mutant and the agb1-3 single mutant (Figure 4a, b), we
conclude that AtIRE1A/AtIRE1B and AGB1 in parallel mediate two essential plant UPR
signaling arms. Thus, when the two pathways dependent on AtIRE1 or AGB1 are
compromised, plants have a markedly reduced ability to reprogram the transcriptional
machinery to deal with ER stress. In metazoans, regulatory relationships have been
established between components belonged to independent UPR pathways. For
example, although ATF6 and |RE1 are known as two distinct UPR sensors in
metazoans, ATF6 activates the transcription of XBP1, which is the splicing substrate of
|RE1 and a key regulator of the |RE1 dependent signaling arm (Yoshida et al. 2001).
Because the transcription of AGB1 is down-regulated upon UPR activation (Wang et al.
2007), we aimed to investigate whether the AGB1 transcript is regulated by AtIRE 1.
Hence, we compared the AGB1 expression level between wild type and the
atire1a/atire1b double mutant in a time course of Tm treatment. Consistent with earlier
findings (Wang et al. 2007), the RNA level of AGB1 was decreased upon UPR

"
"11","activation in wild type (Figure 4e). In the atire1a/atire1b double mutant, however, the
A631 transcript remained unchanged over the time course of Tm treatment (Figure 4e).
These results imply that down—regulation of the A681 transcript upon ER stress relies
on the AthE1A/AtIRE1B.

AtIRE1A and AtIRE1 B Have a Role in Root Growth

In multicellular organisms, the demand of secretory protein varies during cell
differentiation and proliferation, and UPR is required for maintenance of the ER protein-
folding capability in specialized cell types or at specific developmental stages in
metazoans. For example, deletion of mammalian IRE 1a causes embryo lethality due to
placental defects (Iwawaki et al. 2009). To investigate whether AthE1—mediated UPR is
involved in growth and development in plants, we compared plant morphology between
wild type and the atire1a/atire1b double mutant through developmental stages. We
found that the primary root of the atire1a/atire1b double mutant was significantly shorter
than wild type (T-test, p=3.92449E-18) (Figure 5a, b), yet there was no visible
morphological phenotype in the aerial parts (Figure 50, d). These results indicate that
AtIRE1A and AtIRE1B are specifically involved in optimal root growth in plants. In
addition, consistent with the previous findings (Mudgil et al. 2009, Pandey et al. 2008),
the agb1-3 single mutant showed a longer root phenotype compared to wild type (T-
test, p=0.0064) (Figure 5a, b). However, the primary root of the atire1a/atire1b/agb1
triple mutant was significantly shorter than that of the atire1a/atire1b double mutant (T-
test, p=0.0024) (Figure 5a, b). The observation that the agb1-3 mutation enhanced both
ER stress sensitivity (Figure 4a, b) and root growth defects phenotype of the

"
"12","atire1a/atire1b double mutant hints the possibility that AtIRE1A/AtIRE1B and A631
independently regulate two parallel UPR pathways, and that both these two plant UPR
pathways contribute to root growth.

The root growth phenotype of atire1a/atire1b is associated with defects in cell
elongation

To further explore the short root phenotype, we visualized the root tissue anatomy by
counterstaining cell walls with propidium iodide (PI) (Figure 6a). Four weII-characterized
growth zones are delimited in the Arabidopsis root apex: meristematic zone, transition
zone (TZ), elongation zone (EZ), and growth-terminating zones (GTZ) (Verbelen et al.
2006). The length of each zone in Arabidopsis thaliana ecotype CoI-0 has been
determined based on their unique cellular activities: meristem: 200 am from root cap
junction (RCJ); TZ: 200-520 am from RCJ; EZ: 520-850 am from RCJ; and GT2: 850-
1500 am from RCJ (Verbelen et al. 2006). In addition, the onset of fast elongation in E2
is evidenced by root hair initiation (RHI) in epidermal cells. The results of PI staining
show that the cell number and cell size within 400 um (distance measured from the
RCJ) appeared similar between wild type, the agb1-3 single mutant, the atire1a/atire1b
double mutant, and atire1a/atire1b/agb1 triple mutant (Figures 6a and 84), suggesting
an absence of significant defects in distal root patterning. In sharp contrast, in the region
above 400 pm, the cell length was evidently abnormal in the atire1a/atire1b double
mutant and atire1a/atire1b/agb1 triple mutant. In wild type and the agb1-3 single
mutant, cells were gradually longer from the RCJ toward the GTZ (Figure 6a). However,
the pattern of cell elongation was different in the atire1a/atire1b double mutant and

"
"13","atire1a/atire1b/agb1 triple mutant (Figure 6a). First, cells between 400—600 pm
(distance measured from the RCJ) were significantly longer in the atire1a/atire1b double
mutant and atire1a/atire1b/agb1 triple mutant compared to that of wild type (Figure 6a,
b). Also, in the fast elongation zone, the average cell length of RHI cells was only 50%
in the atire1a/atire1b double mutant and 40% in the atire1a/atire1b/agb1 triple mutant
compared to that of wild type (Figure 6a, 0). These data indicate that the short root
phenotype of the atire1a/atire1b double mutant and the atire1a/atire1b/agb1 triple
mutant is due to a disorder in cell elongation in TZ/EZ rather than to defects in the
meristem. The data further imply that the maintenance of optimal root cell elongation
relies on the AtIRE1A/AtIRE1B— and AGB1—dependent signaling pathways.

The expression of UPR genes is lower in the root of the atire1a/atire1b/agb1 triple
mutant

Our results from PI staining show that the atire1a/atire1b double mutant and the
atire1a/atire1b/agb1 triple mutant displayed defects specifically in root cell elongation
(Figures 5 and 6), a zone characterized by rapid cell wall synthesis (Verbelen et al.
2006). The biosynthesis and assembly of plant cell wall relies on the secretory pathway
(Lerouxel et al. 2006). Hence, it is possible that the AtIRE1A/AtIRE1B— and A681-
dependent UPR pathways may be involved in the control of secretory pathway activities
to achieve optimal root cell elongation. To test this hypothesis, we compared the
transcription level of UPR genes in the root tissue between wild type, the agb1-3
mutant, the atire1a/atire1b double mutant, and the atire1a/atire1b/agb1 triple mutant
using qRT-PCR. Indeed, we found that while there were only two out of 10 test UPR

"
"14","genes showing lower expression in the root of atire1a/atire1b double mutant compared
to wild type, in the atire1a/atire1b/agb1 triple mutant, the transcription of seven test UPR
genes was significantly reduced compared to wild type (Figure 7). These data suggest
that the enhanced short-root phenotype in the atire1a/atire1b/agb1 triple mutant
compared to the atire1a/atire1b double mutant is associated with the lower abundance
of UPR gene transcripts in the root of atire1a/atire1b/agb1 triple mutant.

Discussion

Here we have established that AtIRE1A anol AtIRE1B are critical for the plant UPR by
showing that the |oss-of-funotion of AtIRE 1A and AtIRE1B leads to oversensitivity to ER
stress and alteration of UPR gene induction. By demonstrating that AtIRE1A/AtIRE1B
anol AGB1 independently control the plant UPR, we have also uncovered a genetic
interaction between |RE1 and a G protein-signaling component in UPR. In addition, we
have shown that AtIRE1A/AtIRE1B anol AGB1 contribute to root growth, which is
considered an elegant model system for organogenesis studies. Hence, we have also
associated the UPR transducers with a new biological role in a multioellular context.
AtIRE 1A and AtIRE1B are Critical for the Plant UPR

|RE1 is essential for growth and development in mammals: inactivation of IRE1a, one
of the two mammalian IRE1 isoforms, leads to lethality in mouse due to severe
placental dysfunction (Iwawaki et al. 2009). In yeasts, however, the knockout mutant of
singIe-copy IRE1 is viable (Cox et al. 1993, Shen et al. 2001). Although mutation of
atire1b-2 is not lethal, it is still uncertain that AtIRE1B is dispensable for normal growth

"
"15","and development in plants. First, a homozygous line of a putative AtIRE1B T-DNA
insertion mutant (SALK_O18150, atire1b-1) could not be isolated after selfing of a
heterozygous line (Lu and Christopher 2008). If the embryonic or reproductive lethality
in atire1b-1 is not caused by an AtIRE1B locus-Iinked mutation, then AtIRE1B is an
essential gene. This possibility in turn implies that the atire1b-2 mutant is not a null
allele. This hypothesis is supported by our data showing that the atire1b-2 mutant is not
an RNA null (Figure 1b). In addition, mammalian IRE1a is an essential gene (Iwawaki et
al. 2009) that mediates a diverse biological responses by physical interaction through its
linker and kinase domain (Hetz and Glimcher 2009). Since the T-DNA insertion site of
the atire1b-2 mutant is located at the end of the kinase domain (Figure 85), we propose
that UPR sensor and kinase function may be preserved while the RNase activity is
probably abolished in the atire1b-2 mutant. Hence, the truncated AtIRE1 B protein in the
atire1b-2 mutant might still be able to sense ER folding homeostasis and transduce the
signals through protein-protein interaction or other unknown mechanisms. Namely, the
partial loss-of-function of AtIRE1 B in the atire1b-2 mutant might be sufficient to maintain
the signaling responses required for growth and development. Thus, the leaky atire1b-2
mutant is viable. In contrast, the T-DNA insertion site in the atire1b-1 mutant is located
Close to the transmembrane domain (Figure S4), implying that either the membrane
insertion of AtIRE1B or the kinase and RNase activity are affected severely enough to
result in a complete loss-of-function mutation in the atire1b-1 mutant. As AtIRE1B might
be essential for embryonic or reproductive development, the null allele, atire1b-1, is
|etha|.

"
"16","Although the lethality of atire1b null mutant is undetermined, our data have clearly
proven that UPR activation is compromised in the atire1b/atire1b double mutant (Figure
2), and thus established that both AtIRE 1A and AtIRE1B are critical UPR transducers in
plants.

While this paper is under review, Nagashima et al. reported a similar ER stress
tolerance phenotype of ire1a/ire1b double mutant using another viable T-DNA insertion
line of AtIRE1B (ire1b-3) (Nagashima et al. 2011). The T-DNA insertion in ire1b-3 is at
the N-terminus of transmembrane (Figure 85), suggesting that the transmembrane anol
kinase domain are likely disrupted in ire1b-3. The viable ire1b-3 implies that AtIRE1B
might not be an essential gene. However, whether ire1b-3 is an RNA null is still
uncertain as the transcript analyses of AtIRE1B in ire1b-3 has only been examined by
the primer set cross the T-DNA insertion. Complementation test of atire1b-1 with
AtIRE1 B will clarify that whether AtIRE1B is an essential gene in plants.

ls bZIP60 the only AtIRE1 substrate in UPR signaling?

It has been recently demonstrated that upon ER stress the activation of bZIP60 relies
on mRNA splicing by AtIRE1B, but not by AtIRE1A (Deng et al. 2011). Unlike the
atire1a/atire1b double mutant, neither the atire1b-2 nor bzip60-1 mutant showed
reduced ER stress tolerance phenotype compared to wild type (Figure 2a, 3a). This
indicates that AtIRE1A is sufficient to compensate the absence of AtIRE1B—bZIP6O
regulation on the plant UPR. Hence, the splicing of bZIP6O might not be the only
regulatory mechanism in AtIRE1 dependent UPR pathway. Furthermore, since there
were no detectable phenotypic changes in ER stress tolerance in the bzip60-1 mutant

"
"17","(Figure 3a), we propose that the ER stress sensitive phenotype of the atire1a/atire1b
double mutant is not simply caused by the defects of bZIP6O splicing. Instead, there
might exist other target(s) that may be recognized and activated by either AthE1A
alone or by both AthE1A anol AthE1B. In animals and yeasts, only one splicing
substrate of |RE1 has been identified and confirmed as a UPR regulator. Multiple
splicing targets of |RE1 may allow plants to respond to a variety of stimuli that they may
encounter as sessile organisms. Also, we cannot exclude the possibility that AthE1
might regulate the plant UPR through protein-protein interaction or some unidentified
regulatory mechanisms.

Again, while this paper is under review, Nagashima et al. reported that the defect of
bZIP6O splicing was only detected in atire1a/atire1b double mutant, but not the single
mutant of atire1a or atire1b. Although there is discrepancy of bZIP6O splicing in single
mutants of AtIRE1B (Deng et al. 2011, Nagashima et al. 2011 ), the fact that bzip60-1
did not show ER stress sensitive phenotype comparable to atire1a/atire1b double
mutant supports the hypothesis that AthE1 control the plant UPR not only through the
splicing of bZIP60.

AGB1 has a Positive Role in Cell Survival upon ER Stress

Unlike IRE1, a well-oharaoterized UPR sensor in yeasts and metazoans, the molecular
mechanisms of A631 regulation on UPR are yet unclear. Especially, it is unknown that
whether AGB1 controls UPR through a classical G protein signaling function, such as
maintaining ion homeostasis (Hamm 1998). Sustained ER stress may lead to the
apoptotio pathway. Given that the induction of UPR genes is higher in the agb1-3

"
"18","mutant compared to that of wild type (Figure 40, d) we propose that AGB1 monitors the
induction level of UPR genes to ensure the UPR is not over-activated, which might lead
to cell apoptotic pathway. G protein components are involved in certain fundamental
cellular function including ion homeostasis and cell proliferation in both plants and
animals (Jones and Assmann 2004). However, to our knowledge, the G protein
signaling pathways have not been reported to regulate the UPR in metazoans. It is
possible that in plants AGB1 has evolved unique functions in mediating the plant UPR,
yet we cannot exclude the possibility that the G protein signaling pathways are also
involved in the metazoan UPR. Uncovering roles of G protein signaling in the metazoan
UPR might be Challenging due to the functional redundancy linked to the presence of
multiple copies of G protein components in metazoans.

Antagonistic Regulation of AtIRE1A/AtIRE1B and AGB1 on the Plant UPR

Studies of genetic interactions between UPR regulators in C.elegans have uncovered
complex functional relationship of UPR regulators (Shen et al. 2005). Establishing that
there are two parallel signaling pathways mediated by AtIRE1A/AtIRE1B or AGB1
supports the hypothesis that multiplicity of UPR arms is advantageous for cells in
response to diverse stimuli in multicellular organisms. ER protein-folding homeostasis is
known to be exquisitely dynamic and to require timely and fine—tuned regulation
(Kaufman 1999). The evidence that induction of UPR genes is lower in the
atire1a/atire1b double mutant but higher in the agb1-3 single mutant compared to that of
wild type suggests that AtIRE1A/AtIRE1B and AGB1 act antagonistically to maintain
proper UPR (Figure 40, d). The hypothesis is further supported by that the down-

"
"19","regulation of A631 transcript upon ER stress as seen in wild type is disrupted in the
atire1a/atire1b double mutant.

The Regulation of AtIRE1A/AtIRE1B and A631 on Root Growth

UPR is proven to be essential for growth and development in mammals. Although we
cannot exclude the possibility that AtIRE 1A and AtIRE1B regulate root growth via a
mechanism unrelated to UPR, the most likely scenario is that the AtIRE1A/AtIRE1B—
and AGB1—dependent UPR pathways coordinately contribute to primary root growth.
Evidence supporting this hypothesis is that the atire1a/atire1b/agb1 triple mutant
displayed enhanced phenotypes compared to the atire1a/atire1b double mutant in both
ER stress sensitivity and root growth defects. Secondly, the lower transcription level of
UPR genes in the root of the atire1a/atire1b/agb1 triple mutant suggests that the shorter
root length is due to compromised secretory capacity (Figure 7). Identification and
Characterization of differentially expressed genes in root tissue between wild type and
the atire1a/atire1b/agb1 triple mutant will further help determine whether UPR contribute
to root growth and possibly define novel regulatory pathways in root growth and
development.

Experimental Procedures

Plant Materials and Growth Conditions

Arabidopsis thaliana ecotype Columbia (CoI-O) was used as the wild-type control.
Arabidopsis transfer-DNA insertion (T—DNA) mutants, atire1a-4 (WISCDSLOX420D09),
atire1b-2 (SA|L_238_FO7), agb1-3 (SALK_O61896), agb1-2 (086535), bzip28—1

"
"20","(SALK_132285), bzip60-1 (SALK_050203), bip2 (SALK_047956) and the mutant with
point mutation agb1-1 (083976) were obtained from the Arabidopsis Biological
Resource Center (Ohio State University, Columbus OH (Lu and Christopher 2008, Liu
et al. 2007, Wang et al. 2005, Wang et al. 2007). The primers used for genotyping are
listed in the Table S1. Surface-sterilized seeds were plated directly onto square Petri
dishes containing 1/2 Linsmaier and Skoog's (LS) medium, 1.5% (w/v) sucrose, and
0.4% Phytagel. For the normal growth condition, plants were grown at 21°C under 16-h-
|ight/8-h-dark conditions.

Tm Treatment

In a plate system, the Tm (Sigma, T7765; dissolved in DMSO) was directly added in the
1/2 LS medium containing 1.5% (w/v) sucrose and 0.4% Phytagel, at the concentrations
indicated in the text. Seeds were directly germinated in Tm-containing medium for
observation of ER stress tolerance. To harvest tissue for UPR gene expression
analysis, the seeds were germinated in 1/2 LS medium without Tm for 2 weeks, and then
transferred to Tm-containing medium. In a hydroponic system (Araponics), seedlings
were grown in liquid medium (FIoraSeries by GHE) without Tm for 4 weeks; then 10
mg/ml Tm dissolved in DMSO was added in the liquid medium. For the infiltration
method, needleless syringe was used to infiltrate 15 ug/ml Tm into the abaxial side of
leaves. As mock control of the Tm treatment, a volume of DMSO equivalent to that of
used to dissolve Tm in each method was used in the same experimental procedure.

"
"21","Genotyping and Isolation of Multiple T-DNA Insertion Mutants

Genotyping of the T-DNA insertion mutants was accomplished by genomic DNA
extraction followed by DNA amplification with T-DNA and gene-specific primers. The
primers used for genotyping and phenotyping are listed in the Table 81. PCR
experiments were performed in standard conditions and were carried out using 0.2 mM
dNTPs, 0.2 pM primer, and 1 unit of Taq polymerase (Promega). Homozygous lines for
T-DNA insertion of transgenic plants were isolated through segregation analyses on
media containing the selective marker encoded in the T-DNA. Isolation of multi-allelic
lines was performed through reciprocal crosses followed by genotyping of the F2
generation.

RNA Extraction and Quantitative RT—PCR (qRT—PCR) Analysis

Total RNA was extracted from whole seedlings using the RNeasy Plant Mini Kit
(Qiagen) and treated with DNaseI (Qiagen). All samples within an experiment were
reverse transcribed at the same time using High Capacity RNA—to-CDNA Master Mix Kit
(ABI 4390777). A “No—RT” reaction, in which RNA was subjected to the same
conditions of CDNA synthesis except without reverse transcriptase, was included as a
negative control in all qRT—PCR assays to ensure the purity of RNA samples. ReaI-time
qRT-PCR with SYBR green detection was performed in triplicate using the Applied
Biosystems 7500 Fast Real-Time PCR System. Data were analyzed by the DDCT
method. Transcript level was normalized to ISOPENTENYL PYROPHOSPHA TE (IPP2)
for each sample. For AtERdjSA, AtERd/3B, and A681, the relative transcript level is
expressed as the fold change (mean i SEM) in each genotype under Tm treatment

"
"22","relative to the mock control (set to a value of 1). For BiP3, as the transcript level is
extremely low in the mock control, the relative transcript level is expressed as the fold
Change (mean i SEM) in atire1a/atire1b under each time point of Tm treatment relative
to the wild type under the same treatment condition (set to a value of 1). For all the
UPR—response genes examined in the root or shoot tissue, the relative transcript level is
expressed as the fold change (mean i SEM) in each genotype relative to the wild type
under the normal growth condition (set to a value of 1). We performed three
independent experiments in triplicates. Values are presented in the figures are averages
of three samples from one representative experiment. A similar pattern was observed
from three independent biological replicates.

Phenotypical Analyses

Root length measurements were averaged from 30 plants for each genotype; aerial
tissue from 10 plants was pooled to estimate the fresh weight. Values were averaged
from 3 individual samples for each genotype. Cell length calculations were performed
on 10 roots for each genotype. Statistical analyses included the Student’s two—tailed t-
test, assuming equal variance; data with p<0.05 were considered significant.
Arabidopsis Stable Transformation and Complementation

For cloning in the Dex—inducible vector (pTA7002), standard molecular cloning
techniques were used. Complementation of agb1-3 was achieved by a 358-AGB1-YFP
fusion. pAtIRE1A—AtIRE1A and 358-YFP-AGB1 were generated using binary vectors
pGWB1 and pEarIygate104, respectively (Earley et al. 2006, Nakagawa et al. 2007).

"
"23","The genomic or coding regions of genes were amplified with the Gateway-compatible
primers from the CDNA synthesized from total RNA of wiId—type (CoI-O) seedlings using
Phusion High—Fidelity DNA polymerase (New England Biolabs). The PCR fragments
were cloned to the donor vector (pDonorTM207) and destination vectors pGWB1 and
pEarIygate104. Primer sequences used in this work are listed in Table S1. Arabidopsis
plants were transformed by the floral dip method (Clough and Bent 1998) and
transformants were selected on 1/2 LS media supplemented with hygromycin (final
concentration, 20 ug/ml) and 0.8% (w/v) agar. Induction of Dex—inducible Clone was
achieved with DEX (30 pM; Sigma).

Confocal Laser Scanning Microscopy

An inverted laser scanning confocal microscope (LSM51O META, Carl Zeiss) was used
for imaging analyses. Imaging of propidium iodide-Iabeled roots (10 pg/ml) was carried
out using a 543-nm excitation of a He/Ne laser and a LP 560 emission filter. Post-
acquisition analyses were performed with Zeiss AIM software. Adobe Illustrator was
used for further image handling.
