Abstract In this study we investigated the security of a spaceﬂight experiment from two
points of View: spreading of dried fungal spores placed on the different wafers and their
Viability during short and long term missions 0n the International Space Station (188).
Microscopic characteristics of spores from dried spores samples were investigated, as well
as the morphology of the colonies obtained from spores that survived during mission. The
selected fungal species were: Aspergillus niger, Cladosporium herbarum, Ulocladium
chartamm, and Basipetospora halophila. They have been chosen mainly based on their
involvement in the biodeterioration of different substrate in the 188 as well as their presence
as possible contaminants 0f the 188. From biological point of View, three of the selected
species are black fungi, with high melanin content and therefore highly resistant to space
radiation. The Visual inspection and analysis of the images taken before and after the short and
the long term experiments have shown that all biocontainers were returned to Earth without
damages. Microscope images of the lids 0f the culture plates revealed that the spores of all
species were actually not detached from the surface of the wafers and did not contaminate the
lids. From the adhesion point of View all types of wafers can be used in space experiments,
with a special comment on the Viability in the particular case of iron wafers when used for
spores that belong to B. halophila (halophilic strain). This is encouraging in performing
experiments with fungi without risking contamination. The spore Viability was lower in the
experiment for long time to 188 conditions than that of the short experiment. From the
observations, it is suggested that the environment of the enclosed biocontainer, as well as the
species’speciﬁc behaviour have an important effect, reducing the Viability in time. Even the

spores were not detached from the surface of the wafers, it was observed that spores used in the
long term experiment lost the outer layer of their coat without affecting the Viability since they
were still protected by the middle and the inner layer of the coating. This research highlights a
new protocol to perform spaceﬂight experiments inside the 188 with fungal spores in micro-
gravity conditions, under the additional effect of possible cosmic radiation. According to this
protocol the results are expressed in terms of Viability, microscopic and morphological changes.

Introduction
Microorganisms sense their environment through a variety of sensors and receptors that serve
to integrate the different signals into the appropriate cellular response that is optimal for
survival purposes. In the space environment, factors such as microgravity, temperature, and
solar UV or cosmic radiation vary signiﬁcantly, especially at different altitudes and under the
inﬂuence of the Earth’s magnetic ﬁeld. This might impose a signiﬁcant effect on the physi-
ology and pathogenesis of microorganisms or induce mutations (Nickerson et al. 2004;
Horneck et al. 2010; Gomoiu et al. 2013; Wang et al. 2014). Fungi and bacteria are
microorganisms that can cause severe health problems to astronauts and contamination to
spacecraft. The activation of opportunistic pathogens has been already observed in the closed
environments of spacecraft used in long-duration missions, increasing the risk of infectious
diseases (Ilyin 2005). Gram-positive and Gram—negative bacteria, as well as fungi, were found
on the surfaces inside the spacecraft, in water reservoirs aboard the 188 (La Duo et al. 2004),
and in the KIBO module of ISS (Satoh et al. 2011). Spores of Aspergillus niger, Cladosporium
herbarum, and Ulocladium botrj/tis have already been identiﬁed on different surfaces (mostly
of equipment), and in air samples from the orbital station Mir (Novikova et al. 2006).

On board experiments have been also performed with microorganisms belonging to
different bacteria (Wang et al. 2014) and with ascomycetes (Horneck et al. 2010), one
experiment with the ﬁlamentous fungus Ulocladium chartarum (Gomoiu et al. 2013), while
other experiments were performed in simulated microgravity conditions with cyanobacteria,
green algae, with Bacillus subtilis, Staphylococcus aureus, two species of archaea. Flight-
grown roots of soybean infected with Phytophtora sojae have shown more disease symptoms,
and root tissues were more extensively colonized in space relative to the ground controls Ryba—
White et al. 2001).

The case of inactivation or lethality of bacteria, archea, fungi and lichens has also been
tested. The ﬁrst lethality experiments with fungal spores were based on samples of Penicillium
mquefom’ during Gemini IX and X11 missions. Lethality was found to be similarly high with
conidia of the fungus Aspergillus ochraceus, with bacterial cells of Deinococcus radiodurans,
and with spores of Bacillus subtilis (Horneck et al. 2010). Less affected were the halophilic
archea species Halorubrum chaoviatoris when they were embedded in salt crystals
(Mancinelli et al. 1998). Lichens species, such as Rhizocarpon geographicum and Xanthoria
elegans, as well as Antarctic black fungi and cryptoendolithic communities, seem to cope very
well with the real space environment (Brandt et al. 2015; Onofri et al. 2012).

The hypothesis of Panspermia postulates the propagation of microscopic forms of life
among planets by solar radiation pressure (Horneck et al. 2012). Since 1903, new discoveries

have been reported, such as that of Martian meteorites that have provided evidence for the
transfer of rock fragments from Mars to Earth in the solid state, at moderate shock pressures
and temperatures (Horneck et a1. 2008), in which microbial communities possibly could have
been found inhabiting niche environments in subsurface rocks (Chatzitheodoridis et a1. 2014;
Marschall et a1. 2012; Boston et a1. 1992). Space exposure experiments have also demonstrated
a high survivability capacity of bacterial spores in space, mostly when they are protected
against solar radiation (Horneck et a1. 1994; Stofﬂer et a1. 2007). The increased spore y-
radiation resistance is correlated with the low level of spore core water which may reduce the
amount of hydroxyl radicals formed (Nicholson et a1. 2000).

Several techniques exist to test the Viability of microorganisms (Kell et a1. 1998; Breeuwer
and Abee 2000; Gracias and McKillip 2004; de Vera et a1. 2014). However, not all are reliable
as the traditional methods. For example, ﬂuorescein diacetate (FDA) is a rapid method to
assess Viability, which was applied on fungal spores of Aspergillus niger, Rhizopus stolonifer,
Penicillium citrinum, and F usarium oxyspomm. The addition of NaCl or MgClZ to the staining
solution increased the ﬂuorescence intensity of A. niger spores but nonViable spores were
distinguished (Yang et a1. 1995). Additionally, culture-independent methods based on a
combination of ﬂuorescent dyes, such as LIVE/DEAD Viability assay kits, are used to quantify
viable cells (Olsson—Francis and Cockell 2010). Traditional methods include the direct colony
count methods, which are still considered as the most robust to measure survivability in pure
cultures (Horneck et a1. 2008), and which were successfully applied on dry spore samples.

In this study we investigated the security of a spaceﬂight experiment from spreading of
dried fungal spores placed on the different wafers and the Viability of fungal spores during
missions of short and long exposure periods on the International Space Station. This was
performed using traditional methods, i.e., by investigating the microscopic characteristics of
spores and, subsequently, the morphology of the colonies of these spores after the mission. The
selected fungal species: Aspergillus niger, Cladosporium herbamm, Ulocladium chartamm,
and Basipetospora halophila, were sent as dried spores samples to short and long spaceﬂight
missions to the International Space Station. They have been chosen mainly based on their
involvement in the biodeterioration of organic and inorganic substrates, covered with organic
deposits from 188 (Gomoiu et a1. 2013). Fungi of these species are expected to be possible
contaminants of the 188. Three of the selected species are black fungi, constituting an
additional reason to choose them due to their high melanin content, and therefore high
resistance to space radiation (Onofri et a1. 2008).

Material and Methods
Biological Material
The biological material that was used for the spaceﬂight mission consisted of the four fungal
strains Aspergillus niger CM—l, Basipetospora halophila CM—l, Cladosporium herbarum CM-
1, and Ulocladium chartamm CM—1, which are deposited in the Microbial Culture Collection
of the Institute of Biology, Bucharest, Romania, and are available to the scientiﬁc community.
Aspergillus niger CM—l was isolated from a contaminated phonograph cylinder. Basipetospora
halophila CM—lwas isolated from litter in Grota Miresei Lake, Romania. Cladosporium
herbarum CM—l and Ulocladium chartamm CM—1 were isolated from Romanian mural
paintings, mainly from areas where vegetal residues were present on the intonaco layer (the

support of pictorial layer). The identification of ﬁingal species has been made according to
their macroscopic colonial characteristics, but also by their microscopic hyphal features
(McLaughlin et al. 2001). Three species were cultivated for 7—10 days in the laboratory on
YGC substrate medium containing 5 mg/ml yeast extract, 20 mg/ml glucose, 0.1 mg/ml
chloramphenicol, and 20 mg/ml agar. Then, the spores were harvested. Basipetospora
halophila needs about 50 days of incubation because is a halophilic species.

Spaceﬂight Experiment Setup
Samples of dried spores were prepared, attached on silicon, polycarbonate, and iron wafer
substrates by dropping spore suspensions, and left them dry. Each wafer contained 106—108
spores/10 rnmz. After drying, the wafer substrates with the samples were placed in small, double-
celled culture plates of 30 mm diameter that were hermetically closed with Teﬂon gaskets.
Living cultures where prepared only in larger culture plates, of 60 mm diameter. All culture
plates were placed in biocontainers, which are large plastic boxes with compartments on either
side, both hermetically sealed with rubber gaskets and a large number of screws (Fig. la, 0).
For the short spaceﬂight experiment, culture plates with living cultures of U. chartamm
(Gomoiu et al. 2013) and with dried spores of A. niger, B. halophila, C. herbamm, and
U. chartarum were sealed and assembled into three polycarbonate biocontainers (BC#l—
BC#3, Pedeo Techniek, Belgium). In the initial experiment, each biocontainer contained: a)
four large, 60 mm circular culture plates, two on either side of each biocontainer (Fig. la) with
living cultures; b) eight small, 30 mm circular culture plates, four on either side of each
biocontainer, with dried spores (Fig. la) on the different substrates (silicon, iron, polycarbonate).

For the long spaceﬂight experiment, twenty four small (30 mm) culture plates were placed
and sealed in biocontainer BC#4, twelve in either side (Fig.1c), containing all four species
suspended on the three different substrates.

All four biocontainers were equipped with a programmable, miniature—sized temperature
logger (Smart Button, from ACR Systems Inc.), as well as passive radiation loggers (SCK
CEN), to monitor the ionizing radiation exposure over the duration of the space mission. For
protection during up— and download, every biocontainer was placed in a pouch of protective
foam and 0f NOMEX fabric (Fig. lb, (1). All biocontainers were stowed in a stowage
compartment in the Columbus module of ISS and kept there until return. Pictures were taken
by the crew on ﬂight days 5 and 9 only for biocontainers BC# l—BC#3. All biocontainers
remained sealed during the experiment and were returned to Earth after 14 days for the short
spaceﬂight experiment, and after 5 months for the long spaceﬂight experiment. Ground control
biocontainers were prepared respecting exactly the same procedure and keeping the same
conditions with those of the spaceﬂight, and were placed in the laboratory.

During the short spaceﬂight to 188 with Shuttle STS—l33, as well as onboard ISS, BC#1—
BC#3 were exposed to temperatures of 21.5 i 2 oC. Respectively, the BC#4 which performed
the long spaceﬂight to 188 (returned later with Shuttle STS—l35), as well as its on board stay,
was exposed to temperatures of 21.8 i 3 oC. The total absorbed dose of ionizing radiation
recorded during the ﬂight was about 150 HGy per day for each of the samples (background
corrected).

Biocontainer Contamination Investigation
The possible spreading of the spores, and therefore the contamination of the culture plates and
the biocontainer lids during the duration of the experiment, was investigated by light micros-
copy. A trinocular Leica DMLM microscope with maximum magniﬁcation of X1000 was
used, inspecting the lids 0f the microcapsules where the small culture plates were placed. This
was performed for the space experiment and the ground control. In parallel, the lids were
sampled for possible contamination by washing; the samples were then inoculated 0n YGC
medium, and incubated at 26 oC.
Conidial Viability Investigation
The rate of spore germination was used as a measure of Viability. A spore was considered to be
Viable if the length of its germ tube was twice the diameter of the propagule or, if conspicuous
swelling of the spore was Visible (Herlinda 2010). Viability of the spores was assessed by
washing 10 times each wafer, followed by inoculation of decimal dilutions onto 60 mm culture
plates with YGC substrate medium. Spores of B. halophila have been inoculated onto the
medium prepared both with distilled and with Baia Baciului water, because the strain was
isolated from the Romanian salt lake. After 10 days of incubation, fungi have been counted in
Colony Forming Units (CFUs). In case of Basipetospora halophila the incubation time was
prolonged to 50 days.

aluminium stubs and sputter—coated with gold or platinum to avoid charging during investi-
gation under the scanning electron microscope (SEM). Two SEM instruments were used in
this study. The ﬁrst was a Jeol 6380LV, which was operated in high vacuum, at a working
distance of 10 mm, and an acceleration voltage of 20, 25, or 30 kV—depending on resolution
requirements at the different magniﬁcations. The second instrument was a LEO 1530 Gemini
FE-SEM, operated at a working distance of 7 mm and an accelerating voltage of 5 orlO kV.
Secondary electron images (SE) of spores were captured with both instruments.
Morphology of Colonies
In order to analyze the morphology of the colonies obtained after the short and the long
spaceﬂight experiments, mainly their growth and the possible development of microcolonies
as has been found in experiment with living cultures of U. chartamm (Gomoiu et al. 2013),
spores of different variants were inoculated on YGC substrate medium in large culture plates
(60 mm), sealed and assembled into polycarbonate biocontainers to have the same experimen-
tal conditions and to obtain more information about the growth of fungi in biocontainers used
for space missions. The growth of the colonies was evaluated using images taken during the
experiment in different instances between the 5thand the18th day, using similar procedures as
for the U. chartamm colonies of the short time experiment (Gomoiu et al. 2013).

Results

Inspection of the Biocontainer and Capsule Lids after the Flight Missions

The Visual inspection and analysis of the images taken before and after the short and the long
term experiments has shown that all biocontainers were returned to Earth without damages.
Unpacking has also shown that all microcapsules were at their original positions, on sides A
and B. Temperature and radiation sensors were also at their original position and in a good
shape. During transportation, the registered temperature proﬁles have shown that colonies
remained in the required temperature range of 2 1—22 oC. The only worth noting observation is
that after the long mission all iron wafers were oxidized. A high degree of oxidation occurred
on the iron wafers that were covered with the spores of the moderately halophilic B. halophila.
This was most probably due to chemical reactions between the iron ions and the salts of the
nutrient used for the growth of the colonies obtained in the laboratory for preparation of the
dried spores’ samples.

Microscope images of the lids of the capsules revealed that the spores of all species were
actually not detached from the surface of the wafers and did not contaminate the lids. Also the
inoculation of the samples on the YGC medium did not develop any colony, meaning that no
spores were detached from the surface of the wafers to contaminate the microcapsules.
Similarly, microscopic inspection of the lids of the biocontainers themselves resulted to the
same conclusion.

Viability of Spores after the Short Spaceﬂight Mission

After the short spaceﬂight mission, all dried spores from all types of substrate produced
cultures that indicated high Viability (Fig. 2a). The highest Viability was measured on the

polycarbonate (plastic) wafers (95.5—96.5 % for ground controls and 95.7—96.7 % for space-
ﬂight), followed by the silicon wafer (93.2—96.3 % for ground controls and 93.4—96.2 % for
spaceﬂight). Iron wafers have shown slightly lower values, both for the ground controls and
for the spaceﬂight, 90.7—94.4 % and 90.6—94.3 % respectively.

Speciﬁcally the dried spores ofB. halophila seem to be more sensitive than the spores from
the sporulated colonies that are cultivated in laboratory conditions, for samples of the same
period of time. The Viability of dried spores for all fungal strains investigated here is similar to
the Viability of living colonies, irrespective of the substrate.

Viability of Spores after the Long Spaceﬂight Mission
The Viability of the long spaceﬂight mission showed different results between strains (Fig.2b).
A. niger spores showed a high Viability, even after 5 months on board the 188 (91 .5—95 %), as

well as their laboratory controls on Earth (92—953 %; Fig. 2b). The highest value was
observed from strains that are taken from the plastic substrate, and the lowest from the iron
substrate. Moreover, Viability values were only slightly lower than those found after the short
time stay on board the 188. The high oxidation of the iron wafers did not affect the Viability of
the spores ofA. niger signiﬁcantly because this strain is well-known for its high resistivity to
heavy metals. Similar behavior but with slightly lower Viability values was shown by
U. chartamm. B. halophila showed higher Viability values than C. herbarum, however, still
lower that A. niger and U. chartamm. Both were not Viable after retrieval from the iron wafers.
Microscopic Characterization of Spores after the Short Spaceﬂight Mission
After the short spaceﬂight mission, ground (Fig. 3a) and ﬂight (Fig. 3b) dried spore samples of
A. niger look similar. They have a round shape with thick, rufﬂed surface coats, and a
connection structure to the next spore that keeps them in a chain.

Dried spore samples of C. herbamm contain secondary ramoconidia with up to four distal
hila, and they had ellipsoidal t0 cylindrical-oblong shapes, with intercalary conidia of up to
three distal hila. The terminal conidia were small and ellipsoidal without distal hilum (Fig. 3d).

They were covered by ornamentation, showing irregularly reticulate structures. Spores looked
also similar to those of the ground control after the short mission (Fig. 30).

U. chartarum spores are multi-celled due to their transverse and longitudinal septation,
have an 0b0V0id (narrowest at the base) rough-walled shape, and most of them become
verrucose. U. chartamm spores appeared with uniform, knobby surfaces, and with a bud at
one end. We did not ﬁnd any changes either in ﬂight (Fig. 3f) or in the ground (Fig. 3e)
samples after the short mission. This species was able to germinate when condensation takes
place, either during the photo sessions or the transportation. We estimate that condensation
during the short mission was lower than during the long mission.

Microscopic characterization of spores after short space mission revealed that they look
similar with dried spores samples of the mentioned species in the laboratory conditions,
possibly due to short time mission and experimental conditions (inside the ISS).
Microscopic Characterization of Spores after the Long Time Mission
SEM images of A. niger spores revealed that spores are covered by an outer layer, which
appears as ornaments, both on the ground (Fig. 4a) and the ﬂight experiment (Fig. 4b). On

different shapes, such as ﬁlamentous, round, and irregular (unpublished results). Although a
partial detachment or loss of the outer layer of the spores was observed, still, their Viability was
not affected.

SEM examination of C. herbamm of both the long ﬂight mission and the respective ground
control showed that the secondary ramoconidia, as well as the conidia, contained micro-cracks,
and breaking or partial detachment of reticulate surface ornamentation. These were more
evident in the samples of the ﬂight experiment (Fig. 4d) rather than those of the ground
experiment (Fig. 4c), possibly an important reason for their loss of Viability.

Some spores of U. chartarum seemed to lose their knobble surface during the
germination process, confirming the ongoing morphological change (Fig. 4e, i);
however, this did not affect their Viability. Germination has been also put in evidence
as a consequence of condensation.

Morphology of Colonies
The aerial mycelium showed similar characteristics for all spore variants that were isolated
from the short and the long trip experiments on 188, and small differences in comparison to
their laboratory controls. The observed differences in the morphology of the colonies show
mostly irregular margins, submerged mycelium extending at lengths outside the margin of the
colony, and smaller diameters of the hyphae (Table 1). These observations suggest that the
growth conditions (large culture plates, sealed and assembled into polycarbonate
biocontainers) have an inﬂuence on the morphology of the colonies. Similar results have been
obtained in the experiment with living cultures of U. chartarum (Gomoiu et al. 2013).

Discussion

Spreading 0f Fungal Spores during Space Experiments

The biological material was represented by four filamentous fungi species A. niger,
B. halophila, C. herbarum, and U. chartarum. The reasons for choosing those species were
their high melanin content in the cell coat that makes them very resistant to radiation (i.e.,
A. niger, U. chartarum), and their role in the biodeterioration in general, particularly the
deterioration of materials on 188 and 0f the astronauts’ food spoilage as well as the identiﬁ-
cation, for some of them, in air samples from the orbital station.

During the short and the long space experiments on board the ISS, spores were not detached
from their wafers to contaminate the lids. Even if their surfaces are glossy 0r mat, all spores
were strongly attached on the surface of the wafers using the ornaments of their external walls,
preventing their spreading on the lids, either of the small plates 0r 0f the biocontainers.
Hydrophobines have an important role in the cell wall architecture and mediate attachment
to the substrate (Girardin et al. 1999; Fontaine et al. 2010; van Veluw et al. 2013). The quasi-
absence of air convection, as well as the isolated environment of the biocontainers (Gomoiu
et al. 2013), has additionally contributed in preventing the spread of fungal spores. In normal
growth conditions, either in the laboratory samples or in Petri dishes where the environmental
air has access to the cultures, convections have an important role in spreading the fungal spores
(Mims and Mims 2004; Bhattacharyya et al. 2015). The surface of polycarbonate and silicon
wafers was not degraded or altered in any way in both experiments showing that they could be
successfully used in microbial experiments onboard 188.

We suggest that, from the adhesion point of View, all types of wafers can be used in space
experiments with a special comment on the Viability in the particular case of iron wafers when
used for spores that belong to the halophilic species tested. The fact that fungal spores,
although dry, were not spread around in microgravity is very important for space experiments
because bacteria, yeast, and fungi could be cultivated in the same biocontainer without risking
contamination.

Viability of Spores
The present study demonstrates that the Viability of fungi differs depending on the strain and
the duration of the experiment, a conclusion that is in agreement with the results obtained by
Gérny et al. (2007). In this experiment the Viability of spores was found to be similar both for
short ﬂight and ground samples, while it was markedly lower in the long exposure experiment
to 18$ conditions than that of the short experiment for the species B. halophila and
C. herbarum. From the observations, it is suggested that the environment of the enclosed
biocontainer, as well as the species’ biology have an important effect, reducing the Viability in
time. This study also revealed high survivability on silica and iron wafer substrates. It has been
already observed in previous studies that spores of A. niger show reduced degrees of
survivability on copper surfaces compared to aluminium (Weaver et al. 2010); the Viability
and germination ofAspergillus species in general is not inhibited in other extreme conditions
such as elevated hydrostatic pressure and low temperature (Damare et al. 2008). Also, the
impact of O atoms has no effect on the Viability of A. niger spores and n0 etching of the
coatings of the spores occurs (Raballand et al. 2008). Now it is demonstrated that the same
structure of spores from samples from ground and ﬂight experiments sustains similar Viability

both after experiments of short and long exposure times to space conditions. Conidia of
Aspergillus and Ulocladium species and lichens are known to be resistant, surviving drought,
high temperatures, and UV radiation due to a melanized ce11wa11 that is also thick (Wyatt et a1.
2013; Ambiga et a1. 2013; Meessen et a1. 2013; Sarantopoulou et a1. 2011; De Nicolas-Santiago
et a1. 2006). Conidia of A. niger additionally contain genes that are involved in the synthesis of
protective compounds, including compatible solutes and protective hydrophilic proteins (Van
Leeuven et a1. 2013, Van Leeuwen et a1. 2013). Compatible solutes are assumed to protect
conidia against drought and heat stress (the disaccharide trehalose and the polyols manitol,
glycerol, erithreitol, arabinitol) and do not affect the function of the proteins and membranes
when they are accumulated in high concentrations inside the cell (Krijgsheld et a1. 2013).

Strong chemical reactions between iron ions and the salts that covered the spores of
B. halophila and formed by condensation in the humid atmosphere signiﬁcantly oxidized
the iron wafers during the long time experiment, resulting to reduced or complete loss of
Viability.

Microscopic Characterization of Spores

It was observed that during the long experiment on board 188, the outer layer as a part of the
spore coat was detached or completely lost without however affecting the Viability of the
spores since they were still protected by the middle and the inner layer of the coating.

A11 fungal spores that are used in the short and the long spaceﬂight experiments are covered
by a rod1et 1ayer. Krijgsheld et a1. (2013) observed that in Aspergillus sp. the hydrophobin gene
RodA becomes active during sporulation, so RodA protein is produced by sterigrnata and
diffuses to its outer surface and of the conidial surface that form the rod1et 1ayer. Latge et a1.
(1988) demonstrated also a rod1et1ayer on the conidial surfaces of C. herbamm. Hydrophobic
proteins found on the spore surface of Cladosporium (Sesartic et a1. 2013) make them more
sensitive to the toxicity of iron ions, in accordance with our results.

Ornamentation showing irregularly reticulate structures has been put in evidence after the
short and the long exposure time experiment. It was more evident on FIB-SEM cross sections
that after the long mission experiment ornamentations lose some of the irregularly reticulate
structures. We suggest that it was due to the long exposure of the spores in culture plates
integrated in biocontainer completely isolated from convection currents. Characteristic orna-
mentation of the surface of the spores has a taxonomic value (Heikkila et a1. 1988), but we can
also add physiological value that could explain the rate of germination and the spore’s Viability
after the spaceﬂight experiments. Condensation started at the early state of the germination
only in the case of U. chartamm spores, where we found germination tubes emerging from
one of the cells (Fig. 5). Spores of C. herbamm started to swell but germination did not take
place. Conidia of C. herbamm under SEM had surfaces with loosely irregularly reticulate
structure or embossed stripes, probably caused by the diminishing turgor and the shriveling of
the young conidia. Bensch et a1. (2012) reported similar results for the different species of
Cladosporium, including C. herbamm.

Morphology of Colonies

The morphological examination of the colonies obtained from the spores that were used for the
short and the long spaceﬂight experiments were originally made using the naked eye, then,
microscopic characterization was also performed. They did not show major changes most

experiment, from which germination tubes emerge at an early stage (see arrows). The substrate is iron
probably do to the absence of changes in the DNA. Past reports of experiments performed by
isolating mutants have shown changes in the shape and the size of the colonies (Radha et al.
2012), disordered polarized growth (Cai et al. 2014), low spore production (Baracho and
Baracho 2003), or highly increased spore production (Leonard et al. 2013).

The morphology of the colonies and their microscopic characteristics are considered as
essential tools for fungal identiﬁcation (Didier et al. 2014; Ogérek et al. 2012; Afzal et al.
2013) as well as for the characterization of mutants. Nowadays, for the identiﬁcation of new
fungal species polyphasic taxonomy uses different methods, such as morphology, physiology,
metabolite production and, very important, molecular data (Silva et al. 2011).

Dry Spores as Valuable Model in Astrobiological Research

In the ﬁeld of astrobiology this research highlights a new protocol to perform spaceﬂight
experiments with fungal spores in microgravity conditions, also under the additional effect of
possible cosmic radiation. According to this protocol the results are expressed in terms of
Viability, and of microscopic and morphological changes.

To perform similar space experiments, plastic, silicon and iron wafer substrates can be
successfully used. However, when iron wafers are used as substrates for spores belonging to
halophilic strains, such as Basipetospom halophila, iron oxidation effects should be taken into
account.

The fact that dried fungal spores are not spread around in microgravity conditions is very
important for subsequent space experiments, indicating that also experiments using bacteria,
yeasts, and fungi could be performed in the same biocontainer without any risk of
contamination.

In the future, the ESA exposure facility EXPOSE with different microorganisms can be also
performed without any contamination risk.

Finally, our results suggest that the spores of A. niger, C. herbarum, U. chartarum,
and B. halophila are resistant also for the long spaceﬂight experiment. We agree with the
hypothesis of Kawaguchi et al. (2013) that aggregated cells of Deinococcus could sustain
“massapanspermia” and therefore, it is suggested that this can be tested to be true also
with aggregated spores of A. niger and U. chartarum. This could be evidence that the life
on Earth came from outer space most probably as aggregated bacteria cells and aggre-
gated fungal spores.
