Abstract
We differentiated mouse bone marrow cells in the presence of recombinant macrophage colony stimulating (rM-CSF) factor for
14 days during the ﬂight of space shuttle Space Transportation System (STS)-l26. We tested the hypothesis that the receptor expression
for M-CSF, c-Fms was reduced. We used ﬂow cytometry to assess molecules on cells that were preserved during ﬂight to deﬁne the dif-
ferentiation state of the developing bone marrow macrophages; including CDllb, CD31, CD44, Ly6C, Ly6G, F4/80, Ma02, c-Fos as
well as c—Fms. In addition, RNA was preserved during the ﬂight and was used to perform a gene microarray. We found that there were
signiﬁcant differences in the number of macrophages that developed in space compared to controls maintained on Earth. We found that
there were signiﬁcant changes in the distribution of cells that expressed CD1 lb, CD31, F4/ 80, Ma02, Ly6C and c-Fos. However, there
were no changes in c-Fms expression and no consistent pattern of advanced or retarded differentiation during space ﬂight. We also found
a pattern of transcript levels that would be consistent with a relatively normal differentiation outcome but increased proliferation by the
bone marrow macrophages that were assayed after 14 days of space ﬂight. There also was a surprising pattern of space ﬂight inﬂuence on
genes of the coagulation pathway. These data conﬁrm that a space ﬂight can have an impact on the in vitro development of macrophages
from mouse bone marrow cells.
