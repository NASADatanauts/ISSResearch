Abstract: The JEM-EUSO focal surface detector consists of about 300,000 photodetector channels that are organized
into 137 building blocks called Photo-Detector Module (PDM). A PDM is composed of 36 64-ch MAPMTs, analog
ASICs, and digital electronics. The digital electronics, called PDM board, is in charge of readout of 36 MAPMTs Via
ASICs, control of ASICs Via JEM- EUSO central data acquisition system, Level-l trigger with decision every JEM-
EUSO time unit of 2.5 us, and buffering of a complete event of Extreme Energy Cosmic Rays typically lasting 200 us.
On positive trigger, the data of 8 adjacent PDMs is transferred to Cluster Control Board where Level-2 trigger is
processed to reﬁne the selection of interesting events. We expect the rate of Level-l trigger is designed to be 7 Hz
with 2 kHz of input data. We present the development of the PDM board for the JEM-EUSO experiment.

5 The PDM prototype board

The prototype board has been built as shown in Figure 2
(left) and tested mainly for interfacing t0 ASIC and im-
plementation of reduced version of trigger algorithms.
The USB-8451(NI) is used for the control and data trans-
fer Via PC. The test is successful as expected from the
design. The PDM sends 40 MHz and GTU clocks to
ASIC, then ASIC issues a series of loading of 8 bit data
to be transferred to PDM. Total 64 pixels photon count-
ing data are received at PDM Via 8 lines. A text ﬁle of the
data is sent from ASIC t0 PDM, and opened at PC, Where
each of 8 lines receives 8 bits data. The next step is to
test the transfer of data to CCB and to implement the full
Level 1 trigger algorithm in FPGA.
