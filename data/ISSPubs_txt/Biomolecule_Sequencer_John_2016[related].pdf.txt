However, a major limitation of traditional DNA or
RNA sequencing methods for life detection elsewhere
in the solar system is that they can sequence only DNA
or RNA. If life existed elsewhere but used informational
molecules other than DNA or RNA, conventional
sequencers would not be able to obtain sequence data,
even from closely related nucleic acid analogs such as
arabinose or threose nucleic acids (Figure 3). Because
nanopore based sequencers such as the the MinIONTM
measure changes in current based on the polymer
passing through them, they can also read RNA, proteins,
and other polymers as well [13]. Thus, nanopore-based
sequencing provides much greater versatility as a life
