Objective: First popularized as neurasthenia in the late 1800s by American George Beard, asthenia has been Viewed
by Russian psychologists and ﬂight surgeons as a major problem that affects cosmonauts participating in long—
duration space missions. However, there is some controversy about whether this syndrome exists in space; this
controversy is attributable in part to the fact that it is not recognized in the current American psychiatric diagnostic
system. Methods: To address this issue empirically, we retrospectively examined the data from our 4 1/2-year,
NASA—funded study of crew member and mission control interactions during the Shuttle/Mir space program. Three
of the authors identified eight items of stage 1 asthenia from one of our measures, the Profile of Mood States (POMS).
Scores on these items from 13 Russian and American crew members were compared with scores derived from the
opinions of six Russian space experts. Results: Crew members’ scores in space were significantly lower than the
experts’ scores on seven of the eight items, and they generally were in the “not at all” to “a little” range of the item
scales. There were no differences in mean scores before and after launch or across the four quarters of the missions.
There were no differences in response between Russian and American crew members. Conclusions: We could not
demonstrate the presence of asthenia in space as operationally defined using the POMS. However, the POMS
addresses only emotional and not physiological aspects of the syndrome, and the subject responses in our study
generally were skewed toward the positive end of the scales. Further research on this syndrome needs to be done
and should include physiological measures and measures that are specific to asthenia. Key words: asthenia,
