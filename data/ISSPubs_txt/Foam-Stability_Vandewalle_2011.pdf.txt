Abstract. Within the context of the ESA FOAM project, we have studied the stability of
aqueous and non—aqueous foams both on Earth and in microgravity. Foams are dispersions of
gas into liquid or solid. On Earth, the lifetime of a foam is limited by the free drainage. By
drainage, we are referring to the irreversible ﬂow of liquid through the foam (leading to the
accumulation of liquid at the foam bottom, and to a global liquid content decreases within the
foam). When the liquid ﬁlms become thinner, they eventually break, and the foam collapses.
In microgravity, this process is no more present and foams containing large amounts of liquid
can be studied for longer time. While the difference between foaming and not—foaming solutions
is Clear, the case Of slightly—foaming solutions is more complicated. On Earth, such mixtures
are observed to produce unstable froth for a couple of seconds. However, these latter solutions
may produce foam in microgravity. We have studied both conﬁgurations for different solutions
composed of common surfactant, proteins, anti—foaming agents or silicon oil. Surprising results
have been Obtained, emphasizing the role played by gravity on the foam stabilization process.
1. Introduction
Foams occur widely in nature and in important industrial processes and commercial applications
[1]. Foams are made of Closely packed gas bubbles in a liquid, typically water with an added
surfactant. The liquid volume fraction 90 may vary from less than one 1% (dry foam) to around
35% (wet foam). At low volume fractions, the bubbles are deformed into polyhedra. Most of
the liquid is conﬁned in the bubble edges called “Plateau borders”, connecting three ﬁlms and
which are themselves interconnected by “nodes”.

Gravity plays an important role in the formation of foam and its subsequent evolution. Its
primary effect is to cause excess liquid to drain rapidly away. When the foam is stable enough,
it becomes dry and the gravitational force is balanced by a vertical capillary—pressure gradient
in the liquid and hence a vertical proﬁle of liquid fraction is established. The addition of
liquid to such a dry foam at the top results initially in a solitary wave with an approximately
constant proﬁle during its downward passage. Subsequently, a state of uniform drainage, with
a constant volume fraction, is established. A sample undergoing such “forced” drainage can be
used to study homogeneous wet foams, but only up to about 90 : 20% liquid fraction, beyond
which various dynamic instabilities (primarily convection) occur. In the case of rheology, a very

interesting transition occurs at 900 w 35% where the foam Changes from liquid—like (disconnected
bubbles) to solid—like (ﬁnite shear modulus). This is the “jamming transition” also encountered
in other assemblies of randomly packed objects, such as emulsions, sand, Clays, etc. When
90 > 900 w 35%, the bubbles are spherical and move independently. Unfortunately, in the ease
of foams, the 20%—35% range, which extends to the wet foam limit at which individual bubbles
separate, remains inaccessible on Earth. This limits present experiments to stable dry foams,
and indeed the idealized theoretical models are largely conﬁned to the dry foam limit as well.

A zero gravity study of wet foam hydrodynamics allows one to overcome the limits imposed
by various instabilities experienced under normal gravity [2, 3, 4]. This broader experimental
Characterization and corresponding insight will provide a scientiﬁcally valid alternative for the
necessarily conservative empirioism currently employed to estimate the operational window and
design for foam handling in industrial processes (such as gas/liquid contacting, ﬂotation and
pumping).

Miorogravity experiments on foams represent therefore a big Challenge for scientists. Within
our collaboration, parabolic ﬂight campaigns were conducted for testing foaming processes and
more recently the FOAM—S mission took place on 188 for studying the stability of a foam. Some
of the results of the latter experiment are detailed in the present paper. Unexpected behaviours
will be emphasized.

2. FOAM-S mission

FOAM—S beneﬁted from a ﬂight opportunity to the 188 in 2009 during the stay of astronaut
Frank DeWinne. The experiment consisted in shaking various solutions both on Earth and in
the 188 in order to study the inﬂuence of gravity on foamability and stability of foams. For that
purpose, a small rack, illustrated in Figure 1, has been specially built. It contains 12 cylindrical
transparent oells (polycarbonate, height : 40 mm, inner diameter : 12 mm) containing a liquid
solution. The liquid volume fraction is Close to 30% for all samples. This is our Choice for
studying foams near the critical liquid fraction 906. Each cell contains also a spherical ceramic
bead used for the foaming process. The diameter of the bead (11 mm) is slightly smaller than
the tube inner diameter. When the rack is hand shaken by the astronaut during 10 seconds,
the bead motion provides enough shear stress along the tube wall and foam is created within a
few oscillations of the bead. After shaking, the tubes are placed in front of a light source and
images are recorded thanks to a high resolution Video recorder during 30 minutes.

A total of 60 Closed cells containing various foaming solutions were embarked in 5 racks.
Various samples have been tested. Among others, solutions were pure liquids, water surfactant
mixtures including protein based agents. Antifoaming agents were also tested as well as for a
Chocolate foam. The samples were sent on 188 in 2009 (see Figure 2). Images have been returned
to scientiﬁc teams during winter 2010. In order to compare to normal gravity conditions, ground
based experiments have been performed using the same apparatus. First results are described
in the next section.

The pictures of the 60 samples recorded on the 188 have been collected and analyzed. Typical
pictures of foam created in cylindrical cells are shown in Figure 3 for four different solutions
both in zero gravity and Earth conditions: SDS7 TTAB7 casein and anti—foaming agent Rodorsil
TF1 © With SDS. One observes Clear differences between 0g and 1g7 as well as strong differences
between samples. For example7 the last sample of Figure 3 corresponds to an antifoam agent
mixed in a SDS solution. The amount of foam created in micro—gravity seems more important

than observed on Earth. However7 the foam is stable when the system is shaken in microgravity.
This behavior was completely unexpected since anti—foaming agents are meant to avoid foam
creation and stabilisation [5].

In order to measure the foamability of each solution [6], the amount of foam (1), ranging
between 0% and 100%7 created by shaking is measured on the pictures by image analysis.
Foamability CI) is the volume fraction occupied by the foam only. It does neither consider the
presence of the bead nor the presence of the remaining liquid. A rectangular zone is selected on
the middle of a tube7 in order to avoid the effect of the tube curvature. Such a rectangular zone
is illustrated in Figure 3 by a black frame. A binarization threshold is applied to distinguish the
foam from the rest of the tube: the foam appears in black. Then7 the total area of the black
region7 representing the amount CI) of foam in the tube7 is measured. The collected data are
averaged over different runs. Table 1 summarizes our results. Among others7 solutions shown
in Figure 3 are denoted by a star “*”. Note that in most eases7 the foamability is almost two
times larger on the 188 than on Earth. One exception is the solution of silica beads ©whiCh
was already very stable in Earth conditions [7]. A striking result is that a non—foaming solution
on Earth exhibits a signiﬁcant foam column in space ! This behaviour was unexpected.

series. Figures 4, 5 and 6 present a semi—log plot of the foam fraction CI) in cell as a function of
time (after hand shaking at time t : 0). Different dynamical behaviors should be emphasized.
In 1g, a typical foam column collapses signiﬁcantly Within 30 seconds before starting a slow
decrease for the remaining foam. The Characteristic time scales for this decay depends mainly
on the foaming agent since various physiCO—Chemieal processes are involved : drainage, ﬁlm
ruptures, bubble reorganisations. One can note a signiﬁeative difference between foams made
at 0g and 1g as already noted in Figure 3. In most cases, the quantity of foam is larger in 0g
(the tubes are almost totally ﬁlled with foam made With the SDS). This is true for solutions
under and above the CMC, and also for solutions With anti—foaming agent Rodorsil TF1 ©.
Moreover, these foams are showing a remarkable stability: the dynamics of (I) present a nearly
ﬂat curve in 0g. The amount (I) decreases rapidly in less than one minute before reaching a
minimum. Whatever the Observed solution on Earth, a Characteristic time can be extracted,
Which is always around a few tens of seconds, Whereas it is not the ease in 0g. After ten seconds,
the 0g foams are stabilized and n0 evolution is Observed.

Figure 5 presents the results for TTAB solution above and below the CMC. The 0g foam
shows a greater stability, and the quantity of foam is signiﬁcatively more important than under
gravity except for the solution of 0.34g/ L of TTAB for which the quantities of foams are the
same With and Without gravity. After ten seconds, the Og—foams are stabilized and do not evolve
further. Figure 6 shows the evolution of foam for solution of casein. The foams made in the
ISS present a great stability even if a weak decay can be Observed during all the experiments
and ﬁll the tube four times more than foam produced on Earth. One should also note that
sudden ﬂuctuations are seen in one Of the series around 15 : 40 s. This is due to a moving
object or astronaut near the experiment modifying the lightning. Such an experimental artefact
is hopefully very rare.

4. Discussion
Mierogravity experiments allowed us to explore a new sort of foams With liquid fractions around
90 : 30%. On Earth, such materials are unstable and most of the time not called foams but
bubbly liquid. The liquid fraction is indeed so high that the bubbles can keep their spherical
shape allowing to minimize their free energy. In contrary, at smaller liquid fractions, bubbles are
connected to others bubbles and deformed: the surface of bubbles is ﬂatten due to the gravity
driven liquid ﬂow through Plateau borders. The main process Which controls the stability of
a foam on Earth is the free drainage driven by gravity. Film thinning in the foam leads to a
global decrease of the cell srtueture as observed in all data for lg, even When the foaming agent
is present. The thinner ﬁlms indeed allow a faster gas transfer and, thus a faster coarsening.
Moreover, they tend to reach a critical thickness at Which they become unstable and burst. In
0 g, drainage is suppressed such that liquid ﬁlms remains thick. Because 90 : 30%, the foam
remains wet. Bubble coalescence events are nevertheless seen, explaining a decrease of (I) on
some plots. However, after some time, bubble motions become rare events such that the foam
is more stable.

Note that the critical mieellar concentration (CMC) is usually used to describe roughly the
foamability. It is actually well known that a minimum concentration (around the CMC) is
needed to create foam on Earth. Moreover, it has been observed that foamability is maximal
around the CMC. This is actually due to surfactants remobilization. At large concentrations, the
liquid indeed contains a large quantity of surfactants even after ﬁlling the surface. Hence, a small
surface gradient is rapidly compensated by surfactants exchanges With the bulk and the surface
elasticity is drastically decreased leading to smaller stability [10, 11]. As a result, on Earth, low
concentration solutions do not foam or lead to unstable foams. Note that the considerations
concerning surface rheology are still valid in the ISS but the foamability is also good for small
concentrations. Then, it seems that in 0g, the CMC is no more a good order of magnitude for
the frontier between stable and unstable foams. Indeed, surface rheology becomes important
as soon as the ﬁlms become very thin and can burst [8]. Concerning the results different on
Earth and in space, there are also proteins Which behave differently. In this case, it is worth
noticing that they need quite a long time to reach the interface [10]. Actually, on Earth, foams

stabilized by proteins (as well as particles) are very stable once generated but are very difﬁcult
to generate [11]. Obviously, 0n the 188, the drainage is reduced giving time to the proteins to
reach the interface. The various physical ingredients behind this unexpected stability have to
be identiﬁed. We believe that the liquid fraction is an important parameter as tested in earlier
parabolic ﬂights.

5. Conclusion

From the FOAM—S experiment, we discovered the possibibilty to create super stable aqueous
foams in zero gravity conditions. Even on Earth, coarsening and ﬁlm ruptures are always present
for a solution with foaming agents. In zero gravity, the foam evolves certainly but the amount of
foam (I) does not appear to Change signiﬁcantly. Surprisingly, antifoaming agents have a reduced
effect in microgravity, and this particular foam appears to be stable. This result raises new
fundamental questions that should be investigated in future works.

In the FOAM—S experiment, cells have been ﬁlled with the same quantity of liquid (around
30% Close to the rigidity loss transition). New experiments are needed to study the effect of this
parameter 0n the amount of generated foam.
