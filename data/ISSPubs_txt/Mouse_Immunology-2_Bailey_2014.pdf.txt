both PDH and D suggest prolonged microgravity effectively diminished biomechanical properties of
caudal discs. By contrast, differences were not noted for lumbar discs. This potentially deleterious
interaction between prolonged weightlessness and differential ranges of motion along the spine may
underlie the increased cervical versus lumbar disc herniation rates observed among astronauts.

Fig. 4. Comparison of ROM between murine lumbar and caudal discs: on the left is a murine L4/L5 motion segment, positioned in the maximum degree of extension before
inﬂicting damage. Angle of the disc space measured 25 degrees. Posterior elements are seen on the right side of the vertebral column. On the right is a murine C8/C9 motion
segment, also positioned in maximum degree of extension before inﬂicting damage. Angle measured was 600. These pictures demonstrate an example of the difference in
ROM between the murine lumbar and caudal disc. Segments came from an unrelated, skeletally mature, murine specimen. Scale bar=0.25 mm.
