Abstract
The Alteriss project aims to perform a long term survey of the radiation environment on board the International Space Station. Mea—
surements are being performed With active and passive devices in different locations and orientations of the Russian segment of the sta—
tion. The goal is to perform a detailed evaluation of the differences in particle ﬂuence and nuclear composition due to different shielding
material and attitude of the station. The Sileye—3/Alteino detector is used to identify nuclei up to Iron in the energy range above
=60 MeV/n. Several passive dosimeters (TLDs, CR39) are also placed in the same location of Sileye—3 detector. Polyethylene shielding
is periodically interposed in front of the detectors to evaluate the effectiveness of shielding 0n the nuclear component of the cosmic radi—
ation. The project was submitted to BSA in reply to the A0 in the Life and Physical Science of 2004 and data taking began in December
2005. Dosimeters and data cards are rotated every 6 months: up to now three launches 0f dosimeters and data cards have been performed
and have been returned With the end of expedition 12 and 13.
