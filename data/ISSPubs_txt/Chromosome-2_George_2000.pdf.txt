Abstract

To obtain information on the cytogenetic damage caused by space radiation, chromosome exchanges in lymphocytes from

crewrnernbers of long-term Mir missions, and a shorter duration shuttle mission, were examined using ﬂuorescence in situ

hybridization. A significant increase in chromosomal aberrations was observed after the long duration ﬂights. The ratio of aberrations

identified as complex was higher post-ﬂight for some crewrnernbers, which is thought to be an indication of eXposure to high-LET

radiation. Ground-based studies have shown that the frequency of aberrations measured post-ﬂight could be inﬂuenced by a mitotic

delay in cells damaged by high-LET radiation and this effect could lower biological dose estimates. To counteract this effect,

prematurely condensed chromosome (PCC) spreads were collected. Frequencies of aberrations in FCC were compared with those

in metaphase spreads.

KEYWORDS: Biodosimetry, chromosomes, high-LET, FISH.
