Figure 2. Ultrastructure of parotid glands of ﬂight mice. Panel A, STS-135: Acinar cells have basally located
nuclei [N (binucleate cells are c0mm0n)], a prominent Golgi complex (G), and abundant apically located
secretory granules (SG). Intercellular canaliculus (IC). Scale bar = 2 pm. Panel B, STS-135: Intercalated
duct. The duct cells have apical vacuoles (arrows) containing material endocytosed from the lumen (L). Scale
bar = 2 pm. The inset shows a similar vacuole in a striated duct cell immunogold labeled for PSP, an acinar
secretory protein. Scale bar = 0.5 pm. Panel C, Bion-Ml: A recently formed autophagic vacuole (AV1)
containing secretory proteins labeled for PSP is present in an acinar cell. An older autophagic vacuole (AV2)
contains remnants of secretory granules and other organelles, but shows little labeling. Secretory granule
(SG); nucleus (N). Scale bar = 1 pm. Panel D, Bion-Ml: Apoptotic acinar cells (Apop) phagocytosed by a
macrophage (arrowheads). Myoepithelial cell (MEC). Scale bar = 2 pm.

Figure 6. Densitometric analysis of polyacrylamide gel electrophoretic protein separation and anti—RII and
anti—a—amylase reactivity in STS-135 mice. Panel A: Top panel, ﬂight; middle panel, Vivarium; and bottom
panel, habitat parotid gland samples. The lighter curve represents the protein proﬁle; the shaded area is the
reactivity to anti—RII antibody. The ordinate axes are integrated density values of the proteins on the left
hand axis, and the integrated density values for R1] and the reactivity of R11 fragment (Rfr) 0n the right hand
axis. Panel B shows parotid oc-amylase Western blotting. The ordinate shows integrated density, and the
error bars show i 5% error. F, ﬂight; C1, Vivarium control; C2, habitat control.
