"2","I. Introduction
T he earliest theoretical treatments of droplet combustion assume spherical symmetry in Which the droplet and
ﬂame are concentric and the ﬂow is due entirely to evaporation at the droplet surfacel’z. The resulting droplet
burning conﬁguration is of the ﬂame and droplet as concentric spheres With the streamlines 0f the evaporation-
induced ﬂow in the radial direction, as schematically shown in Fig. 1. This is the base case for liquid fuel
combustion and a canonical conﬁguration because of its inherent modelability. If the fuel forms soot during burning
the soot aggregates (Which Will be on the fuel-rich side of the droplet diffusion ﬂame) Will be trapped between the
droplet and ﬂame at a radial position Where the forces acting on them balance, coming principally from
thermophoresis and drag associated With the evaporation-induced ﬂow”. A soot “shell” results.
The classical theory of droplet combustion leads
to a scaling of the evolution of droplet diameter as

in contrast to Eq. (2). In particular, the broad trends are that for burning in a cold ambience the burning rate
decreases With increasing D0. * This trend has not been fully explained, owing in part to the inability to model all of
the important processes in droplet burning (i.e., unsteady transport, variable properties, soot formation, radiation,
complex combustion chemistry). Scale analysis40’41 as applied to droplet burning offers capabilities to develop an
understanding of the important variables involved. Appendix A discusses this approach. The problem is cast in
terms of K, though droplet size is expected to also inﬂuence the relative position of the ﬂame and soot shell to the
droplet. Three regimes of burning based on D0 are identiﬁed as depicted in schematic form in Fig. 2, based on heat
transfer from the ﬂame to the droplet and ambience in terms of radiation and conduction transport. A single burning
rate for a given droplet history is shown by the theory though we know that K is time dependent owing to unsteady

during the burning process.
Neglecting radiation (regime I in Fig. 2), the scale analysis presented in Appendix A leads to the burning rate
being independent of Do. This trend is consistent with detailed numerical modeling that also predicts K to be
independent of DO 9’14. This approximation would remain in effect for droplet sizes down to those found in sprays 41'
43 l. The lower range of droplet diameter for radiation to be unimportant is indicated as D01 in Fig. 2 where the soot
shell will not form. For very large DO where radiative losses from the ﬂame to the ambience are more important than
diffusive transport (regime III) an energy balance (discussed in Appendix A) on the ﬂame leads to an inverse power
relationship, K 0C L, where n=2/7. Unique affects such as radiative extinctionlo’33’34’45 and cool ﬂame phenomena
D3
4648 may also be important in this regime. An intermediate regime (II) where both radiation and diffusive transport
are important would bridge regimes I and III.
Scale analysis does not provide quantitative information about the DO boundaries for the various regimes in Fig.

Li The above discussion shows the importance of DO on the droplet burning process, more speciﬁcally the droplet

E burning rate. Prior data have covered DO values of about 2 mm or smaller which gives an incomplete picture of the
mechanisms that control the burning process as the mass of fuel is increased. Here, we report quantitative data and
qualitative observations of the droplet burning process covering the range of 0.5 mm to about 5 mm, which is also
the largest range thus far consolidated into a single study. It is important to note that the motivation for studying the
burning process of the large droplets at the upper end of this range in no way is meant to suggest the relevance of
droplets for DO ~ 5 mm to practical spray systems. To the contrary, typical DO values in spray ﬂames are on the
lHowever, soot is of course found in spray ﬂames. For a spray the relevant physical scale when the ﬂame encloses
the spray is the overall extent of the multiphase zone, which is much larger than the diameter of indiVidual droplets.
3:For alcohols such as methanol an additional complication to the burning process is the solubility of water in the
droplet that can occur through condensation at the droplet surface as the droplet burns. This affect will also
contribute to a nonlinear burning rate9. For the alkanes discussed in this paper, this affect is not important owing to
the low solubility of water in the hydrocarbons investigated.

the other hand, the physical processes that emerge to control burning as DO increases are very much relevant to
combustion of spray systems even if the actual droplet diameters are not.

The Virtue of examining the droplet burning process in the context of Fig. 1 is, therefore, to provide quantitative
measurements over the widest possible range of DO consistent with the available experimental facilities. The
understanding of processes known to eXist in large (e.g., spray) systems can still be derived from observations on the
scale of individual isolated droplets, where it is recognized that moving boundary, radiative and unsteady transport
dynamics remain as the length scale of a spray is reduced to the base case of spherical symmetryC.

The fuels employed in the present study are n-heptane, n-octane, and n-decane. A selected set of properties are
given in Table 1. Their detailed combustion chemistry is known and they are representative of a chemical class that
is prominent in real transportation fuels5 1. Being also in a series of straight chain hydrocarbons the results will
facilitate an understanding of how hydrocarbons in such a series burn and respond to changes across the wide range
DO investigated.

Q because it would also reduce the sooting propensity that is an important element of the present study.

A low gravity environment is achieved by carrying out the experiments under free-fall conditions in a
gravitational ﬁeld. The test droplet is deployed in a sealed chamber containing the desired combustion gases (room
temperature air in the present study), and the chamber with associated instrumentation attached to it is then literally
placed into free-fall while test droplets are burned. This state of free fall is realized here in facilities on the ground
(“ground-based” (GB)) and within the environment of the International Space Station (188). ll
§D0 is used as the characteristic length scale since the ﬂame diameter is proportional to D from Eq. (3).
llOther variants of carrying out droplet burning experiments under free-fall conditions include aircraft ﬂying parabolic trajectories
53 and rockets launched in sub-orbital ﬂight paths54’55. Rockets can be cumbersome facilities to use“, while for aircraft the gravity
levels relative to the earth’s value are on the order of 10'3 or higher and the presence of turbulence and aircraft ﬂuctuations can
degrade the gravitational quality and the combustion symmetry.

"
"5","The gravity level in the moving frame of reference is commensurate with the air drag around the instrumentation
package within which the experiments are carried out. For the GB conﬁguration the affects of air drag are
minimized by placing the inner package containing the hardware within a larger outer box that falls independently of
the inner package (a so-called “drag shield”). In the ISS, the orbital trajectory (at about 205 miles, Fig. 3a) is of such
an elevation that the low pressure gases surrounding the ISS platform do not exert any signiﬁcant air drag on the
ISS. For the GB and ISS environments, the gravitational ﬁeld - g/gO < ~ 10'5 - is sufﬁcient13’25’34’56 to promote a near
one-dimensional transport dynamic. Figures 3b and 30 show images from ISS experiments (described in Section
III.A) for an n-decane droplet burning in normal atmospheric pressure air that illustrate the sort of spherical
symmetry of the ﬂame (3b) and soot (3c) conﬁgurations that can be achieved in the enVironment of the ISS. The
soot shell (Fig. 1) is clearly Visible in Fig. 30 that illustrates soot aggregates tapped between the droplet and ﬂame.
Deviations from this state of combustion symmetry would be due to extraneous effects associated with ignition
disturbances, drift of the droplets (for the free-ﬂoating drops of the ISS), and ﬁber inﬂuences (for the GB studies).

In the present investigation, the burning dynamics of a wide range of initial droplet diameters are investigated:

a 0.5 mm < DO < 0.8 mm in a drop tower; and 1.19 mm < DO < 5 mm in the ISS. This range would constitute the

E largest thus far reported in a single study. The experimental facilities employed provide sufﬁcient time to form and

5 The need for the GB and ISS facilities employed in the present study is motivated by the range of droplet sizes of
interest and their corresponding burning times. Figure 4 shows the variation of DO with tb from Eq. (1) (as a
reasonable estimate from the classical theory) for two typical burning rates3 5 ’3 7’5 1. At 1.2s there is theoretically still
sufﬁcient time to observe the complete burning history of a DO < 1.5 mm droplet. In reality, droplets must be less
than about 0.8 mm when considering other events prior to the start of burning in the GB facility (e.g., duration that
the ignition coils are activated, and settling time of the instrumentation package after releasing it into free-fall). For
the ISS the experimental time is unlimited and Virtually any size droplet can be examined, though data storage
capacity limits the droplet size to about DO < 6 mm for alkanes and alcohols. In practice, DO > 1.5 mm owing to the
challenge of deploying droplets with minimum drift with the experimental design (Section III.A) used for smaller
droplets.

The cross-hatched zone in Fig. 4 signiﬁes the narrow range of DO that was inaccessible in the present
investigation (i.e., too small for the ISS; too large for the GB facility). The data obtained suggest that this
inaccessible range of DO was not a deterrent to the understanding of the results.

"6","III. Experimental Methods
A. ISS

An experimental design was developed to form, deploy and ignite free ﬂoating droplets in the low gravity
environment of the ISS (see Fig. 3a). The droplet combustion hardware (i.e., the Multi-user Droplet Combustion
Apparatus (MDCA)) is housed Within the so-called ”Combustion Integrated Rack"" (CIR) 0f the ISS. The MDCA
incorporates capabilities to record the droplet burning history using digital black and White (BW) and color
Videography. An overall schematic of the MDCA conﬁguration is shown in Fig. 5a. An outline of the hardware and
procedures are presented here. More details of the hardware design are provided elsewhere57'59.

The ISS instrumentation package includes Video cameras to record the droplet burning process and the droplet
deployment and ignition systems. The main diagnostic of the experiments is digital Video imaging. Three digital
Video cameras were used With all operating at 30 frames/s. A Hi-Beam camera records black and White silhouette
images of the droplet and soot shell (e.g., Fig. 3c); a color camera records ﬂame-illuminated images that illustrate

2 the boundary of the outer luminous zone of the ﬂame (Fig. 3b) from Which the ”ﬂame"" diameter is obtained; and a
E lOW-light-level ultraviolet (LLLUV) camera captures the 320 nm OH emission spectra as an alternative marker of
§ the ﬂame position. For all experiments, images from each of these cameras are analyzed for each experimental run.

The experiments are carried out in a sealed combustion chamber that is charged With the standard atmosphere
(other inerts besides nitrogen can be accommodated as well). The MDCA was designed to provide unsupported 0r
free-ﬂoating droplets With minimal drift to promote combustion symmetry. Once ignited the droplet burning process
is recorded by the Video cameras, and the results are temporarily stored in the data storage units on the ISS until
scheduled downlink events.

A number of designs have been developed for forming and deploying free-ﬂoating droplets for combustion
experiments60. The one in the MDCA is schematically illustrated in Figs. 5b to 5d. The test droplets are formed by
ﬁrst dispensing fuel through two opposed (250 pm diameter) needles With polished and ﬂuted ends, and separated
by a small distance to create a liquid bridge (Fig. 5b). The liquid bridge is then stretched slightly (Fig. SC) to
minimize drift velocity and internal circulation after the droplet is deployed. The needles are rapidly retracted (Fig.
5d) and the liquid is then separated from the needles. The retraction rate is carefully controlled so that both needles

period of oscillation at which point the now free—ﬂoating (and nearly stationary) droplet is ready to be ignited (Fig.
51).

The ignition process is accomplished by rapid heating of the gases near to the droplet by hot wires that are
energized shortly after the needles are retracted. Thereafter, the droplet burns in an unobstructed ambience (Fig. 5g)
to produce the sort of combustion symmetry shown in Fig. 3b and 30.

Several adjustments are often found necessary in order

E4 Figure 8b shows the positions of the imaging cameras used to record the droplet burning process. A black and
a white (BW) camera (Canadian Photonic Labs, MS-80K) records the backlit droplet and soot shell at 200 fps with an
a image quality of 3.9 MP/frame. A color camera (Hitachi HV-CZO) records self—illuminated images of the droplet
E ﬂames at 30 fps with a quality of 0.3 MP/frame. The following lenses are ﬁtted on a C-mount adapter installed on
(g the BW camera: an Olympus Zuiko 90mm f/2.0 lens, an Olympus OM Telescopic Extension Tube 65—116 mm
8 (ﬁxed at 100 mm), and a ViVitar MC 2X teleconverter. For the color camera, a Nikkor 135 mm f/2.0 lens and two
E Kenko 36 mm extension tubes were used.
f: To deploy a droplet onto the support ﬁbers, a droplet generator (Fig. 80) propels one or more droplets from the
(<20: nozzle onto two 14 pm SiC ﬁber ﬁlaments (Fig. 80) that are crossed at 600 until the droplet reaches the desired size.
3 With the test droplet positioned at the intersection of the two ﬁbers (Fig. 8d), the entire package is released into free-
§ fall by deactivating an electro-magnet (Fig. 8a) that initially held the package to initiate a low gravity experiment.
Li During the fall, the droplet is ignited by two parallel sparks across two pairs of electrodes (Fig. 8d) and the burning
E process is then recorded. Though the 188 design employs hot wire ignition and the drop tower experiments using
ignition by spark discharge, it was previously shown38 that the spark and hot wire ignition approaches gave very
similar results. The test droplets were ignited 300 ms after the period of free-fall began to eliminate a shaking affect
that was observed upon separation of the instrumentation package from the electromagnet.

To ensure that the ﬁber-mounted droplets produced results that were not substantially inﬂuenced by the support
ﬁber (e.g., ﬁber-induced motion in the gas that could inﬂuence the burning rate), some limited experiments using the
procedures for developing unsupported droplets in the GB facility were carried out for n-decane and compared with
the ﬁber-mounted droplets. Figure XX compares free and ﬁber-supported droplets for n-decane. As is evident both D
and Df are well represented by the data from the supported droplet conﬁguration. The results conﬁrm earlier
conclusionszs’37 that the burning rates of the freely ﬂoating and ﬁber mounted droplets were close to each other. On
the other hand, the ﬁber support perturbed the soot structure and promoted aggregates to stick to the ﬁber during the
burning process“.

a C. Image Analyses and Data Reduction
Q Quantitative measurements of the droplet (D), soot shell (D5) and ﬂame (Df) were extracted from analysis of
(:5: individual frames of the Video record of the burning process. Details of the image reduction process are discussed
E. elsewhere63. For the data reported in this paper, over 8000 images were available for analysis. A subset of these
g images were analyzed to construct the evolutions of D, Df and DS presented in Section IV.
3 Figures 9a and 9d show images that illustrate the droplet boundary identiﬁed by the image analysis software
E (outlined by green circles around the droplet boundary) by the process described in Ref35’63. From the same BW
5 images, soot shell diameters are measured in a manual process using a commercial software package (Image—Pro
Plus V6.3) that is used to place a circle around the droplet 0r soot shell. As illustrated in Figs. 9b and 9e, the
asymmetric part of the soot shell is excluded and the circle extended around the circumference. This asymmetry
comes from either early soot shell distortion (due to 18$ igniters retraction) or incident soot aggregation at one angle
such that it has less physical meaning regarding the position where the soot particles are situated as a result of the
“force balance” between Stefan drag, diffusion—phoresis and thermophoresis3'5. It is important to note that the
hydrocarbons investigated in this study produce soot almost everywhere within the ﬂame area. The soot shell
diameter only indicates where very small soot particles (instead of more massive soot aggregates) are positioned
inside the spherically symmetric ﬂame.
Figure 9c and 9f illustrate the sort of ﬂame—illuminated image from which Df is typically obtained. The dotted
circle is manually positioned using the Image—Pro software, and is placed around the outer blue zone. Figure 9g
shows a selected LLLUV image, which is much fainter. The dotted circle again is manually placed to determine a
diameter according to OH emissions.

millimeters) with the aid of a 0.79 mm precision tungsten carbide ball bearing for the GB images. For 188 images,
the reference scale was provided by recording a series printed black circle images (with know sizes) for each camera
(color and LLLUV).

5 IV. Results and Discussions

E Figures 10 to 12 show a selected set of images of the burning histories of n-heptane, n-octane and n-decane,
C; respectively. The DO values are indicated at the top of the ﬁgures. The vertical dotted line in Figs. 10 to 12 separate
35 the GB experiments (DO < 1 mm) from the ISS experiments (DO > 1mm). The scale factors are indicated at the
(3 bottom of the ﬁgures. The images along any column show the burning history of droplets for the indicated D0. The
3 time stamps correspond to the time of the image in the burning history. The two needle-like glows on opposite sides
E of the GB images are the result of the ﬁber passing through the ﬂame.
Q As shown in the Fig. 10 (heptane) the ﬂame intensity (mainly due to soot incandescence) for DO < 1 mm clearly
2? increases with increasing droplet diameter, which suggests enhanced soot formation as DO increases in this range.
2. The trend is most likely due to a longer residence time of fuel molecules for transport between the droplet and ﬂame.
§ 188 experiments (DO > 1 mm) show an opposite trend. With increasing DO soot incandescence appears to
Li decrease as DO increases. With this decreasing luminosity, an extinction phenomenon was observed as signiﬁed by
E the disappearance of the ﬂame that was never observed for the DO < 1mm experimental conditions. The precise
Q mechanism of this extinction process is speculative. This effect is most likely the result of radiative losses from the

ﬂame for the large droplets which does not exert a signiﬁcant inﬂuence on burning for smaller droplets. As a result,

for small droplets other factors control soot formation (and ﬂame luminosity) such as the residence time of fuel

molecules13 .

The ﬂame extinction noted in Figs. 10 to 12 may be due to either a diffusive or radiative inﬂuence. The former
appears to be prevalent, if it occurs at all, for ""small"" droplets (DO < 1 mm). The mechanism would be an
evaporation rate that is too slow to maintain the ﬂame. For the large droplets typical of the sizes employed in the
188, a radiative extinction process would be triggered by excessive radiation loss from the ﬂame boundary which,
again, cannot sustain combustion39’45’46’64.

Precisely what characteristics of the experiment provide a deﬁnitive assessment of the type of extinction is
unclear, though the rate at which the ﬂame disappears appears to be prominent”. For diffusive extinction the ﬂame
quickly disappears as the evaporation rate becomes unable to sustain combustion. For radiative extinction, the ﬂame
extinction process seems to be slow with the ﬂame gradually disappearing. This comparatively slow process is

Figure 13. Collection of soot and droplet images from the BW cameras for both ISS and GB n-decane
experiments.

From BW images like those shown in Figs. 13 to 15, quantitative measurements of D and Ds were obtained. The
evolution of D2 for octane in particular is shown in Fig. 16 at the indicated value of D0. The slope of each curve is
the burning rate, K (mm2/s). Also shown is the evolution of D2 for pure evaporation (i.e., n0 combustion). The much
slower evaporation rate is evident.

"14","The GB data in Fig. 16a show virtually no inﬂuence of D0. The large droplet data (16b), however, suggest that
the burning rate decreases with increasing D0 which is consistent with reduced sooting as DO increases as noted in
connection with Figs. 10 to 12. This trend is likely associated with radiative losses that reduce sooting such that the
temperature may be reduced sufﬁciently that it is below the soot inception temperature65. For DO < 1 mm, radiative
extinction-like processes were not observed for any of the GB experiments.

The quantitative measurements in Fig. 16 provide another indication of extinction: the burning rate rather
noticeably decreases at some time during the burning history. The marked time in Fig. 16 corresponds to the
disappearance of the ﬂame discerned from the color images which is faintly noticed in Fig. 11. Thereafter, the
burning rate is nearly linear with a lower rate.

g Close examination of Fig. 16 shows that the burning rate is time-dependent — due to unsteady heating that
E persists throughout the burning process. As such, a single burning rate does not adequately characterize the entire
a droplet burning history for these data. To clarify the inﬂuence of DO 011 the burning rate, the burning process was
E divided into four zones as marked by the vertical dotted lines in Figs. 17a to 19a. In each zone the D2 proﬁles were
<2 linearized to obtain the trends shown in Figs. 17-19 b,c,d,e. The black dotted curves in these ﬁgures are trend 1ines.
(<1) The burning rates decreases with increasing DO across the spectrum of droplet diameters investigated. This trend
% is consistent with reduced soot formation as DO increases. The mechanism for this reduction appears to be increasing
é radiative losses as DO increase, that in some cases eventually leads to radiative extinction noted previously. For the
E three alkanes investigated it appears that regime I in Fig. 2 corresponds approximately to D01 ~ 1 mm, and in this
3 range K does appear to exhibit an asymptotic trend which is consistent with the scaling arguments discussed
2 previously (Appendix A). The experimental results suggest that though soot formation is enhanced due to a larger
E. tres for DO > 1 mm, radiative heat losses appear to overwhelmingly lower the ﬂame temperature (hence inhibiting
g soot formation and reducing heat transfer to the droplet), leading to a decrease of burning rate with increasing D0.
g A time is noted in Figs. 17a—19a at which the evolution of D2 noticeably changes. This effect is believed to be
5 due to the previously mentioned radiative extinction phenomena. In fact, the ﬂame has not completely disappeared
D but only that the imaging diagnostics are insufﬁcient to reveal the chemiluminescence 0f the faint ﬂame that may in

fact still be present. The post-radiative extinction zone is not predictable by high temperature (~ 2000K) combustion

kinetics. Rather, it appears to be controlled by low temperature (< 700-800 K59) combustion kinetics. This regime is

the “cool ﬂame” regime noted previous1y46'48.

Figures 20 to 22 show the evolutions of ﬂame standoff ratios (FSR E Df/D) for heptane, octane and decane,
respectively. Twenty data points are presented for each ISS experiment in Figs. 20a to 22a while all GB ﬂame
images are measured and shown in Fig. 20a-22a. In order to examine the DO effect on FSR, the data extracted from
the three sampling 1ines (t/DO2 = 0.4, 0.8, and 1.2 s/mm2, respectively) indicated are shown in Figs. 20b to 22b. The
FSR decreases with increasing DO for DO < 1 mm, while the FSR for DO > 1mm decreases from a larger value than
for D0 = 0.85 mm. not clear; The black dotted lines indicate a “three-stage” trend for FSR at t/DO2 = 0.8 s/mm2. This
suggested trend is also applicable for the data with t/DO2 = 0.4 and 1.2 s/mm2 in Fig. 21b. This “three-stage” trend in
the plot of FSR vs. DO seems to be found for all three alkane investigated.

Figure 23 schematically illustrates the observed “three-stage” variations shown in Figs. 20b to 22b. in the FSR
vs. DO graphs for the fuel examined in this study, With the three stages labeled as I, II, and III (stage I represents the
region Where FSRs decrease With increasing DO; stage II is the increasing FSR region; stage III is the other region
Where FSRs also decrease With increasing D0). Combining the observations for soot formation and radiative heat
losses from all the results in the present study, we attempt to provide explanations for this “three-stage” behavior of
FSR. In stage I, the FSR values are greatly affected by soot formation. The decrease of FSR observed in this stage is
due to the enhanced soot formation When DO increases in this small DO region (also observed in Fig. 11 for n-
octane). The larger tres With negligible radiative heat losses to the surroundings cause fuel molecules to convert to

soot particles that could potentially reduce the effective d1ffus10n coefﬁment 1n the gas phase . The reduction of the
diffusion coefﬁcient would lower the fuel diffusion rate, thus causing the ﬂame to retreat (i.e. to produce a smaller
FSR).

"19","Figure 25 shows the evolution of soot standoff ratio, SSR E DS/D, for n—octane With the DS and D measured from
the BW images. The results suggest that SSR of n—octane increases With increasing D0. Similar trends are also found
for n—decane and n—heptane (not shown here).

For all the fuels examined in this study, radiative extinction occurs When DO reaches a certain value (usually
above 3 mm, depending on the fuel). A spherical droplet ﬂame usually extinguishes from one “point” on the ﬂame
shell. Then the ﬂame boundary moves towards the opposite point on the shell until the entire ﬂame disappears. For
sooting fuels tested in this study, this extinction process is initiated due to the presence of soot aggregates. Figure
26a shows consecutive images (recorded at 30 fps) for such a transient process of radiative extinction. As shown, the
bright “tail” at ﬁve o’clock inside the ﬂame is the soot aggregates making contact With the ﬂame. This contact
affects the local heat transfer because soot aggregates act like a heat sink With a higher thermal conductivity than the
ambient inside the ﬂame. So the unevenly distributed heat from the ﬂame sheet triggers the extinction from that
particular angle (ﬁve o’clock).

2 correspond to the photographs shown in (a) and (b).

E For non—sooty fuel, the ﬂame would just completely extinguish once the ﬂame shell is open. On the contrary, due

2;: to the presence of the “hot” soot aggregates produced by sooty fuels, the extinguishing ﬂame can grow back to the

3 position Where the extinction is triggered. Figure 26b shows such a process. And, once the close—back ﬂame touch

§ the soot aggregates, the ﬂame open up again (of. Fig. 26a).

g The reciprocal ﬂame extinction process assembles the motion of a “jellyﬁsh.” This “jellyﬁsh” motion can be

E manifested by showing the evolution of ﬂame angle (how much the Visible ﬂame occupies a sphere; a full spherical
ﬂame: 360°; no ﬂame: 0°) before the ﬂame completely disappears. Figure 260 shows such a graph for n—decane and
n—heptane experiments in Which more than one jelly ﬁsh motion is observed in a radiative extinction event. The inset
to Fig. 260 shows how the ﬂame angle is deﬁned and measured. The black square data in Fig. 260 show that a n—
decane droplet ﬂame (D0 = 5.1 mm) experiences three reciprocal jellyﬁsh motion, With a larger ﬂame opening in
each time, until the fourth open—up motion Where the ﬂame completely extinguishes. The “a” and “b” inserted in

data (n—heptane, D0 = 3.55 mm), only one complete cycle of jellyﬁsh motion is seen before the ﬂame completely

3 As mentioned earlier, radiative extinction changes the slope of the D2 curve. Figure 27a shows the D2 data from
§ two n-heptane experiments that exhibit three various regions (recognized by their very different slopes) in their
8“ burning histories: Visible ﬂame region; cool ﬂame region; and post cool ﬂame region (as illustrated by Fig. 27b). It
g is because of n-heptane’s higher burning rate that the third slope region can be capture Within the limited data
5 storage on ISS for an experiment. The boundary between earlier two regions shown in Fig. 27b is radiative
E extinction for Which the mechanisms are provided along the discussions. We speculate that the second slope change
E found at the end of D2 data is attributed to “cool ﬂame extinction” Where the low temperature oxidation kinetics are
é no longer sustained due to continuing heat dissipation. This slope change is only obvious in D2 data. There is no
(L3 signiﬁcant difference (not in the Visible light range) found in both BW and color images at the instant of slope
é change.

a V. Conclusions
9 Experimental data of n-ocane, n-decane, and n-heptane droplet ﬂames With spherical symmetry over a Wide
i range of initial droplet diameters provide better understanding for the dimension effects on the combustion physics.
i These dimension effects are attributed to the interplay of soot formation and radiative heat losses With different DO
g ranges. Main ﬁndings in the present study are itemized as follows:
E l. The D2 evolution along the burning histories of n-octane, n-decane, and n-heptane is signiﬁcantly
E dependent on Do, With the burning rate (the slope of the D2 curve) decreasing With increasing Do. This
9 is to be contrast to the prediction from the classical droplet combustion theory With burning rate being
a constant for all DO and time.

2. Radiative extinction signiﬁed by the disappearance of the Visible ﬂame and the slope change of the D2
curve is found for droplets larger than 3 mm. Followed by the radiative extinction, a post-extinction
region that has a droplet evaporation rate larger than that for pure evaporation suggest low temperature
kinetics occurring in the period.

3. Results suggest that the FSR increases throughout the burning history. A “three-stage” behavior is
found on the plot of FSR vs. Do. This “three-stage” curve is attributed to subtle variation of soot
formation (and thus the effective diffusion coefﬁcient in the gas phase) due to the interplay of fuel
residence time tres and radiative heat losses in various DO ranges.

4. Results suggest that SSR also increase over the burning history. SSR values increase With increasing
DO due to weakening thermophoresis caused by radiative heat losses.

"
"21","5. A reciprocal “jellyﬁsh-like” ﬂame motion is recognized in the transient process of radiative extinction.
This jellyﬁsh motion is triggered by the presence of soot aggregates being a heat sink to locally cool
down the ﬂame, and a heat source that assist ﬂame propagation in a cycle of a jellyﬁsh motion.
6. DO effects on the extinction time and extinction droplet diameter are also observed. Results suggest that
larger droplets extinguish earlier with a larger droplet diameter.
7. D2 data from n-heptane reveal that after radiative extinction, there is another slope change point near
the end signifying the extinction of the “cool ﬂame.”
Appendix A
Scaling arguments are used to provide trends for how the droplet burning rate may be expected to depend on
droplet diameter. We will assume radiation from the ﬂame (Q) is mainly a loss mechanism to the ambience, with
essentially no radiative contribution from the ﬂame to the droplet3 1. Flame extinction may be important for
a sufﬁciently large droplets45 with large ﬂame diameters that experience high radiative losses, but this effect is not
§ considered in this scaling exercise. We will assume an optically thin gas and that the characteristic droplet
El dimension is the initial droplet diameter, D0.
g Equation (2) will be a starting point. In terms of scaling we can write that
v
a D
s K ~ pg—g (Al)
5 pL
E The classical theory is not generally applicable as noted previously. However, we believe that the essential
‘03:) properties on which the burning rate depends is still captured by eq. A1. As such, any variation of K with droplet

:5 previously shown“. We are mainly interested in developing a scaling between burning rate and droplet diameter for
Lg the spherically symmetric base case, and the present approach should be useful for that purpose.

Figure A1. Schematic of energy budget for the droplet ﬂame conﬁguration. Radiation (Qr) is only
from the ﬂame to the ambience. Conduction transport from the ﬂame to the droplet (Qi)
evaporates the fuel at the droplet surface that results in a fuel ﬂow rate to the ﬂame Which is
converted to heat by the reaction process.

and ambience as a semi-inﬂnite surface at temperature Tf. With a characteristic time scale as the droplet burning
