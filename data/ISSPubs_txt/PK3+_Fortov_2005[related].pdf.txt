1. Introduction

“Dusty”, or “complex” plasmas are plasma containing solid or liquid particles (dust) which are charged. The charges
can be negative or positive, depending on the charging mechanisms Operating in the plasmas. Dust and dusty plasmas
are quite natural in space. They are present in planetary rings, comet tails, interplanetary and interstellar clouds [1—3],
found in the vicinity of artiﬁcial satellites and space stations [4,5], etc. Also, dusty plasmas are actively investigated
in laboratories. Currently, the term “complex plasmas” is widely used in the literature to distinguish dusty plasmas
specially “designed” for such investigations.

The presence of massive charged particles in complex plasmas is essential for the collective processes. Ensembles 0f
microparticles give rise to new very-low-frequency wave modes which represent the oscillations Ofparticles against the
quasiequilibrium background of electrons and ions. Overall dynamical time scales associated with the dust component
are in the range 10—100 Hz. The particles themselves are large enough to be Visualized individually and, hence, their
motion can be easily tracked. This makes it possible to investigate phenomena occurring in complex plasmas at the
most fundamental kinetic level.

Micron size particles embedded in a plasma do not only change the charge composition, they also introduce new
physical processes into the system, e.g., effects associated with dissipation and plasma recombination 0n the particle
surface, variation of the particle charges, etc. These processes imply new mechanisms of the energy inﬂux into the
system. Therefore, complex plasmas are a new type of non-Hamiltonian systems with the properties which can be
completely different from those of usual multicomponent plasmas.

Dust plays an exceptionally important role in technological plasma applications, associated with the utilization of
plasma deposition and etching technologies in microelectronics, as well as with production of thin ﬁlms and nanopar-
ticles [6—8]. To control these processes, it is necessary to understand the basic mechanisms determining, e.g., transport
of dust particles, inﬂuence of dust on plasma parameters, etc.

Due to large charges carried by the grains (typically, of the order of thousand elementary charges for a micron-size
particle), the electrostatic energy of the mutual interaction is remarkably high. Hence, the strong electrostatic coupling in
the dust subsystem can be achieved much more easily than in the electron—ion subsystem. In complex plasmas, one can
observe transitions from a disordered gaseous-like phase to a liquid-like phase and the formation of ordered structures
of dust particles—plasma crystals. The ﬁrst experimental observation of the ordered (quasicrystalline) structures of
charged microparticles obtained in a modiﬁed Paul’s trap was reported in 1959 by Wuerker et al. [9]. The possibility of
dust subsystem crystallization in a nonequilibrium gas discharge plasma was predicted by Ikezi in 1986 [10]. The ﬁrst
experimental observations ofordered particle structures were reported in 1994 in rfdischarges [1 1—14]. Later on, plasma
crystals were found in do discharges [15], thermal plasmas at atmospheric pressure [16], and even in nuclear—induced
dusty plasmas [17].

The enormous increase of interest in complex plasmas was triggered in the mid 1990’s, by the laboratory discovery
of plasma crystals. Today, the physics of complex plasmas is a rapidly growing ﬁeld of research, which covers various
fundamental aspects of the plasma physics, hydrodynamics, kinetics ofphase transitions, nonlinear physics, solid states,
as well as the industrial applications, engineering, and astrophysics. More and more research groups throughout the
world have become involved in the ﬁeld, and the number of scientiﬁc publications is growing exponentially. In this
reView, we have made an attempt to provide a balanced and consistent picture of the current status of the ﬁeld, by
covering the latest development in the most important directions of the experimental and theoretical complex plasmas,
and outlined the perspective issues to pursue in future. We decided to omit the discussion of the space and atmospheric

dusty plasmas, chemical plasmas with growing particles, etc. —their properties are so diverse and the whole ﬁeld is so
huge that one cannot span it in the framework of a single reView.

2. Types of experimental complex plasmas

Since the discovery of plasma crystals in 1994, the experimental investigations of complex plasmas have been going
on in dozens 0f1ab0rat0ries throughout the world. In this section we brieﬂy discuss the maj or types of the experimental
setups employed to study various phenomena occurring in complex plasmas.

2.]. Complex plasmas in Ifdischarges
2.1.1. Ground—based experiments

Plasma crystals were discovered in a capacitively coupled 10w-pressure rf discharge in inert gases almost simulta-
neously in several laboratories [11—14]. The schematic of a typical experimental setup [18] is shown in Fig. 1. The
experimental apparatus includes a lower electrode 5—10 cm in diameter capacitively coupled to an rf generator (at
frequency 13.56 MHz) and an upper grounded electrode. The electrodes are placed in a vacuum chamber. Micron-size
dust particles ﬁll a container and can be introduced into the discharge through a metallic grid. The electrode separation
is typically 3—100ni. The particle Visualization is performed with the use of laser illumination. The laser beam is
transformed into a sheet approximately 100 nm thick using a lens and illuminates the particles in the horizontal or
vertical plane. The particles introduced into the discharge become (highly) charged negatively and levitate in the pre-
sheath 0r sheath region above the lower electrode, where the electric force balances the gravity. T0 conﬁne the particles
horizontally, a metallic ring with an inner diameter of 3—6 cm and a height of 1—3 mm is placed on the lower electrode.
Sometimes, instead of a ring, a special curved electrode is used. The light scattered by the particles is recorded by a
Video camera.

Under certain conditions, the particles form ordered structures consisting of several fairly extended horizontal layers.
The number of particles in such crystalline structures can be as high as ~104—105, and the number of layers can vary
from one to a few dozen [19]. Usually the particles assemble themselves into hexagonal structures in each layer.
Vertically, they often settle strictly below each other, forming a cubic lattice between neighbouring layers—the so-
called “vertically aligned” hexagonal lattices. Such an arrangement is believed to be a consequence of ion focusing
downstream from the particles—the wake effect (see Sections 5.2 and 10.3).

For reference, we summarize typical parameters of rf discharges and complex plasmas in laboratory experiments:
Particle sizes are in the range ~1—30 am. The neutral (typically inert) gas pressure ~1—100 Pa. The plasma concentration
in the bulk of a discharge is 716 ~ ni ~ 107—1010 cm‘3, the electron temperature is Te ~ 1—5 eV, and ions are typically
assumed to be in equilibrium with neutrals (usually at room temperature), so that T,- ~ Tn ~ 0.03 eV. The sheath is a
region of a positive space charge where the ion concentration exceeds that of electrons even in the absence of dust. The
ion velocity at the edge of the collisionless sheath satisﬁes the Bohm criterion Mi 2 C1 A E M. For the collisional
sheath, the ion directed velocity can be lower than the velocity of sound, but the ions are still typically superthermal:
Mi 2 vTi. The characteristic spatial scale of the charge screening in the sheath is given by the electron Debye radius 2136,
because fast ions do not contribute substantially to the screening. The interparticle interaction is essentially anisotropic
in this case.

2.1.2. Microgravily experiments

Complex plasmas formed under microgravity conditions have been intensively investigated in rf discharges during
the last few years. A typical sketch of the experimental setup is shown in Fig. 2. The results of the ﬁrst sounding rocket
(TEXUS) experiments (with about 6 min of microgravity) and their qualitative analysis were reported by Morﬁll et a1.
[20]. Currently, the “Plasma Crystal” (PKE-Nefedov) laboratory is in operation onboard the International Space Station
(188), created within the framework of the Russian—German scientiﬁc cooperation program [21]. The major tasks of
the PKE-Nefedov include investigations of dusty plasma crystals, phase transitions, wave phenomena, properties of
boundaries between different plasma regions, etc. in a three-dimensional isotropic dusty plasma at the kinetic level. The
ﬁrst “basic” experiments designed to study the behaviour of the dust component over a broad range of dusty plasma

the plasma chamber from two dispensers mounted in the upper and lower electrodes. The microparticles are illuminated by a thin (about 150 um)
sheet of laser light perpendicular to the electrode system. Slow-speed scanning of the laser into the depth of the plasma chamber is used to measure
the 3D positions of the microparticles.
parameters were performed at the beginning of March 2001. Currently, most of the investigations are in the active phase
or in the stage of data analysis.

The typical static and dynamic behaviour of complex plasmas under microgravity conditions is illustrated in Fig. 3.
The ﬁgure shows the trajectories of microparticles. The dominant features are: (i) a microparticle free “void” in the
centre of the system for most experimental parameters, (ii) a sharp boundary between the void and the complex plasma,
(iii) demixing of complex plasma clouds formed by microparticles of different sizes, (iv) crystalline structures along
the central axis, and (V) torus-shaped vortices in different areas away from the central axis.

The microparticle-free centre between the electrodes—the void—can be explained by the balance of forces acting on
the particles in the discharge (see, e.g., [22—24]). Since the dominant force on earth— gravity—is reduced by orders of
magnitude the weaker forces start playing major role. These forces are the electrostatic force arising from the electric
ﬁeld in the discharge and pointed toward the centre (plasma potential has a maximum in the centre), and the ion drag
force Which pushes particles to the periphery. It is well established that even a relatively small number of particles
is repelled from the centre, suggesting that the void formation is not a collective particle effect. At present, the ion
drag is commonly believed to be the most probable mechanism responsible for the void formation (see, e.g., Ref. [25]
and references therein). The ion drag force and the electrostatic force have different dependencies on the grain size.
This causes demixing of different particle sizes: an equilibrium position of smaller particles is closer to the centre than
that of larger ones. The void can be closed under special experimental conditions. These conditions are neutral gas

pressures below 50Pa and the lowest possible rf—voltages, close to the plasma—off condition. At these parameters the
plasma density is so low and the electric ﬁeld is so weak that the electrostatic force dominates and the particles are
pushed to the centre.
The possible mechanisms responsible for the vortex formation are discussed in Section 8.3.
2.2. Complex plasmas in dc discharges
2.2.1. Ground—based experiments
A dc gas discharge is also Widely used for experimental investigations of complex plasmas [15,26—28]. Usually, a
dc glow discharge is employed, as shown in Fig. 4. The particles are illuminated by a laser light and their positions
are registered by a Video camera. Typically, a neutral gas pressure is in the range ~10—500 Pa and a discharge current
is ~0. 1—10 mA. The ordered structures are usually observed in standing striations of the positive column of the glow
discharge but can also be seen in an electric double layer formed in the transition region between the narrow cathode
part of the positive column and the Wide anode part, or in a specially organized multielectrode system having three or
more electrodes at different potentials, etc. —that is, in the regions Where the vertical electric ﬁeld can be strong enough
to levitate the particles. For these regions, some sheath properties considered above in the context of an if discharge
(e.g., plasma anisotropy, ion drift) are also relevant.

"
"7","VE. Forlov el al. /Physz'cs Reports 42] (2005) I —103 7

In the positive column of a low-pressure discharge, the loss of electron energy in elastic collisions is small and the
electron distribution function is formed under the action of the electric ﬁeld and inelastic collisions. This can lead to
the appearance of striations—regions of spatial periodicity of the plasma parameters with the characteristic scale of an
order of a few centimeters [29—31]. The electron concentration, their energy distribution, and the electric ﬁeld are highly
nonuniform along the striation length. The electric ﬁeld is relatively strong (around 10—15 V/cm at a maximum) at the
head of striation—this region may occupy 25—30% of the total striation length, and relatively weak (around 1 V/cm)
outside this region. The maximum value of the electron concentration is shifted relative to the maximum strength of
the electric ﬁeld in the direction of the anode. The electron energy distribution is essentially bimodal, with the head
of the striation being dominated by the second maximum whose centre lies near the excitation energy of neutral gas
atoms. The centre-to-wall potential difference at the head of the striation reaches 20—30 V. Therefore, an electrostatic
trap is formed, which allows us to levitate particles against gravity (provided the particles are not too heavy).

The complex plasma structures in do glow discharges typically form as follows: after being injected into the plasma
of the positive column, the charged particles fall past their equilibrium position and then, over the course of several
seconds, emerge and form a regular structure which is preserved suﬁciciently long (until the end of observation) provided
that the discharge parameters are unchanged. The simultaneous existence of ordered structures in several neighbouring
striations can be observed, indicating the possibility of forming structures much more extended in the vertical direction
compared to rf discharges. Three-dimensional quasicrystalline structures in a dc discharge were reported for the ﬁrst
time in Ref. [26].

In addition to a glow dc discharge, other types of combined dc discharges can be also employed. For example, a
dusty double plasma device is used for experimental investigations of ion—acoustic waves [32]: The system is separated
into a source and target sections by a mesh grid kept at a ﬂoating potential. The source and target plasma are produced
by the dc discharges between ﬁlaments and magnetic cages (a magnetic ﬁeld is used for the plasma conﬁnement).
The experiments are performed at low pressures, ~10‘2 Pa, which is essential to ensure weak collisional damping of
ion—acoustic waves.

2.2.2. Microgravily experiments

The microgravity experiments with complex plasmas in a dc discharge were performed onboard the “Mir” space
station [33—35]. The major difference between this experimental apparatus and that used for the ground-based eX-
periments (see Fig. 4) was the presence of a two-grid electrode placed between the cathode and the anode. During
the experiments, the electrode was at the ﬂoating potential and prevented negatively charged particles from escaping
to the anode. MicrograVity allowed us to perform experiments with very large (bronze) particles with a mean radius
a 2 65 am.

By analysing the Video images of the complex plasma structure formed near the grid electrode, the static (pair
correlation function) and dynamic (diffusion coefﬁcient) characteristics of the dust particle system were recovered.
Measured pair correlation functions revealed the formation of ordered structures of dust particles of a liquid-like
type (short-range order). Such experiments can provide deeper insight into the physics of charging and interaction of
large particles (a 2 xlDi), a subject relatively poorly studied, mainly because ground-based experiments with such large
particles are typically impossible.

Also, a combination of a do and rf (inductively coupled) discharges—the “Plasma Kristall-4” (PK-4) facility shown
in Fig. 5—is planned to be used in future microgravity experiments [36,37]. The PK-4 setup mainly utilizes a dc
discharge plasma, which can optionally be combined with one or two rf coils installed on the discharge tube. This
offers in particular the capability to perform kinetic studies of a great variety of dynamical phenomena in complex
plasmas, such as laminar shear ﬂows and their transition into the turbulent regime, formation of waves and their
propagation, collision experiments and shock wave generation, cooperative phenomena, etc.

2.3. Other types Ofcomplex plasmas
2.3 .1 . Complex plasmas at cryogenic temperatures

The ﬁrst experiments with cryogenic dusty plasmas at a liquid-nitrogen temperatures (77 K) were performed recently

in do glow discharge and capacitively coupled rf discharge [38,39]. Dust structures were formed with MgO particles

discharge is operated in a U-shaped glass tube with a radius of 1.5 cm ﬁlled with neon gas at pressures 20—200 Pa. The complex plasma is formed
by injecting spherical particles into the discharge.
(3—5 am in diameter) and observed in striations 0f the positive column of a dc glow discharge in a quartz discharge
tube (2 cm in diameter) immersed vertically into a cryostat ﬁlled with liquid nitrogen. The capacitive rf discharge was
ignited between two copper—foil rings mounted 4 cm from each other outside the tube. Air at pressures below lOPa
served as a plasma-forniing gas.

In experiments with de plasmas, the whole character of the discharge changes at cryogenic temperatures—Visually,
even the shape of the striations in the glow discharge at 77 K is absolutely different from that seen at room temperature.
Very extended (about 20 em) ordered structures consisting of long chains and occupying practically the whole volume
below the level of liquid nitrogen are formed. The key role in the stability of such structures is played by the longitudinal
thermophoretic force. Strong temperature gradients arise from two sides—from below, at the cathode (because of the
heat release in the cathode zone) and from above, at the boundary of liquid nitrogen. Therefore, the dust structure is
conﬁned in an “electrO-thernial” trap, where the vertical stability is provided by the balance of gravity, the longitudinal
electric ﬁeld, and the thermophoretic forces. The dust structure becomes separated into several parts, each 4—5 cm
long, as the pressure decreases. The resulting structure is, however, unstable with respect to longitudinal low-frequeney
perturbations. This is probably caused by onset of the ion streaming instability (see Section 9.2.2).

In experiments with an rf discharge it was found that at cryogenic temperatures the density of dust particles in
the main volume of the ordered structures can increase considerably. Probably, this is related to the decrease of the
screening radius, which allows the particles to approach closer to each other [3 8,3 9]. In the lower part of dust structures,
the propagation of nonlinear density waves was observed. The dust—acoustic wave velocity in cryogenic conditions
was several times larger than in normal conditions. At lower pressures, the emerging instabilities led to the formation
of multiple horizontal layers with clear boundaries.

2.3.2. T hermal complex plasmas

A thermal plasma is a low—temperature plasma characterized by equal temperatures of the electron, ion, and neutral
components. The existence of liquid or solid srnall—sized particles in such a plasma can signiﬁcantly affect its electro—
physical properties. Effects associated with the presence of particles were observed in early experiments focused on
studying plasrnas of hydrocarbon ﬂames (see, e.g., [40]).

Experimental investigations of the ordered dust structure formation in a thermal plasma were performed in a quasil—
aniinar, weakly ionized plasma ﬂow at temperatures of 1700—2200 K and atmospheric pressure in Refs. [16,41—49]. A
plasma source formed an extended and uniform volume (about 30 cm3) of quasineutral thermal plasma, where the par—
ticles 0f CeOz were introduced. The main plasma components were the charged particles, electrons, and singly charged
Na+ ions. The electron density varied in the range 109—10120rn_3. The dust particles were charged by background
electron and ion ﬂuxes and Via thermionic emission. The latter mechanism played the dominant role and therefore the
particle were charged positively, up to 102—103 elementary charges.

2.3.3. Nuclear—induced and track complex plasmas

Nuclear—induced plasmas are produced by nuclear—reaction products which, passing through a medium, create
ion—electron pairs as well as excite atoms and molecules in their tracks. The experiments were performed in an
ionization chamber which is placed in a hermetical transparent cell [17]. Either ﬁ-particles (decay products of 141Ce) or
oc-particles and ﬁssion fragments (decay products of 252Cf ) were used as ionizing particles [17,50]. In terms of physical
characteristics, the nuclear—induced plasma of inert gases is very different from thermal and gas discharge plasmas.
Because of enormous spatial and temporal inhomogeneities of the plasma density, the charge of each indiVidual particle
changes substantially whenever it crosses the electron or the ion clouds, so that the average charge is derived from the
statistical treatment of these events [17,50].

Recently, experimental investigations of the track complex plasmas produced by proton beams were performed
[51,52]. The motion of Ce02 grains arranged in compact vortex structures was observed. The collective behaviour of
dust particles was found to depend critically on the strength of the external electric ﬁeld.

3. Charging of particles in complex plasmas

The particle charge is one of the most important parameters of complex plasmas. It determines the particle interactions
with plasma electrons and ions, with electromagnetic ﬁelds, between the particles themselves, etc. Hence all studies of
complex plasmas necessarily begin with a model for the particle charge. This section presents an overview of recent
achievements in the understanding of particle charging in plasmas. We mostly focus on gas-discharge plasmas, where
the charging is due to the collection of electrons and ions from the plasma, so that the charge is determined by the
competition between the electron and ion ﬂuxes on the particle surface. Other processes which can also affect charging
(e.g., secondary, thermionic and photoelectric emission of electrons from the particle surface) are discussed only brieﬂy.
We address problems such as stationary particle charge, kinetics of the charging, the effect of ion—neutral collisions,
the self—consistent effect of the presence of dust, and the charge ﬂuctuations. Theoretical results are complemented by
the available experimental data.

3.]. Charging in isotropic (bulk) plasmas

In the absence of emission processes, the charge of a dust particle immersed in a plasma of electrons and ions is
negative. This is because the electrons have higher velocities, so that the electron thermal ﬂux exceeds considerably
that of the ions. The emerging negative charge on the particle leads to the repulsion of the electrons and the attraction
of the ions. The absolute magnitude of the charge grows until the electron and ion ﬂuxes on the particle surface are
balanced. On longer timescales, the charge is practically constant and experiences only small ﬂuctuations around its
equilibrium value, as described in Section 3.5.

The stationary surface potential of the dust particle gas is determined by the electron temperature Te, Viz. gas ~ — Te /e.
Physically, this is because in the stationary state most of the electrons have to be reﬂected by the potential barrier between
the particle surface and surrounding plasma in order for the electron and ion ﬂuxes to balance each other. The coefﬁcient
depends on the particular regime which is realized for the electron and ion ﬂuxes to the particle surface.

One of the most frequently used approaches to describe the electron and ion ﬂuxes collected by the particle is
the orbital motion limited (OML) approximation [53—55]. This approach deals with collisionless electron and ion
trajectories in the Vicinity of a small indiVidual probe (dust particle) and allows the determination of the collection
cross sections from the conservation of energy and angular momentum. We will derive these cross sections in Section
3.1.2. To clarify some of the assumptions underlying the OML approach we ﬁrst brieﬂy discuss the properties of particle
motion in the central ﬁeld.

3.1.1. Motion ofa particle in the central ﬁeld

For a particle moving ballistically in central ﬁeld U (r), the total energy, 6 = % m(v3 —|— vg) —|— U (r), and the angular
momentum, m pv, are conserved. Here m is the particle mass, ,0 is the impact parameter, vr and 129 are the radial and
tangential velocities, respectively, and v is the velocity at r —> 00. It follows from the conservation laws that the radial

motion of particle is fully determined by the eﬂective potential energy,

Where Ueff is normalized to the initial kinetic energy, (f = %mv2. The particle motion is restricted to the region Where
Ueff g 1. This means that if for a given ,0 an equation
UeffO”, p) = 1 (2)
has root(s) then the largest of them determines the distance of the closest approach to the centre, m. For a spherical
centre of radius a, the particle is collected when r0 < a, Whilst for m > a it experiences elastic scattering by the centre
potential, but does not reach its surface.
For a repulsive potential, U (r) > 0, the effective potential is a positive, monotonically decreasing function of r.
Therefore, Eq. (2) has one solution. The maximum impact parameter corresponding to particle collection is

For an attractive potential, U (r) < 0, there are several possibilities, depending on the particular behaviour of U (r)
[56]. The extremum values of Ueff(r) are determined from the condition
r3(dU/dr) = mvzp2 . (4)
If |U (r)| decreases everywhere more slowly than 1 /r2, then the left-hand side of Eq. (4) grows monotonically, and
there is only one solution to this equation. This solution corresponds to a minimum in Ueff. Hence Eq. (2) has only one
solution and similarly to (3) we obtain for the maximum impact parameter corresponding to collection
2U (a)
pi<v>=a‘/1 — —2. <5)
mv
On the other hand if | U (r)| decreases slower than 1 / r2 at small r, but decreases faster than 1/ r2 at large r, then Eq. (4)
can have two solutions, and, hence, Ueff has both maximum and minimum. Maximum is determined by the conditions
U e/foM) = 0 and U é}f(rM) < 0. The maximum in Ueff always occurs at larger distances than the minimum.
If Ueff(l""M) 2 1, then Eq. (2) has multiple solutions: Physically, this means that the potential barrier emerges, Which
reﬂects the particle. This is illustrated in Figs. 6 and 7. From Eq. (1) we see that there is a transitional impactpammeter,
2U (I’M)
,0* = 7” M 1 — —2 ,
mv
Which separates particle trajectories in two groups: no barrier for p < p*, but for p > p* the potential barrier emerges
and the particle is reﬂected at r 2 1M. This causes a discontinuity in the dependence of the distance of closest approach
on ,0, see Fig. 7. In the case 1M > a, the particles With p > p* cannot be collected by the centre. Thus Eq. (5) should be
modiﬁed:

3.1.2. Orbit motion limited (OML) approximation

In the OML approach three maj or assumptions are employed: (i) the dust grain is isolated in the sense that other dust
grains do not affect the motion of electrons and ions in its Vicinity; (ii) electrons and ions do not experience collisions
during their approach to the grain; (iii) the barriers in the effective potential are absent. Then the cross sections for
electron and ion collection are determined from the laws of conservation of energy and angular momentum.

The collection cross sections is 7mg, Where ,0C is the maximum impact parameter for the collection. In the OML
approach the latter are given by Eq. (3) for the electrons and by Eq. (5) for the ions. Thus, the (velocity-dependent)
collection cross sections are

where me(,-) is the electron (ion) mass, v denotes the velocity of the electrons and ions relative to the dust particle, the
grain surface potential gas is negative (gas < 0), and the ions are singly charged. An obvious advantage of the OML
approximation is that the cross sections are independent of the plasma potential distribution around the grain. This is,
however, only true When the potential satisﬁes certain conditions, see the preceding section. Limitations to the OML
approach are considered in the next section.

Electron and ion ﬂuxes to the particle surface are determined by the integral of the corresponding cross sections With

Here, 2 is the absolute magnitude of the particle charge, eZ, in units of a Te /€2, and I is the electron-to-ion temperature

particle charge and surface potential are related to each other Via Z 6 = aqas. This “vacuum” relation is usually a good
approximation for small particles (a < xi), Whilst, in principle, there may be some deviations due to strongly nonlinear
screening and/or nonequilibrium distribution of the electrons and ions around the dust particle.
Let us deﬁne the chargingfrequency Qch (inverse charging time) as the relaxation frequency for small deviations of
the charge from the stationary value Z0: Qch = —d(I,- — Ie)/dZ | Zo- Using Eqs. (11) and (12), we obtain

derived in Refs. [58,59] for the simplest system consisting of dust particles and electrons emitted from their surfaces.
The solution of nonlinear Eq. (13) With ﬂuxes from Eqs. (11) and (12) and the initial condition z|t=0 = 0 is shown
in Fig. 8. One can see that the overall time scale of the nonlinear Charging is also determined by Qch.
In the framework of the OML approximation, the dimensionless surface potential Z depends on two parameters—the
electron—to—ion temperature ratio, and the gas type (electron—to—ion mass ratio). In Fig. 9, values of Z are presented for

particle with a ~ 1 um and Te ~ 1 eV, the characteristic charge number is |Z | ~ (1—3) X 103 .
3.1.3. Accuracy of the OML approximation

The assumptions underlying OML theory are seldom met in reality. Below we discuss three major reasons, which
can make the OML approach inapplicable.

The ﬁrst is associated with ﬁnite dust density in experiments and is known as the effect of “closely packed” grains.
This effect is two—fold. The grain component contributes to the quasineutrality condition, making the ion density
larger than the electron density [60]. This increases the ratio of the ion-to-electron ﬂux and hence reduces the absolute
magnitude of the grain charge compared to the case of an individual grain. The strength of the effect can be characterized
by the value of the parameter P = |Z lnd /ne E z(aTe /ez)(nd/ne) (often called “Havnes parameter”), which is the
ratio of the charge residing on the dust component to that on the electron component (nd is the grain number density).
If we simply use expressions (11) and (12) for the electron and ion ﬂuxes together with the quasineutrality condition
ne 2 ni —|— an we get in dimensionless units

me

ﬁGXm—Z) = —(1 + ZT)(1+ P),

mi
The charge tends to that of an individual particle when P < 1, while it is reduced considerably for P > 1. In addition,
when the interparticle separation A is smaller than the characteristic length of interaction between ions (electrons) and
the dust grain, then the ion (electron) trajectories are affected by the presence ofneighbouring particles, thus inﬂuencing
grain charging. Barkan et a1. [61] demonstrated experimentally that the effect of “closely packed” grains can lead to
substantial charge reduction.

The second reason is associated with the fact that OML theory presumes the absence of a barrier in the effective
potential energy. As discussed in Section 3.1.1 the barrier is absent for repulsive interaction (i.e., for the electrons) but
it can emerge when the interaction is attractive (i.e., for the ions). The electrostatic potential around the small absorbing
object in plasmas scales as (X 1 /r close to the object, (X 1/1”2 far from it, and at intermediate distances the potential
decreases faster [56]. Hence, according to the discussion in Section 3.1.1, a barrier in the effective potential can exist
for ions moving towards the grain and some (low energy) ions will be reﬂected from this barrier. This effect leads to a
decrease in the ion current compared to OML theory and, hence, to an increase in |Z |. For a Maxwellian ion velocity

"
"15","VE. Forlov el al. /Physz'cs Reports 42] (2005) I —103 15
distribution there are always suﬂCiciently slow ions, which are reﬂected from the barrier [62]. However, if the fraction
of the ions which are not collected because of the barrier is small then the corrections to OML are also small. Using
Eq. (6) this requirement can be formulated in terms of the ion thermal velocity am < p*(vTi). For the
Yukawa interaction potential with the thermal scattering parameter for the ions Mun.) 2 u(a/xi) > ﬁcr we can write
the condition of the OML applicability in the form [63]

x/Z—zr(a//1)S 1n[zr(a//1)] .
For typical complex plasma parameters z ~ 1 and I ~ 100 we get that OML is applicable for a/xl SJ 0.2. This example
shows that OML works well for sufﬁciently small grains. Essentially the same conclusion is drawn by Kennedy and
Allen [64] from a consistent numerical solution for the surface potential and potential distribution around the probe in
a collisionless plasma.

The third reason is due to ion—neutral collisions. In the OML approach collisions of electrons and ions are neglected
0n the basis that the electron and ion mean free paths Keg) are long compared to the plasma screening length [55].
However, theory has shown that ion—neutral charge-exchange collisions in the vicinity of a small probe or dust grain
can lead to a substantial increase in the ion current to their surfaces even when E,- is larger than xi [65—67]. An increase
of the ion current to a cylindrical Langmuir probe at moderate pressures is also a known effect, which is attributed to
the ion—neutral collisions [68—71]. An increase in the ion current can considerably suppress the grain charge. Recent
experimental results on grain charges in a bulk dc discharge plasma by Ratynskaia et a1. [36] show that the particle charge
can be several times smaller than predicted by the collisionless OML model. We discuss a simple analytical model of
grain charging accounting for ion—neutral collisions and compare its predictions with the available experimental data
on particle charge in the bulk of gas discharges in the next section.

3.1.4. Charging in a weakly collisional regime

Shulz and Brown [72], and then Zakrzewski and Kopiczinski [68] made the following argument for the role of
ion—neutral collisions in the perturbed plasma region (‘sheath’ in their notation) around a probe. They noted that
the collisions in the sheath cause the destruction of the ion orbital motion. When an orbiting ion makes a collision
with an atom in the sheath it will lose energy and be trapped in the region of high negative potential. Such an ion
cannot escape and will eventually reach the probe surface. Especially effective are charge-exchange collisions which
lead to a substitution of the original ion by a low-energy ion created from neutrals. In this case essentially every
charge-exchange collision in the sheath will result in an ion absorption 0n the probe surface, either directly or through
subsequent collisions. Thus, when an average ion experiences not too many collisions in the perturbed plasma region,
the collisions lead to an increase in the ion ﬂux to the probe. On the other hand, when the gas pressure is so high that
ions make many collisions on their way to the probe, then their motion is controlled by mobility. Mobility decreases
with pressure and so does the ion ﬂow. These arguments were used to explain a maximum in the ion current collected
by a negatively biased probe occuring when increasing neutral gas pressure [68,70,71].

To obtain an approximation for the ion current to the particle in the presence of ion—neutral collisions we use the
ideas discussed by Zakrzewski and Kopiczinski [68] and more recently by Zobnin et a1. [65] and Lampe et a1. [67].
First let us deﬁne the relevant (for this particular problem) length scale for the perturbed plasma region, R0. Since the
energy of an ion after a charge-exchange collision is ~Tn ~ Ti, it is convenient to assume that R0 can be determined
from the condition |U (R0)| 2 Tl- , where U (r) denotes the potential energy of ion—particle interaction. For the Yukawa
potential the strength of the perturbation is characterized by the scattering parameter ﬂ [Eq. (7)], evaluated at the ion
thermal velocity, Viz. 6T 2 |Z|ez/ Ti/i E u(a/xi). When ﬁT <1 we have R0 2 |Z|62/ T,- </1. In the opposite limit
(ﬁT > 1) the perturbation region can extend beyond xi substantially.

In this section we consider the weakly collisional regime for the ions, characterized by the condition E,- 2 R0. Beyond
the sphere of radius R0 the plasma density is weakly perturbed, ions have a Maxwellian velocity distribution and their
random ﬂux into the perturbed region is given by

1R0 2 MRgnl-UTZ. .
The probability for an ion to experience a charge-eXChange collision inside the perturbed region can be estimated as
~R0 M,- , provided R0 M,- < 1. After such a collision, the ion is (very likely) trapped by the particle ﬁeld and eventually

"
"16","l6 VE. Forlov el al. /Physz'cs Reports 42] (2005) 1—103
absorbed by the grain. Thus, the net ion ﬂux 0n the grain is simply I,- 2 (1 — RO/Zl-HOML —|— (RO/Zl-HRO [where IOML
is given by Eq. (12)], i.e.,

1,- : MaZnivTi [1 + zr + (Rg/azzin . (16)
This expression was derived by Lampe et al. [67].

Assuming the Yukawa potential around the grain the radius of the perturbed plasma region normalized to the plasma
screening length, R0 //1, is given by the root of the transcendental equation ﬁT eXp(—x) = x. In this case expression (16)
can be further simpliﬁed [73]. The last term in the parentheses in Eq. (16) can be rewritten in the form if ( 6 T )z2 12 (/1 / E,- ),
where if(ﬁT) = (R0 //1)3 ﬁ;2 is a relatively weak function of ﬁT in the range 0.1 f, ﬁT f, 10, with a characteristic value
if ~ 0.1 [73]. Thus we have

1,- : Maznivg [1 + m + 0.1z212(1/12,-)] , (17)
Note, that in this approximation 2 depends on t and x1 / Z ,- , but is independent of the ratio a //1. From Eq. (17) we can see
that the contribution to the charging ﬂux due to ion—neutral collisions is dominant when Z,- S, 0.1zt/l. Thus, for typical
dusty plasma parameters z ~ 1 and I ~ 100 collisions can affect particle charging even when the mean free path is an
order of magnitude larger than the screening length.

Let us check the predictions of this simple analytical approximation for particle charge against available experimental
results and numerical simulations.

Recently experimental results on grain charges in a bulk dc discharge plasma extending over a wide range of neutral
gas pressures were reported [36,73]. The experiment was performed with the PK-4 facility (see Section 2.2) in ground-
based conditions. It uses horizontally oriented tube ﬁlled with neon gas at pressures 20—150 Pa and particles of radii
a 2 0.6, 1.0 11m, and a 2 1.3 nm. For these particle sizes the weak ambipolar radial electric ﬁeld in the bulk plasma
is suﬁcicient to compensate against gravity so that the grains can leVitate in an isotropic plasma near the tube aXis.

The dynamics of particles of different size is studied varying the neutral gas pressure p and the number of injected
particles (controlled by settings of the particle dispenser), which allows us to change the particle number density nd
inside the tube. For a sufﬁciently low number of injected particles the ﬂow is stable for all pressures studied. The ﬂow
is recorded for a number of different pressures. The charge can then be estimated from the force balance condition
using the measured particle velocities. The most important forces are the electric force, the neutral drag force, and the
ion drag force. For the ion drag force the model [74] is used. For a larger number of injected particles (and larger nd)
an easily identiﬁable transition to unstable ﬂow (with a clear wave behaviour) occurs at a certain threshold pressure 19* ,
which can be found experimentally with an accuracy of about 1 Pa [36,75]. This transition is a manifestation of the ion
streaming instability, caused by the relative drift between the dust and the ion components. The value of [9* depends
on nd (shifting towards higher pressures when nd is increased). In this case the charge can be estimated from a linear
dispersion relation describing the transition of the particle ﬂow to the unstable regime at p... The applicability of the
linear dispersion relation method is, however, limited due to nonnegligible effect of particles on plasma parameters
at large particle column densities aznd [73]. In practice this method is used only for smallest grains and low particle
densities. The charges determined from this experiment are shown in Fig. 10 by open symbols.

Two experiments reporting estimates for the particle charge have been performed under microgravity conditions
with the use of the PKE-Nefedov facility [21] (see Section 2.1). It is possible to excite the waves in the particle cloud
by applying a low-frequency modulation voltage to the electrodes. The charge can then be estimated by comparing
the measured dispersion relations with the theoretical ones. In this way the dimensionless charge was found to be
z ~ 0.4 (at p 2 25 Pa argon gas pressure) [76] and z ~ 0.8 (at p 2 12 Pa argon gas pressure) [77]. The results of these
experiments are shown in Fig. 10 by solid circle and square, respectively.

Another experimental method to determine the particle charge reported recently is based on gravity-driven heavy
“test” particle collisions with smaller particles levitating in the quasiisotropic region of an inductively coupled rf
discharge plasma [78]. A heavy particle falls down in a vertical glass tube and interacts with the cloud of small particles
suspended in the diffuse edge of the discharge. The interaction process is recorded with a high-speed Video camera
and individual elastic “collisions” are analysed. Assuming the Debye—Hﬁckel potential around each particle both the
particle charge and effective screening length can be estimated. In Ref. [78] the particle charge is estimated for three
different pressures of neon gas (20, 30, and 50 Pa). The results are shown in Fig. 10 by solid triangles.

A self—consistent molecular dynamics (MD) simulation of micron-size particle charging in a low-pressure plasma
was reported by Zobnin et al. [65]. It was shown that charge-exchange ion—neutral collisions signiﬁcantly affected

These analytical calculations are done for plasma conditions relevant to experiment [73]: neon plasma with T6 = 7 eV and T,- = 0.03 eV.
(reduced) the charge already at pressures corresponding to a ion mean free path considerably larger than the Debye
length. Later on this code was applied to calculate the charges in conditions similar to those of experiments [36,73].
Some modiﬁcations were made to the code to include the effects of ﬁnite particle number density. The charges obtained
using this modiﬁed code were smaller than those obtained with the original code for an isolated particle. This was
apparently caused by an increase in the ion density compared to the electron density (effect of “closely packed” grains).
However, the difference was not very signiﬁcant(usua11y1ess than 10%) for the conditions investigated, i.e., the effect
of ion—neutral collisions was dominant under this parameter regime.

Fig. 10 summarizes the results of different experiments and MD simulations for the grain charge. (It is assumed
here that the effective plasma screening length is xi 2 AD 2 AD,- for the conditions investigated.) It demonstrates
reasonable agreement between the results of different experiments, although they were performed under completely
different plasma conditions (e.g., different types of discharges, different gases, different particle sizes, and different
plasma parameters). This indicates that the ion collisionality index x1 / Z,- is one of the most important parameters, which
controls the particle charge in isotropic dusty plasmas. The experimental uncertainties in charges (not shown in the
ﬁgure) are due to uncertainties in plasma parameters and simpliﬁcation in theoretical models employed to estimate the
charge. They are different in different experiments. For example, in Ref. [73] the uncertainties in Z are ~60% at lowest
pressures and ~30% at higher pressures. In addition, it was noted that the experimental results at low pressures can
contain systematic errors due to the Violation of some simplifying assumptions used in the theoretical models. Strictly
speaking, for the described experiments one cannot expect the accuracy better than ~30% in both Z and x1 / Ki. Taken
this into account, the results of numerical simulations are in good agreement with the experimental results.

Fig. 10 shows that the obtained charges are much smaller than the collisionless OML theory predicts (dotted line). At
the same time a simple analytical approximation of Eq. (17) provides a reasonable ﬁt for the available experimental and
numerical data (solid line), especially taking into account experimental errors. In the parameter regime investigated the
dimensionless charge decreases with the ion collisionality parameter, in agreement with Eq. (17). Note, however, that
for sufﬁciently large ion collisionality (Ro/Zi 2, 1) the assumptions used in deriving Eq. (17) are no longer satisﬁed.
At R0 M,- > 1 a transition to the mobility-limited (hydrodynamic) regime of ion collection should occur. In this regime
the charge should increase with collisionality [65,79], see next section. This regime is not reached in the experiments
discussed in this section.

Thus, ion—neutral collisions can be the main process affecting and regulating particle charging in the bulk of gas
discharges. All the considered eVidence clearly indicates that for a typical quasiisotropic complex plasma z SJ 1, contrary
to the results of collisionless OML theory.

To conclude this section we note, that ion—neutral collisions can lead to the appearance of “trapped ions”. Trapped
ions are those ions that move in closed orbits around the dust particle. They can affect both the particle charging
and the particle charge screening by the surrounding plasma. Apparently, this effect can be substantial for the almost
collisionless regime for ions (E,- > xi), because the creation and loss rates of trapped ions are both proportional to the
ion—neutral collision frequency. However, this question is not fully understood yet. Hence, we only give reference to
original works [66,67,80,81] where the effect of trapped ions was discussed.

3.1.5. Charging in a strongly collisional regime

When the condition Z,- < R0 is satisﬁed the ion motion to the particle is highly collisional and is controlled by
Inobility. In noble gases the characteristic cross section for ion—neutral collisions am is typically between one and
two orders of magnitude larger than that for electron—neutral collisions O'en. Note that in argon, krypton, and xenon
O'en has a pronounced minimum for the electron energies of about 1 eV, due to the Ramsauer—Townsend effect [82].
Consequently, there is a wide pressure range where the electrons still are collisionless while the ions are not. In the
stationary state we have

Vji = Qli — QLi, ji = niHiE — DiVni ,
where QIi and QLi are the source and loss rates, respectively (e.g., ionization by external sources, chemical reactions,
volume recombination etc.), E is the electric ﬁeld around the grain, and ,ul- and D,- are the mobility and the diffusion
coefﬁcient of the ions, respectively. Except for a region of strong electric ﬁeld around the particle (where the mobility
depends on the electric ﬁeld, see e.g., [83]) the mobility can be assumed constant. The electron distribution around a
negatively charged particle is to a good accuracy given by the Boltzmann relation ne 2 n0 exp(eq0/ Te), where no is
the unperturbed plasma density. The electrostatic potential q0(r) around the particle satisﬁes the Poisson equation

with the following boundary conditions:

90(61) = 905, ni(a) = 0,

90(00) = 0, ni(<><>) = no .
A number of investigations were dedicated to solving such problems (e.g., with different ionization and recombination
mechanisms in the Vicinity of a collecting body, modiﬁcations of boundary conditions, etc.) starting from electric probe
theory to investigation of dust particle charging in different types of plasmas. Solutions have been obtained and their
applicability conditions discussed, for example, in Refs. [84—90]. Below we give some estimates for the simplest case,
when ionization and recombination processes in the Vicinity of particles can be neglected.

The ion ﬂux in the absence of external sources of ionization and recombination is conserved and can be written as

0f the particle is taken into account the charge is screened at ﬁnite distances, which can be, however, much larger than
the Debye radius [90].

Physically, the radius R corresponds to the boundary of the space charge that separates the particle from the quasineu-
tral region. In order to evaluate R one can solve the Poisson equation in the space charge layer. However, no compact
expression can be obtained in general case, even though the integration does not involve any fundamental problems
[83]. For this reason we consider two limiting cases. If the particle is very large a > /1 the sheath is usually thin, and we
can assume R ~ a. In this case we get

10 2 47tan0£ivTi(l + Te/Ti) .
In the opposite limit of very small particle, at < xl, we use the following argument: the electric ﬁeld in the vicinity of
the particle is determined by the “vacuum” Coulomb potential, @(r) 2 Z 6 /r. This potential holds as long as either
of the two “geometrical” terms on the left-hand side of the Poisson (18) are considerably larger than the right-hand
side. In this region ni >ne and, hence, we conclude that the screening does not play a role at least for r S, xlDi ﬁlT/3
(assuming ni = no; also, we suppose that the effective screening length is determined by ions, xi 2 11),). Beyond this
region, the potential tends asymptotically t0 the “partially screened” Coulomb form, @(r) 2 Zeffe/ r. In the “transition
zone”, r ~ xlDi ﬂlT/3, the potential is of the order of ~ﬂ2T/3 T,- and, hence, the density perturbation in this region is small,
provided ﬂT < 1. In this case, the ion ﬂux 0n the particle can be written as

10 2 —47tr2,uin0(Ze/r2) = 47tanoﬁivTi(Te/Ti)z . (21)
Using Eq. (20) and taking into account that Zeff E (Te/e)R, we can evaluate the effective charge: Zeff / Z = z_1 for
large particles and Zeff / Z = (1 —|— T,- / Te)_1 for small particles. We note that an increase of Zeff / Z and saturation at a
value of ~05 when increasing x1 / a was found in Ref. [90], where particle charging in high pressure thermal plasma
(T,- 2 Te) was numerically investigated.

It is noteworthy that radius R should not be in general equal to the radius of the perturbed plasma region R0, introduced
in the preceding section: within R0 the ions are strongly coupled to the particle, but this does not necessarily imply
Violation of quasineutrality at r f, R0.

3.1.6. T ransitions between the charging regimes

Let us identify the conditions when the transitions between different regimes of particle charging occur. For the
electron ﬂux we use the OML expression (11). The expression for the ion ﬂux depends on the ion collisionality:
for collisionless ions we use Eq. (12), for the weakly collisional regime—Eq. (16), and for the strongly collisional
regime—Eq. (21), which are appropriate estimations for small particles (a < xl). The result of calculations for typical
complex plasma parameters and three different values of the ratio /1 / a are shown in Fig. 11. The ﬁgure shows that
the collisionless regime is realized at extremely small /1 / E,- f, 0.01. In this regime the deviation from the OML result
is small. In a typical situation for complex plasmas, xl/Zi f, 1, the charge decreases with collisionality and can be up
to several times smaller than the collisionless OML theory predicts. The transition to the mobility-limited regime of
charging occurs somewhere in the range 1 f, /1 / E,- f, 10, depending 0n /1 / a. The theoretical model for this transitional
regime still needs to be constructed. For very large ion collisionality the charge increases, because collisions reduce
the ion mobility and hence the ion ﬂux. This qualitative dependence of the particle charge on ion collisionality is in
full agreement with the results of numerical simulations reported by Zobnin et al. [65].

3.2. Charging in anisotropic plasmas

Dusty plasmas are usually subject to electric ﬁelds. For example, in ground—based experiments with if discharges the
particles can levitate in the (pre) sheath above the lower electrode, while in do discharges the particles are often trapped
in striations. Both these regions are characterized by high degree of plasma anisotropy and strong electric ﬁelds. The
larger the particle size is, the stronger the electric ﬁeld is required in order to compensate for gravity. The presence
of the electric ﬁelds causes plasma drifts relative to the dust component. This in turn can affect particle charging by
changing the collection cross sections and velocity distribution functions of ions and electrons. The problem of charging
becomes much more complicated than in the case of an isotropic plasma, and we are not aware of any self—consistent
analytical solution.

To get an idea how the plasma drifts can affect particle charging the following simpliﬁcation is usually used. The

Often, the drift of electrons is negligible While the ion drift is large. For example, this occurs in the regime of ambipolar
plasma, in the (pre)sheath regions, i.e., Where the electron distribution is close to Boltzmann, implying that the electric
force acting on the electrons is compensated by the electron pressure. In this case the electron ﬂux to the particle
surface is given by Eq. (11) While for the ions one should use Eq. (23). The resulting dimensionless charge of the dust
particle as a function of the ion drift velocity is shown in Fig. 12 for three values of 716 /n,-. The charge is practically

asymptotic expressions (12) and (25) (the latter are indicated by dotted lines) shows almost no discrepancy, except for
a narrow region near ui ~ 123.

Fig. 12 illustrates the behaviour of the particle charge in a sheath above the electrode in rf/dc discharges. The averaged
electric ﬁeld here increases almost linearly towards the electrode (see, for example, Ref. [93] and references therein).
The ions are accelerated by the electric ﬁeld, which leads to an increase of Z until ui becomes several times larger than
CIA. A positive space charge is developed in the sheath so that ni /ne > 1 as the electrode is approached. This causes
Z to decrease compared to the quasineutral region. Thus, when approaching the electrode from the unperturbed bulk
plasma the dimensionless charge Z ﬁrst somewhat increases, reaches a maximum, and then decreases. The charge can
even reach positive values suiﬁciently close to the electrode. Examples of numerical calculations of the dependence
of the particle surface potential on the distance from the electrode in collisionless and collisional sheaths of if and dc
discharges can be found in Ref. [94] for a set of plasma parameters.

The accuracy ofneglecting the potential anisotropies caused by the ion ﬂow (i.e, the as sumption of the OML collection
cross section) was checked by Lapenta [95] and Hutchinson [96,97] using particle-in-cell codes. It was shown that
the potential asymmetry is Virtually negligible with respect to the total ion ﬂux for a conducting particle. However,
the agreement between simulation and theory is worse for a dielectric particle. The latter acquires a signiﬁcant dipole
moment and the absolute magnitude of the charge of dielectric particle is larger than that of conductive particle. Such
trend was predicted analytically by IVleV et a1. [98]: Fig. 13 shows that the deviation between the charges can be quite
substantial. Another circumstance which can affect the accuracy of expression (23) is the deviation of the ion velocity
distribution function from shifted Maxwellian, see e.g., Eq. (53) and Ref. [99].

Experimental examination of dust particle charges is of extreme importance, especially in cases where the plasma
parameters are unknown or cannot be determined with sufﬁcient accuracy. This is especially the case of anisotropic
plasmas (e.g., sheaths) where in addition to the charging model (already complicated by plasma anisotropy, nonneu-
trality, presence of “superthermal” ions and electrons, etc.), one needs to choose an appropriate model for the sheath,
which is not trivial itself.

Several experimental methods were proposed to measure particle charge in sheath 0r striation regions of discharges.
Some of them are described below.

Vertical resonance method. Characteristics of the vertical oscillations of a single particle in the sheath are determined
by the particle charge (see Section 8). Typical values of the vertical resonance frequency [2V are in the range 1—100 Hz
and, hence, one can use low-frequency excitations to estimate the charge. As a simplest example, we refer to linear
(harmonic) oscillations. By measuring the amplitude of the particle oscillations at different frequencies and then ﬁtting
the obtained frequency response curve with the well-known theoretical expression [100], it is possible to determine the
resonance frequency, 9V and the neutral damping rate vdn simultaneously. This technique was employed for the ﬁrst
time in Ref. [14], and later it was used to determine the particle charge in Refs. [101—105]. The excitation is usually
performed by applying a low-frequeney signal to the rf electrode (in a modiﬁed variant—to a Langmuir probe or a wire
inserted into a plasma in a vicinity of the levitated particle), or by using a focused laser beam.

The main difﬁculty in estimating the particle charge from experimental results is to establish the relation between 9V
and Z. It is often supposed that the dependence of Z on the height is much weaker than that of the electric ﬁeld, i.e., in
the ﬁrst approximation one can assume Z 2 const, and therefore 9‘2, 2 —Z E 6 / md, where E (3 denotes the derivative of
the electric ﬁeld evaluated at the particle equilibrium position. At sufﬁciently high pressures, the value of the derivative
E ’ is practically constant over the sheath and can be estimated using a certain theoretical model. (Probe measurements
in the sheath are not reliable, because of uncertainty in their interpretation.) This introduces some inaccuracy in the
measurement results. Nevertheless, this method is often used in experiments because of its particular simplicity.

Vertical equilibrium. The method is based on the fact that when the potential distribution in the sheath is suitably
determined, the charge on isolated dust particles levitated in the sheath can be estimated from their equilibrium heights
by using balance between gravity and electric force. The method was used by Tomme et a1. [93] and later by Samarian
and Vladimirov [106]. In this method care must be taken in choosing an appropriate model for the sheath. Another
possible source ofuncertainties is the effect offorces that are not taken into account (e.g., ion drag, thermophoresis, etc.)

Dust lattice waves. Excitation of dust waves in strongly ordered particle structures (e.g., particle chains or two-
dimensional lattices) is often employed as a diagnostic tool in studying dusty plasmas. The dispersion relations of the
dust—lattice waves can be derived assuming certain form of the interparticle interaction potential (see Section 9.4).
Usually the Yukawa potential is used. In this case the main parameters entering into the dispersion relation are the
particle charge Z, and the ratio of the interparticle distance to the effective screening length—the lattice parameter
K = 41/1. Other parameters are either known in advance (e.g., particle mass) or can be easily determined in the
experiment (e.g., interparticle distance). Hence, Z and K can be estimated by comparing an experimental dispersion
relation with a relevant theoretical model. The dispersion relations measured in Refs. [107—1 1 1] were used to estimate the
particle charge.

Other methods of charge determination were also used. In the collision method proposed by Konopka et al. [18]
two-particle collisions are produced in a sheath region of an rf discharge using a horizontal electric probe, which
allows to manipulate the particles. The form of the interaction potential is reconstructed from the analysis of particle
trajectories. It was found that for low discharge powers and pressures the interaction potential can be ﬁtted with the
Yukawa potential within experimental uncertainties. From the ﬁt the effective particle charge and plasma screening
length can be estimated.

Measurements of the particle charge in a stratiﬁed dc discharge plasma were performed by Fortov et al. [1 12]. In this
work, aperiodic oscillations of an isolated particle were excited by a focused laser beam. Analysis of particle trajectory
yielded the charge.

A nonlinear dependence of the particle charge on the particle size was evidenced in experiments in anisotropic
plasmas (see e.g., Refs. [93,106,112]). This nonlinear dependence can be attributed to the dependence of surrounding
plasma parameters on particle size [113]: the particles with different radii levitate in different regions of the sheath
or striation characterized by different plasma parameters, i.e., different ion and electron densities, ion drift velocity,
electron temperature, etc. This makes the particle surface potential dependent on particle size and thus causes a nonlinear
dependence of the particle charge on size, in contrast to the charging in the bulk of gas discharges.

The effect of ion—neutral collisions on particle charging, discussed in detail in connection with charging in isotropic
plasmas, can apparently be also important in anisotropic plasmas. In this case the effect is two-fold: in addition to
destroying collisionless ion trajectories in the Vicinity of the particle, collisions change the structure of the sheath or
striation. Thus the charge can depend on the ion collisionality in a quite complicated way and we are not aware of
any consistent theoretical study of this effect. We note in this context an experiment of Fortov et al. [112] where some
increase of the particle surface potential with pressure was reported.

3.3. Other eﬁ’ects importantfor particle charging

The collection of ions and electrons from the plasma is not the only possible charging mechanism. Electrons can
also be emitted from the particle surface due to thermionic, photoelectric, and secondary electron emission processes.
These processes are of importance for dust charging in the working body of solid-fuel MHD generators and rocket
engines [40,1 14—1 16], in the upper atmosphere, in space [4,1 17,1 18], and in some laboratory experiments, for instance,
in thermal plasmas [16,41—49] or in plasmas induced by UV irradiation [119], with photoelectric charging of dust
particles [120], charging by electron beams [121], etc. Emission of electrons increases the dust particle charge and,
under certain conditions, the particles can reach a positive charge, in contrast to the situation discussed previously. Due
to the emission processes two-component systems consisting of dust particles and the electrons emitted by them can in
principle exist. In this case, the equilibrium potential (charge) of the dust particle is determined by the balance of the
ﬂuxes that are collected by the particle surface and emitted from it, so that the quasineutrality condition is Z nd 2 ne.
Such a system serves as the simplest model for investigating different processes associated with emission charging of
dust particles [40,58,114]. Let us brieﬂy consider each of the emission processes listed above.

T hermiom'c emission. For an equilibrium plasma characterized by a temperature T , it is common to use the following
expressions for the ﬂux of thermoelectrons [115]:

th h3 p T (1+?)exp(—%), gps>0.

"24","24 VE. Forlov el al. /Physz'cs Reports 421 (2005) 1—103

Values of the work function W of thermoelectrons for different metals and semiconductors 1ie typically within the
ranges from 2 t0 5 eV. In the case of dielectric particles, where free electrons appear due to ionization, thermionic
emission cannot play a signiﬁcant role because the particles usually melt before thermionic emission makes a substantial
contribution to the electron ﬂux. For negatively charged particles its electric ﬁeld accelerates the electrons from the
particle surface and some increase in emission current can be expected due to reduction of the work function by the
Schottky effect. Therniionic emission was identiﬁed as the dominant charging mechanism in thermal plasmas (see
Section 2.3).

Photoelectric emission. The electron emission can be caused by an incident ﬂux of photons with energies exceeding
the work function of photoelectrons from the particle surface [122,123]. The characteristic value of the work functions
for most of the materials does not exceed 6 eV, and hence photons with energies g 12 eV can charge dust particles
without ionizing a buffer gas. The ﬂux of emitted electrons can be written as [55,124]:

where J is the photon ﬂux density, and Y is the quantum yield for the particle material. It is also assumed that the radiation
is isotropic, the eﬂciciency of radiation absorption is close to unity, which occurs when the particle size is larger than
the radiation wavelength, and the photoelectrons possess a Maxwellian velocity distribution with the temperature Tpe.
The last of these lies in most cases within the ranges from 1 t0 2 eV. The quantum yield is very low just above the
threshold, but for the most interesting regime of a vacuum ultraviolet it can reach a value of one photoelectron per
several photons. Therefore, the photoelectric emission mechanism of particle charging can be quite important in space.

Sickafoose et al. [120] studied experimentally photoelectric emission charging of dust particles with diameters of
~100 uni. Conducting particles acquired a positive ﬂoating potential and charge both increasing linearly with the
decreasing work function of photoelectrons. Behaviour of dust particles charged by solar radiation in microgravity
conditions was investigated in Refs. [28,119]. An analysis of particle dynamics after UV irradiation, reported in [119],
revealed that the particles with mean radius 37.5 nm were charged to approximately 104 6.

Secondary electron emission. The ﬂux Ise of secondary electrons is connected to that ofpriniary electrons, Ie , through
the secondary emission coeiﬁcient 5, Viz. 156 = 516. The coefﬁcient 5 depends both on the energy 6 ofpriniary electrons
and on the dust particle material. The dependence 5(6) turns out to be practically universal for different materials, if 5 is
normalized to the maximum yield 5m Ofelectrons, and 6 is normalized to the value gm of energy at which this maximum
is reached. The corresponding expressions for the case of monoenergetic electrons can be found in Refs. [4,55]. The
values of the parameters 5m and 6m for some materials given in [4] lie within the ranges: 5m ~ (1—4), and 6m ~
(0.2—0.4) keV. For the case of Maxwellian-distributed electrons, the expression for 5 was given, for instance, in [55].

Walch et al. [121] experimentally investigated the charging of particles of various materials and diameters from 30
to 120 nm by thennal and monoenergetic superthernial electrons. When the charging was dominated by superthernial
electrons, the particles were charged to the potential proportional to the electron energy and the charge proportional to
the particle radius. However, when the electron energy reached a threshold value (different for various materials), from
which the secondary electron emission became important, a sharp decrease in the absolute magnitude of the charge
was found.

3.4. Role ofmicroparticles in plasma charge balance

The dust particles immersed in a plasma act as ionization and recombination centres. Particles that emit electrons
may increase the electron concentration in the plasmas. Conversely, when the particles absorb electrons from the plasma
they become negatively charged and reduce the electron density compared to the ion density. From the quasineutrality
condition it is clear that the presence of dust inﬂuences the plasma charge composition when |Z lnd /ne E P 2 1.

In the absence of emission processes, electrons and ions recombine 0n the dust particles. Plasma loss rates are
determined by the expression QLe(,-) 2 [605%, where leg) is the ﬂux of electrons (ions) absorbed by the dust particle
surface. For large dust concentrations, the losses of electrons and ions on the particles can exceed the recombination
losses in the dust—free plasma (volume recombination and/or plasma losses to the walls of a discharge camera). In
self-sustained plasmas an increase in the recombination frequency has to be compensated for by a corresponding

"
"25","VE. Forlov el al. /Physz'cs Reports 421 (2005) 1—103 25
increase in the ionization frequency [26,125]. This can for instance lead to an increase in the electron temperature and
the discharge electric ﬁeld.

When particles emit electrons, they serve as ionization sources as well. The particle contribution to the ionization is
characterized by the ﬂux of emitted electrons (see the previous section). In the limiting case, emission from particles
embedded into a neutral gas completely determines the charge composition of the plasma, playing the role of sources
and sinks for the electrons.

3.5. F luctuations 0f the particle charge

In the previous sections the particle charge was treated as a continuous regular variable. However, the charging
currents represent in reality sequences of events bound to electron and ion absorption or emission by the dust particle
surface. These sequences and time intervals between the successive acts of absorption and emission are random. As a
result, the particle charge can ﬂuctuate around its average value. The importance of charge ﬂuctuations was recognized
as early as in the 1980s: Morﬁll et al. [126] suggested that charge ﬂuctuations can have a major inﬂuence on dust
transport in astrophysical plasmas. Several studies in recent years addressed the problem of charge ﬂuctuations that
arise from the random nature of the charging process [127—130]. In particular, gas discharge plasmas, where dust is
charged by collecting electrons and ions, were considered within the framework of the OML approach. Several different
charging mechanisms, including thermionic and photoelectronic emission processes, were also considered in Ref. [58].

Charge ﬂuctuations due to discrete nature of charging can be described as a stationary, Gaussian and MarkOVian
process (or the Ornstein—Uhlenbeck process [131]). This process was originally adopted to describe the stochastic
behaviour of the velocity of a Brownian particle. In the above case, it describes the behaviour of the deviation of a
particle charge from its average value: Z1(t) = Z (t) — Z0, where Z0 2 (Z (t)) is the average charge. Let us derive
the main properties of charge ﬂuctuations. For simplicity, we limit consideration to the particle charging by electron
and ion collection in the OML approximation. Generalization to other charging mechanisms is triVial. The LangeVin
equation for Z1(t) is

where f (t) is the stochastic term, associated with random acts of electron/ion collection. Function f (t) satisﬁes the
following properties: (f (t)) = 0 and (f (t) f (t’)) = 2105(1 — t’), where IQ is the ﬂux of electrons and ions to the particle
in the stationary state [which determines the average charge, see Eq. (14)]. Applying these properties to the solution to
Eq. (27),

Usually, it is enough to use these properties for investigating the inﬂuence ofcharge ﬂuctuations on dynamic processes
in dusty plasmas. In particular, the following investigations can be mentioned: dust particle “heating” (in terms of the
kinetic energy) in an external electric ﬁeld due to charge ﬂuctuations was studied in Refs. [132—135]; instabilities of
dust particle oscillations due to charge ﬂuctuations were considered by Morﬁll et al. [136] and IVleV et al. [137], dust
diffusion across a magnetic ﬁeld due to random charge ﬂuctuations was investigated by Khrapak and Morﬁll [138]
with application to astrophysical plasma.

We note that the discreteness 0f the charging process in not the only reason for particle charge ﬂuctuation. Spatial
and temporal variations in plasma parameters, collective effects in dusty plasmas constitute other sources of charge
ﬂuctuations. These issues, however, have been much less investigated.

4. Electrostatic potential around a particle
4.1. Isotropic plasmas

The distribution of the electrostatic potential q0(r) around an isolated spherical particle of charge Z in an isotropic
plasma satisﬁes the Poisson equation (18) with the boundary conditions @(00) = O and @(a) 2 gas. The potential is
connected to the particle charge through the relationship

dgp _ Z 6

dr r=a _ a2 '
In a plasma with a Boltzmann distribution of electrons and ions the right-hand side of Eq. (18) can be linearized,
provided the condition legas/ Teml < 1 is satisﬁed. This yields

where 1132 = 1133 —|— 1131.2 is the linearized Debye length. The surface potential is gas 2 (Z 6 /a)(1 —|— a //1D)_1. For small
particles, a < 113, Eq. (30) is simpliﬁed to

W) = <2e/r) exp<—r/AD> . (31)
Expression (31) is the Debye—Huckel potential which is often used in complex plasmas. If the surface potential is
not small compared to the temperatures of electrons and/or ions, then one can still use Eq. (31) at sufﬁciently large
distances from the particle. In this case, the surface potential gas should be replaced by some effective surface potential
gpeff, with lgpeffl < lgpsl. For given plasma parameters, the value of gpeff can be calculated numerically [139—141].

In fact, however, this simple approach to derive Eq. (31) is not really justiﬁed for most of complex plasmas. First, the
Boltzmann distribution cannot be employed (at least for ions), because usually legos/ T,- | > 1. Second, the Boltzmann
distributions do not represent accurately the actual plasma distribution around the particle, especially for the species
which is attracted to the particle (e.g., ions for a negatively charged particle). Moreover, due to plasma absorption 0n
the particle the electron and ion ﬂuxes directed from the particle are absent (in the absence of emission, of course).
This makes distribution functions of ions and electrons anisotropic in the velocity space. Thus, strictly speaking, there
is no suiﬁcient physical grounds in applying f0nnu1a(31) directly to complex plasmas.

To get an idea what is the realistic form of the particle potential, let us consider a negatively charged perfectly
absorbing particle immersed in a collisionless electron—ion plasma. Assuming that we have Maxwellian plasma in the

"
"27","VE. Forlov el al. /Physz'cs Reports 421 (2005) 1—103 27
unperturbed region far from the particle, the electron (ion) distribution is given by the integral over the corresponding
velocity distribution function,

in the phase space domain, Egg), accessible for electrons (ions), and few 2 0 outside the domain. Three conditions
determine the boundaries of the integration domains E: (i) The total energy (5 should be always positive, (ii) the electron
and ion trajectories satisfying the conditions for absorption end on the particle (i.e., 1),» < 0 for these trajectories), and
(iii) if the barrier in the effective potential energy eXists then the ions/electrons are reﬂected from this barrier.

For the description of motion in the central force ﬁeld we refer to Section 3.1.1. For electrons the total energy is
positive and there is no barrier in the effective potential. Consequently, the difference of the actual electron distribution
from the Boltzmann one is associated only with condition (ii)—the electron absorption on the particle. This difference
is noticeable only in the region close to the particle, where the density is a half of the Boltzmann value, ne —>
(n0/2) eXp(egDS/ Te) [56]. Since the contribution from the ions to the Poisson equation is dominant in this region,
the effect of electron absorption is of minor importance for the potential distribution, and the use of the Boltzmann
distribution is sulﬁciently accurate.

For ions, all three conditions have to be taken into account when determining E. If we for a moment neglect the ion
absorption and the barrier in the effective potential, then integration in Eq. (32) with the only constraint 6(1),», v9, r) 2 0
yields [56,142]

no ﬁ T,- T,- T,-
The ion density increases towards the particle, but not as rapidly as the Boltzmann distribution does. This important
conclusion is rather general in View of the assumptions made in deriving Eq. (33): ion absorption and the barrier in the
effective potential further deplete the ion density in the Vicinity of the particle.

An approximate solution to the Poisson equation with Boltzmann electrons and ion distribution given by Eq. (33)
was recently delivered by Tsytovich et al. [143]. It deviates considerably from the Yukawa form (31). The obtained
solution is, however, not a self—consistent one, because it contradicts with the initial assumption that there is no barrier
in the effective potential.

In general case the ion density 71,- is expressed in terms of the electrostatic potential go Via an integral, in a very
complicated fashion [56,144]. The ion density at a point r depends not only on the value of the potential at this point,
but on the whole @(r) behaviour. The Poisson equation then represents a nonlinear integro-differential equation which
requires numerical solution [144]. In the context of dusty plasmas only a few numerical calculations for a limited set
of plasma parameters were performed. For example, Daugherty et al. [81] followed Bernstein and Rabinowitz [144]
assuming monoenergetic ions in order to simplify the solution procedure. The electrostatic potential was then calculated
numerically. The main results can be formulated as follows: in a Vicinity of the particle, at r less than a few xl, the
potential can be well approximated by the Yukawa form, Eq. (31). For small particles (a < 213), the effective screening
length 2 is close to the ion Debye radius, 2 ~ 2m, and for larger particles (a 2 2D), 2 increases with a and can reach
values comparable to xlpe. At larger distances, the potential tends asymptotically to OC r—2 dependence, which is well
known from the probe theory [5 6]. Similar results were later obtained in Ref. [26].

Recently a consistent numerical calculations for the particle surface potential and potential distribution around the
particle in a plasma with Maxwellian ions was reported [64]. Although, the emphasis of this work was on the effect
of the barrier in effective potential on the ion current that the particle could collect, some results for the potential
distribution were also presented. It was found that there is a vacuum-like region near the particle surface where the
potential scales as @(r) o< r‘ 1 , while far from the particle @(r) o< 1,—2. In between, there is a transition region where the
potential decreases faster. Apparently, for not too large distances from the particle, the potential can be approximated

"
"28","28 VE. Forlov el al. /Physz'cs Reports 421 (2005) 1—103
by the Yukawa form with some effective screening length. However, detailed consideration of this issue is absent in
Ref. [64].

Thus, available numerical results suggest that at intermediate distances from the particle the actual potential in
collisionless plasmas can be approximated by the Yukawa form (31) with an appropriately chosen screening length.
At the same time, no strong physical arguments have been given to justify this approximation, and, hence there is
no reason to believe that this is the best approximation among other possibilities. This issue obviously needs further
investigation. Far from the particle the potential scales as @(r) o< r—2 due to plasma absorption. This scaling can be
easily derived analytically. Neglecting the barrier in the effective potential, the condition for the ion absorption can be
formulated in accordance with Eq. (6): p g cm 1 — Zeqos /m,- v2. Rewriting it in terms of Ur and v9 and using the fact that
lqosl > |q0(r)| at r >61, we get that for v9 §(a/r)x/ v3 — Zeqos/mi only the ions with vr < O are present. Integration in
(32) yields

2

The potential distribution in this region is determined from the quasineutrality condition n e 2 ni. Assuming gas 2 Z 6 / a
and using dimensionless parameters we arrive at the following asymptote [3,56,62,145,146]:

at large r. Usually I > 1 and z ~ 1, so that we have @(r) 2 Zea/Zrz.

An additional complication in the theory of electrostatic potential around the dust particle is associated with
ion—neutral collisions. The possible importance of this effect should not be underestimated. In the weakly collisional
situation Z,- > x] the collisions, no matter how infrequent, will create ions with negative total energy in the Vicinity of the
minima in the effective potential energy. These ions are trapped in the potential well and orbit the particle until another
collision untraps an ion or it is absorbed on the particle surface. Because the creation and loss rates of trapped ions
are both proportional to the collision frequency, the number of orbiting ions in the stationary state is independent of
collision frequency. Trapped ions increase the ion density in the Vicinity of the particle and can considerably affect the
electrostatic potential. For example Lampe et al. [66] showed that under certain conditions the presence of trapped ions
can lead to better agreement between the potential calculated in a self—consistent way and the Debye—Huékel potential
for distances up to several Debye radii. The effect of ion—neutral collisions on the potential was also documented by
Zobnin et al. [65], who observed that with increasing ion collisionality a transition from the Yukawa to the unscreened
(Coulomb) potential occurs. This is in agreement with the fact that in the highly collisional regime for the ions the
potential scales as @(r) o< r‘1 in the absence of ionization/recombination processes (see Section 3.1.5).

To conclude the section, one should note that a self—consistent calculation of the electrostatic potential around the
particle and its dependence on parameters of the ambient plasma still is a very important unsolved problem in complex
plasmas.

4.2. Anisotropicplasmas

Strong electric ﬁelds are often present in laboratory conditions (e.g., in if sheaths or do striations). This causes the ion
drift relative to the particles and, hence, creates a perturbed region of plasma density downstream from the particle—a
wake. One can apply the linear dielectric response formalism (see e.g., [147]) to calculate the potential distribution in
this case. This approach is applicable provided ions are weakly coupled to the particle (nonlinear region around the
particle is small compared to the plasma screening length). Note that larger ion drift velocities imply better applicability
of the linear theory. The electrostatic potential created by a point-like charge at rest is deﬁned in this approximation as

ions are focusing behind the grain thus forming the region with highly enhanced ion density. The distances are measured in units of the electron
Debye length.
Where 8(a), k) is the plasma permittivity. Using a certain model for the permittivity [see, e.g., Eqs. (54), (76) and (78)
for the ion response], one can calculate the anisotropic potential distribution [148—154]. The potential proﬁle can also
be obtained from numerical modelling [145,155—159]. Fig. 14 shows the contour plot of the ion density in the wake,
as obtained from the MD simulations [156].

Physically, generation of electrostatic wakes in anisotropic dusty plasmas is analogous to the generation of elec—
tromagnetic waves by a particle at rest, Which is placed in a moving medium [160,161] and the analogy With the
VaViIOV—Cherenkov effect can be useful.

The qualitative description of this effect is the following: in the directions upstream from and perpendicular to the
ion ﬂow, anisotropy is of minor importance. Within a certain solid angle downstream from the ﬂow, the potential is no
longer monotonic, but has a well pronounced extremuni (maximum for a negatively charged particle). As shown by
numerical modelling, the shape of the wake potential is sensitive to ion collisions (ion—neutral collisions) [162] and
the electron—to—ion temperature ratio Which governs Landau damping [163]. In typical situations, these mechanisms
can effectively “smear out” the oscillatory wake structure, leaving a single maximum. The shape of the wake potential
depends on the value of the Mach number M 2 Mi /C1A, however, the wake itself appears both in supersonic and
subsonic regimes of the ion drift. In this context, we mention the work of Lampe et al. [145] Where some examples of
the wake structures calculated numerically for different plasma conditions are presented. The effects of ﬁnite particle
size and asymmetry of the charge distribution over its surface are considered in Refs. [164,165].

In this section we considered the potential distribution around an isolated particle. Such a consideration is justiﬁed
When the number density of the dust component is low enough and the interparticle separation signiﬁcantly exceeds
the Debye radius. Otherwise, the dust collective effects can of signiﬁcant importance, so that dust can also contribute
to the plasma screening of a test charge. The details can be found in the recent review by Morﬁll et al. [166].

5. Interaction between particles in complex plasmas
5.1. Isotropic plasmas

The potential of interaction between dust particles is, generally speaking, not only of electrostatic nature. This
is due to variability of the particle charges, particle coupling to the surrounding plasma, etc. In addition, “collective
interactions” can operate when the dust can be treated as the “true” plasma component [166]. In this review we consider
the case of sulﬁciently low dust concentrations, when the interparticle interaction (as well as screening and charging)
can be calculated in the approximation of “isolated” particles. In this case, the absolute value of the electrostatic
force acting on a particle with ﬁxed charge Z and located at a distance r from the test particle is F61 = —dU61(r)/dr,
where

Ue1(1”) = Z6900”) .
Thus, it is necessary to know the distribution of the electrostatic potential @(r) in the plasma around the dust particle.
It was shown in the preceding section that this problem is fairly complicated and requires further investigation. At
the current level of understanding it seems reasonable to adopt the Yukawa—type potential [Eq. (31)] at intermediate
distances from the particle, in order to model the interaction in isotropic plasmas. Then the interaction potential
energy is
Z262 r
U610"") 2 — exp (——) .
r xi
At longer interparticle distances (typically more than several screening lengths) the long-range asymptote operates
[Eq. (34)] and the interaction energy can be written as U61 2 Z 262a / 2r2. This estimate holds for distances not exceeding
the mean free path of ions, because collisions effectively destroy the anisotropy in the ion velocity distribution.

In addition to that, different attraction and repulsion mechanisms can eXist as a consequence of the openness of
dusty plasma systems—the openness caused by continuous exchange of energy and matter between the particles and
surrounding plasma.

The continuous ﬂow of the plasma electrons and ions on the surface of a dust particle leads to a drag experienced
by neighbouring particles. This can result in an effective attractive force between the particles, which is called the ion
shadowing force. The magnitude of this force is mainly determined by the ion component due to larger ion masses.
Such an attractive mechanism was ﬁrst considered by Ignatov [167] and Tsytovich et al. [168], and later on in Refs.
[145,146,169]. Note that the ion shadowing force basically represents the ion drag force in the ion ﬂow directed to
the surface of a test particle. Strictly speaking, the ion shadowing force is not pairwise, since the interaction between
several particles (more than two) depends on their mutual arrangement.

Another attraction (repulsion) between the particles can be associated with neutral atoms, provided they are scattered
from the particle surface with the energy distribution different from that of the ambient neutral gas. This can happen,
e.g., if the surface temperature TS is different from the neutral gas temperature Tn and full or partial accommodation
takes place. The temperature of the particle surface is governed by the balance of various processes, such as radiative
cooling, exchange of energy with neutrals, and recombination of electrons and ions on the surface [170]. In the case
TS 7E Tn, there exist net ﬂuxes of energy and momentum between gas and particles. Hence, if two particles are located
sulﬁciently close to each other, an anisotropy in momentum ﬂuxes on the particles will also exert a shadowing force
between them, which in this case is associated with the neutral component. The force is repulsive when TS > Tn and is
attractive in the opposite case. This effect was ﬁrst considered by Tsytovich et al. [171].

Both for neutral and ion shadowing effects, the corresponding potentials scale as QC 1 /r. Hence, at large distances
the shadowing interaction will overcome the long-range electrostatic repulsion. The existence of attraction makes the
formation of dust molecules possible (an association of two or more particles coupled by long-range attraction). The
theoretical examination of the conditions of molecular formation can be found in Refs. [3,146]. For isotropic plasmas,
however, the formation of dust molecules has not yet been experimentally established. First of all, this can be explained
by the fact that rather large particles are needed for the substantial shadowing effect. In ground-based experiments, such
particles can levitate only in the sheath regions of discharges, where the electric ﬁeld is strong enough to balance the

"
"31","VE. Forlov el al. /Physz'cs Reports 42] (2005) I —103 31
gravity and the effects of plasma anisotropy are of primary importance. The ions drifting with superthermal velocities
provide almost no contribution neither to screening nor to shadowing.

5.2. Anisotropicplasmas

In anisotropic plasmas the wake effect is important (see Section 4.2). This effect is usually invoked for explaining
the vertical ordering of the dust particles (chain formation) often observed in ground-based experiments. Recently,
another effect was pointed out, which might play some role in the vertical ordering of dust particles along the ion
ﬂow. This effect is connected with a distortion of the ion velocity ﬁeld by the upstream particle and the appearance
of a horizontal component of the force, caused by the ion momentum transfer to the downstream particle [15 8]. This
force—the ion drag force—pushes the downstream particle back to the aXis with the origin at the upstream particle
position and parallel to the ion ﬂow. Numerical modelling of the ion velocity ﬁeld in the wake showed that for certain
conditions the ion drag mechanism prevails over the electrostatic one [158].

Note that both effects are sensitive to ion—neutral collisions. First, the collisions reduce the ion directed velocity
in an external electric ﬁeld (and, hence, plasma anisotropy). Second, they limit the perturbed plasma region (both the
potential and the ion velocity ﬁeld) around a probe particle to a length scale on the order of the ion mean free path.
Therefore, both mechanisms can only operate at sufﬁciently low pressures.

5.3. Experiments

Determination of the interaction potential constitutes a delicate experimental problem. Only a few such experiments
have been performed so far [18,172—176].

An elegant method based on an analysis of elastic collisions between the two particles was proposed by Konopka
et al. [18,172]. In this experiment the particles are introduced into an rf discharge through a small hole in the glass
window built into the upper electrode and are levitated above the lower electrode, where the electric ﬁeld compensates
for gravitational force. To conﬁne the particles horizontally, a ring is placed on the lower electrode, which introduces a
horizontal parabolic conﬁning potential. The manipulation of the particles and activation of elastic collisions between
them is performed with the use of a horizontal electric probe introduced into the discharge chamber. During the collision,
the particle trajectories are determined by the conﬁning potential and the interparticle interaction potential which is a
function of interparticle spacing. An analysis of recorded particle trajectories during collisions yields the coordinates
and velocities of both the particles during collision. Then, the form of the interaction potential can be reconstructed
from the equation of motion. Application of this method [18] showed that for low discharge powers and pressures
the interaction potential is of the Yukawa form (31) within experimental uncertainties. This is illustrated in Fig. 15.
The role of other interaction mechanisms is insigniﬁcant for the plasma conditions used in these experiments, which,
however, does not exclude the possibility of their existence (see Ref. [146]).

A method based on the laser manipulation of the dust particles was proposed to study interaction between the particles
in anisotropic plasmas [173]. Melzer et al. [174] employed this method for two particles suspended simultaneously in
the rf sheath: a single particle of radius a 2 1.7 [1111, and a cluster of two particles (of the same size) stuck together. The
particles were introduced into a plasma of an rf discharge in helium at a pressure of p ~ 50—200 Pa. Because of the
different charge-to-mass ratios, the double particle levitated closer to the lower electrode. Both particles, meanwhile,
were almost free to move in the horizontal plane. The ﬁrst observation was the following: for suﬁciciently low pressures,
the particles tend to form a bound state, in which the lower particle is vertically aligned to the upper one. With increasing
pressure, the bound state can be destroyed, and then the particle separation in the horizontal plane is limited only by
a very weak horizontal conﬁnement produced by a specially concave electrode. The backward decrease of pressure
brings the system back into the bound state. It was found that the effect exhibits hysteresis.

In order to prove that the observed bound state is not due to external conﬁnement, the particles were manipulated
by laser radiation. The laser beam was focused either on the upper or the lower particle, causing the motion. It was
found that when the upper particle is pushed, the lower particle follows its motion. This behaviour proves that the lower
particle is subject to an attractive horizontal force mediated by the upper particle. In contrast, when the lower particle
is pushed, the response of the upper particle is much weaker and the bound state can be easily destroyed. Hence, the
interaction between the particles is clearly nonreciprocal.

Fig. 15 . Potential energy U61 ofinteraction between two particles in a rfsheath versus the horizontal distance x between them [18]. Measurements were
taken with the particles of radius a 2 4.5 am at p = 2.7 Pa in argon and different rf peak—to—peak voltages Up. Symbols correspond to experimental
results, solid lines show their ﬁt to the Yukawa potential U61 (x) = (62 Z2 /x) eXp(—x M) leading to the following effective particle charge Z and
screening length 2. (T6 is the measured electron temperature): 1 — |Z| = 13, 900, 2. = 0.34 mm, T6 = 2.0 eV, Up = 233 V; 2 — |Z| = 16, 500,
2. = 0.40 mm, Te 2 2.2 eV, Up = 145 V; 3 — |Z| = 16, 800, 2. = 0.90 mm, Te 2 2.8 eV, Up = 64 V. Note that the screening length determined from
the experiment is closer to the Debye radius for electrons than for ions. This is in qualitative agreement with the assumption that the ion velocity is
close to the ion sound velocity C1 A = W in the (collisionless) sheath and ions do not contribute to the screening.

Another set of experiments to measure forces produced by the ion wake ﬁeld from the upper (lighter) “target” particle
by colliding the latter with the (heavier) “probe” particle levitated at a lower height in a sheath of an rf discharge was
reported by Hebner et al. [175 , l 76]. In this experiments attractive and repulsive interactions between charged particles
were calculated using Newton’s equations of motion for various experimental conditions (using different particles sizes
and neutral gas pressures). It was shown that the magnitude of attractive potential increases with lowering the gas
pressure, as expected (see discussion at the end of the preceding section). It was also found that the attractive forces
decay fairly rapidly as the vertical distance between the particles increases. Fits t0 repulsive and attractive forces were
proposed.

It is obvious that the experimental results reported in [174—176] can be explained by the wake effect. However, the
question of whether the attractive force has an electrostatic nature or is associated with the ion drag mechanism [158]
still needs to be investigated.

6. Momentum exchange in complex plasmas

The momentum exchange between different species plays an exceptionally important role in complex plasmas. For
example, the momentum transfer in collisions with the neutral gas “cool down” the system, in particular grains and
ions, introducing some damping. The forces associated with the momentum transfer from electrons and ions to the
charged grains—i.e., the electron and ion drag forces—often determine static and dynamical properties of the grain
component, affect wave phenomena, etc. The momentum exchange in grain—grain collisions and its competition with
the momentum transfer in grain—neutral gas collisions governs grain transport properties, scalings in ﬂuid ﬂows, etc.
While various aspects of electron—ion interaction (collisions) as well as electron, ion, and grain collisions with neutrals
have been well studied, comparatively little work has been done on grain—eleetron, grain—ion and grain—grain collisions.

In this section, we assume the Debye—Hﬁckel (Yukawa) potential around the dust particle and perform a detailed
analysis of the binary collisions involving the particles. First, the momentum transfer cross section for different types
of collisions is calculated and analytical approximations for some limiting cases are derived. These approximations
are used to estimate the characteristic momentum exchange rates in complex plasmas. This provides us with a uniﬁed
theory of momentum exchange in complex plasmas in the binary collision approximation. Some direct applications of
the obtained results are also considered, e.g., classiﬁcation of possible complex plasma states in terms of momentum
exchange, the hierarchy of the momentum exchange in grain—grain and grain—neutral collisions and corresponding
dynamical states of complex plasmas. In the next section these results are used to calculate the electron and ion
drag forces.

6.1. Momentum transfer cross section

We consider binary collision between two particles of masses m1 and m 2 interacting Via an isotropic potential of the

form

W) = —<Uo/r> experm .

where x1 is the eﬂective screening length, U0 > 0 for attraction and U0 < 0 for repulsion. The particle trajectories during
collision are ballistic, i.e., any types of multiple collisions are neglected. The problem is equivalent to the scattering
of a single particle of reduced mass, M = mlmz / (1m —|— mg), in the central ﬁeld U (r) (whose centre is at the centre
of masses of the colliding particles). The analysis of motion in the central ﬁeld was given in Section 3.1.1 and below
we employ the results of this analysis. First, we study the case of point-like particles. The role of the ﬁnite grain size
will be addressed later.

The momentum transfer (scattering) cross section in this approximation is given by the integral over impact parameters

00
as = 2n/0 [1 — cos X(pHp dp , (36)
where X is the deﬂection (scattering) angle. The latter depends on the impact parameter in the following way, x(p) 2
[TC — 2g0(p)|, where @(p) = pf]:O drr_2[1 — Ueff(l"", ,0)]_1/2 and Ueff(l"", p) = ,02/r2 —|— 2U(r)/,uv2 is the normalized
effective potential energy. The distance of closest approach, r0 (,0), in the integral above is the largest root of the equation
Ueff(’”a p) = 1-

The scattering parameter, MU) = |U0| /,uv2/l, introduced in Section 3.1.1 is the ratio of the Coulomb radius, RC =
|U0 |/,uv2, to the effective screening length xl. It characterizes the “coupling” between colliding particles: the coupling is
weak when the characteristic distance of interaction R0 ~ RC, introduced through |U (R0)| = % ,uvz, is shorter than the
screening length, i.e., when ﬂ(v) < 1. In the opposite limit, MU) > 1, when R0 > xl, the coupling is strong. In addition,
the normalized momentum transfer cross section, as //12, depends only on ﬂ [57,177,178], which makes 6(1)) a unique
parameter which describes momentum exchange for Yukawa interactions.

Note that the theory of Coulomb scattering, which assumes an unscreened (Coulomb) potential and a cutoff at
pm,1X = /1 in integral (3 6), is widely used to describe momentum exchange in collisions between charged particles (e.g.,
electron—ion collisions in plasmas). It holds for RC ~ R0 <1 or 6 < 1, i.e., in the limit of weak coupling. However,
for 6 >1 the theory of Coulomb scattering is not applicable: in this case the interaction range R0 is larger than the
screening length and a considerable fraction of the interaction occurs outside the Debye sphere providing substantial
contribution to the momentum transfer. The use of a cutoff at pm,1X = x1 considerably underestimates the momentum
transfer in this case [74].

Now let us estimate the characteristic values of the scattering parameter for different types of collisions involving
dust grains. Taking into account that |U0| ~ |Z|e2 for grain—electron and grain—ion collisions, and |U0| ~ Z262
for grain—grain collisions we get the following hierarchy of characteristic scattering parameters: (i) Grain—electron
collisions, 66% ~ z(a//l) ~ 0.01—0.3; (ii) Grain—ion collisions, 6‘? ~ zt(a//l) ~ 1—30; Grain—gmin collisions, 66%! ~
zd (a / xl) ~ 103—3 X 104, where zd = ZZeZ/aTd E le |(Te / Td) is the normalized potential energy of two dust grains
which are just touching. We also assumed z ~ 1, t~102, a//l~0.01—O.3, |Z| ~1O3, and zd = lelt = 105 (for
Td = T,- ), which is typical for complex plasmas. These estimates show that the coupling is weak only for grain—electron
collisions. At the same time, coupling for grain—ion and grain—grain collisions is usually strong, and the theory of
Coulomb scattering fails to describe such collisions. In connection with grain—ion collisions, this issue was recently
discussed in detail in Refs. [57,74,177,179—181].

The numerical calculation of the momentum transfer cross sections for a wide range of ﬂ (0.1 < ﬂ < 103) for both
attractive and repulsive Yukawa potential was recently reported [63]. First, the dependence of the scattering angle on
the impact parameter, x(p), was obtained. Then, Eq. (3 6) was numerically integrated yielding the momentum transfer
cross sections. The obtained results are presented in Figs. 16 and 17.

The scattering angle x(p) decreases monotonically for repulsive interactions for all 6. In contrast, for attractive
interactions a monotone decrease of the scattering angle is observed only for 6 f, 1, whilst for 1 f, 6 f, ﬁcr it becomes a
nonmonotone function of p, and at 6 > ﬁcr 2 13.2 the scattering angle diverges at the “transitional” impact parameter
p* 2 /l(ln ﬂ —|— 1 — %1n_lﬁ), see Eq. (8). The divergence of the scattering angle for attractive interactions arises from the

screening length (at p / xi SJ 1). In the opposite case ﬂ > 1 the scattering angle can be substantial even for p >1, both
for repulsive and attractive interaction. (This is another demonstration of the fact that the Coulomb scattering theory is
inapplicable for ﬂ Z 1, as discussed above.)

The results obtained for the momentum transfer cross section (Fig. 17) show the following features: the cross section
for the attractive potential is always larger than that for the repulsive potential (they converge in the limit of weak
coupling ﬂ < 1). The cross section for the repulsive potential grows monotonically, While for the attractive potential a
local maximum and minimum appear near ﬂ = ﬁcr. This nonmonotonic behaviour is a consequence of the bifurcation
Which the scattering angle x(p) experiences in the range 1 SJ ﬂ SJ ﬁcr. It is also evident from Fig. 17 that the Coulomb
scattering theory (shown by the dotted line) considerably underestimates the cross section for both repulsion and
attraction When ﬂ 2 1.

is shown by the dotted line in Fig. 17. For 6 2, 1 Eq. (37) is no longer applicable, however, an asymptotic analytical
approximation for the case 6 > 1 can be obtained as follows. The relevant characteristic of the steepness 0f the potential
is the parameter 1’0 2 la? 1n U (r) / d In r lrzRo. The case yo > 1 corresponds to a rapidly decreasing steep potential so that
the momentum is mostly transferred in a spherical “shell” of radius R0, and thickness ~R0 /y0. Hence, the scattering
resembles that of a hard sphere potential [182,183] and With increasing yo the momentum transfer cross section
tends to
H 2 2

For the Yukawa potential yo = 1 —|— R0//1> 1, provided 6 > 1. A rapidly converging analytical solution for R0 (ﬂ) is
ROM :1n2ﬁ —1n1n2ﬂ[63].

Attractive potential. For weak coupling (ﬁ< 1) the theory of Coulomb scattering is applicable. The momentum
transfer cross section is the same as for the repulsive potential and is given by Eq. (37). It was shown [74,179] that
even for moderate 6 the extension of the standard Coulomb scattering theory is possible by taking into account all
the trajectories With a distance of closest approach shorter than xi. The deﬁnition of the maximum impact parameter
(cutoff) then becomes r0 (pmax) = /1 instead of pm,1X = x1 and leads to a modiﬁcation of the Coulomb logarithm. The
modiﬁed Coulomb momentum transfer cross section is

01;“ mzz 2 432 1n(1 + 1/3) . (39)
Although the approach of [74,179] is not rigorous, Eq. (39) shows very good agreement With numerical results
[63,181,184] up t0 6 ~ 5 (see Fig. 17) and agrees exactly, of course, With Coulomb scattering theory for 6 < 1.

The case of strong coupling (6 > 1) requires a new physical approach. Such an approach was formulated in Ref. [57].
The existence of the potential barrier in Ueff at 6 > ﬁcr and the discontinuity in x(p) it causes, play a crucial role for
the analysis of collisions. As shown in Fig. 16 the dependence of the scattering angle on the impact parameter in the
limit of strong coupling (6 = 30) has the following features: for “close” (p < p*) collisions we have X —> 71 at p —> O,
and x(p) grows monotonically until p = p*, Where it diverges; for “distant” collisions (p > p* ) the scattering angle
decreases rapidly, due to the exponential screening of the interaction potential.

It is convenient to consider the contributions from close and distant collisions into the momentum transfer separately.
As shown in Ref. [57] the behaviour of X as a function of the normalized impact parameter p / p* is practically
independent of p for p < p*. This self—similarity allows us to present this contribution to the cross section (nonnalized
t0 n12) as 2 42/(p*//l)2, where 42/ = 2 f01[l — cos x(éﬂé d5 and 5 = p/p*. The numerical factor 42/ can be determined
by direct numerical integration. It was found that 42/ = 0.81 :l: 0.01 for all p in the range per g ﬁ<500 [57]. For
distant collisions the scattering angle decreases rapidly in the vicinity of p*. This makes it possible to apply the small
angle approximation to estimate their contribution to the cross section (normalized to n12) as 2 2.0 —|— 4.Oln_1ﬁ [57].
Combining these contributions and keeping terms up to 0(1), we can write the momentum transfer cross section in
the limit of strong coupling as

USSC/n/lz 2 0.81m. mz + 2.0 , (40)
where (p*//l)2 2 lnzﬂ —|— 2 ln ﬂ. Expression (40) is valid for ﬂ 2 per and point-like particles. Fig. 17 shows the very
good agreement between Eq. (40) and numerical calculations. A sufﬁciently accurate and even simpler approximation
is JEC 2 npﬁ, which can be further justiﬁed when the ﬁnite size of the dust grain is taken into account.

Concluding this section we brieﬂy discuss the role of ﬁnite particle size. In this case a new lengthscale enters the
problem. In contrast to the case of point-like particles, where the scattering is described by the single parameter p, we
now have a second parameter, a //l. If the distance of the closest approach, m, is smaller than a (or 2a for particle—particle
collisions), then the direct (touching) collision takes place. In this case we will assume absorption for grain—electron
and grain—ion collision, and specular reﬂection for grain—grains collisions.

A detailed discussion of the effect of ﬁnite grain size on the momentum transfer is given in Ref. [63]. It is shown
that for the repulsive interaction (grain—electron and grain—grain collisions) the effect of ﬁnite size considerably affect
the momentum transfer only when coupling is very weak,

B.S(a/M—l/Z , (41)
where A 2 ln(l /ﬂ) > 1 is the Coulomb logarithm. Recalling that ﬂ? ~ z(a//l) and ﬂ?! ~ zd (61/1) and since z ~ 1,
zd > 1 we conclude that the effect of ﬁnite size can usually be neglected for grain—electron and grain—grain collisions.

The effect of ﬁnite size is more important for attractive (grain—ion) interactions. For example, for sufﬁciently large
ﬂ the maximum impact parameter corresponding to ion collection is pi; = p*, as follows from Eq. (6). At the same
time the contribution to the momentum transfer from ions with p > p* vanishes at large B. Hence in this case the
momentum transfer is associated mostly with ions collected by the particle and the total momentum transfer cross
section a; (sum of the contributions due to scattering and due to absorption) tends to npi. However, this does not
imply much difference compared to the case of point-like particles, because scattering with large angles at p < p* and
absorption (which formally corresponds to the scattering at 71/2) produce comparable effects. The dependence 0; (ﬂ)
for an attractive Yukawa potential is shown in Fig. 18 for different values of 61/1. One can see that the momentum
transfer can decrease or increase (in comparison with point-like particles), depending on the values of 61/1 and ﬂ. At
the same time, the momentum transfer cross section is not very sensitive to the particle size—the deviation from as for
a point-like particle does not exceed ~50%.

6.2. Momentum exchange rates

Let us consider a test particle (dust grain) moving through a gas of ﬁeld particles (electrons, ions, or dust grains)
having an isotropic Maxwellian velocity distribution function. The test particle velocity Ltd is assumed to be smaller
than the ﬁeld particle thermal velocity UT“. Introducing the momentum exchange rate vdoC through dud /dt = —vde

The obtained results for the momentum exchange in grain—grain collisions will be used below to investigate the possible
states of complex plasmas.
6.3. Momentum exchange diagram

The grain charges in complex plasmas, as well as the plasma screening length are not constant. This is why the
strength of the electrostatic coupling between the grains can be easily changed experimentally over a fairly wide range
(by varying, e.g., the discharge conditions [186]). This is a major distinguishing feature of complex plasmas compared
to usual plasmas, where the ion charges are normally constant (single). In complex plasmas, one can observe the
transitions from the disordered, weakly coupled to strongly coupled states and the formation of ordered structures of
grains—plasnia crystals [3,1 1—14,26,104,180,186—192].

Another major distinguishing feature of complex plasmas is that the overall dynamical time scales associated with
the dust component are relatively long (dust plasma frequency ~1O—1OOHZ) [3,76,104]. Furthennore, the grains
themselves are large enough to be easily Visualized individually. All together this makes it possible to investigate
phenomena occurring in different phases at the most fundamental kinetic level [180,186,191]. Although there is always
some damping introduced into the complex plasma systems due to neutral gas friction [104], the resulting damping
rate is many orders of magnitude smaller than that in colloidal suspensions, and it can easily be made much smaller
than the maj or eigenfrequencies of the dust dynamics. Hence the most interesting dynamical phenomena have usually
enough time to evolve [191].

Let us dwell upon these features of complex plasmas in detail.

Fig. 19 represents different “phase states” of complex plasmas as functions of the electrostatic coupling parameter
F s and the mean grain separation A, normalized either to the grain size a or to the screening length A (“ﬁniteness
parameter” at: A /a and “lattice parameter” K = A M, respectively). The parameter F s = F eXp(— K) , which characterizes
the “actual” coupling ratio (potential energy/kinetic energy) at the average intergrain distance, is expressed in terms
of the (Coulomb) coupling scale F = 62 Z2 / A Td (note that in terms of F and K the thennal scattering parameter is
ﬂ?! = 2FK). The use of F s implies that the calculations should be representative to some extent for other types of
“similar” interaction potentials, too (Viz., with “similar” long- and short-range asymptotes). The vertical line K = 1
conditionally divides the diagram into weakly screened (Coulomb) and strongly screened (Yukawa) parts. In Fig. 19 we
have set xi/a E at / K = 100, which is typical of complex plasmas studied so far, but there is in principle a wide range of
variation, depending on grain size and plasma conditions chosen. The “melting line” which indicates the liquid—solid
phase transition and is shown by the upper solid line in Fig. 19 is discussed in Section 10.

Further insight into the possible phase states shown in Fig. 19 are obtained from our above results on the momentum
transfer cross section for grain—grain collisions. This approach allows us to obtain a clear physical classiﬁcation of
complex plasmas. The lower solid line indicates the “transition” between “ideal” and “nonideal” plasmas. We determine
this transition from the condition W = (471/3)_1/3 A , which implies that the characteristic range of grain interaction
(in terms of the momentum exchange) is comparable to the intergrain distance (in terms of the Wigner—Seitz radius).

Fig. 19. “Momentum exchange” diagram of complex plasmas in (F5, K) parameter space. The vertical dashed line at K = l conditionally divides
the system into “Coulomb” and “Yukawa” parts. Different states are marked in the ﬁgure. Regions I (V) represent Coulomb (Yukawa) crystals;
Regions II (VI) are for Coulomb (Yukawa) nonideal plasmas; Regions III (VII and VIII) correspond to Coulomb (Yukawa) ideal plasmas; note that
in region VIII the pair Yukawa interaction asymptotically reduces to the hard sphere limit, forming a “Yukawa granular medium”; In region IV the
electrostatic interaction is not important and the system is like a usual granular medium. For further explanations see text.
Above this line the interaction is essentially multipartiele, whereas below the line only pair collisions are important.
This reﬁnes the standard condition used to deﬁne a “boundary” between ideal and nonideal plasmas, F5 ~ 1. From
the thermodynamical point of View, this line determines the limit of employing expansions of the thermodynamical
functions (e.g., Virial expansion) over the (small) coupling parameter.

It is important to note that for a Yukawa potential (as well as for any monotonic interaction potential) no liquid—gas
phase transition is possible (formally, the critical point occurs at Td = 0). This is different, if the pair potential is
not monotonic, e.g., a long range attractive component added to a repulsive electrostatic potential exists, as has been
suggested by several authors (see e.g., Refs. [3,146,180]). So far, however, there are no reliable experiments reporting
on the observation of, e.g., the coexistence of liquid and gaseous phases, or other indications of a ﬁrst order phase
transition in gaseous complex plasmas.

The regions where the system is similar to a granular medium are also shown in Fig. 19: below the lower dotted curve
the electrostatic interaction is too weak and the momentum exchange occurs due to direct grain collisions, i.e., we have
a usual granular medium where charges do not play any noticeable role. This line corresponds to ﬂ?! = (a/xl)/l;d1/2
[see Eq. (41)]. The upper dotted curve marks the transition boundary for a very interesting state, which we have called
“Yukawa granular medium”. Here the “mean” scattering parameter for grain—grain collisions exceeds unity (ﬁgd > 1)
and, hence, the strongly screened electrostatic interaction reduces asymptotically to the hard sphere limit with radius
R0 2 Im(zﬁd).

Next, we investigate complex plasma properties in terms of the competition between the momentum exchange in
mutual grain—grain collisions and the interaction with the surrounding medium.

Complex plasmas can be “engineered” as essentially a “one-phase ﬂuid” (when the interactions between the grains
dominate), or as a “particle laden two-phase ﬂow” (when the interactions with the background medium are of similar or
greater importance). We have illustrated this by plotting contours of constant ratios of the grain—grain/grain—background
momentum exchange rates, vdd/vdn, in the (FS,K) diagram in Fig. 20.

In complex plasmas the exchange of momentum with the background medium is mostly through grain—neutral gas
collisions,

Fig. 20. Typical contours are shown of constant ratios of the momentum exchange rates in grain—grain collisions relative to grain-background (neutral
gas) collisions. The values Vdd/Vdn = 102, 10, 1, 10—1, and 10—2 are depicted in a phase diagram for complex plasmas in (PS, K) parameter space
(from left to right). Also shown in the ﬁgure are the lines corresponding to crystal melting (solid line) and the boundary between ideal and nonideal
plasmas (dashed line). For the calculations we use the following parameters: Grains of radius a = 1 mm and material mass density of 1 g/cm3 in
argon plasma at neutral gas pressure 100 Pa; room temperature ions and neutrals Tl- ~ Tn ~ 0.03 eV, and a M = 10—2.
where mn, nn, and an are the mass, density, and thermal velocity of neutrals, respectively [193]. The value of the
numerical factor 5 depends on the exact process of neutral scattering from the particle surface. For example, 5 = 1
for the cases of complete absorption and specular reﬂection, whilst 5 = 1 —|— 71/8 2 1.4 for diffuse scattering with full
accommodation. We choose the later value which is more consistent with recent experimental results [194].

For the momentum exchange rate in grain—grain collisions we use Eq. (47) at ﬂ?! > 1 (upper symbols in the ﬁgure)
and Eq. (46) at ﬂ?! < 1 (lower symbols). In the transition regime 664d ~ 1 none of these approximations is applicable
and we have therefore simply linked the two regimes by dotted lines.

Fig. 20 shows that there is a broad range of parameters where complex plasmas have the properties of one-phase
ﬂuids (vdd /vdn > 1), and those of two-phase ﬂuids vdd/vdn ~ 1. In the extreme limit of very small vdd/vdn we can also, of
course, have “tracer particles” in the background medium, which provide practically no disturbance to the background
ﬂow. Taking into account that a number of plasma parameters (e.g., the neutral gas pressure, plasma screening length,
the ratio a //1) can be varied relatively easily within approximately one order of magnitude, most of the possible states
can be investigated.

In concluding this section we note that not all of the assumptions employed to simplify the calculations are necessarily
satisﬁed in real complex plasmas. A few examples are: deviation of grain potential from the Yukawa form [3,146,180],
dependence of the grain charge on intergrain distance [166], destruction of ballistic trajectories by collisions with
neutrals [195], etc. Nevertheless, in many cases this simple model does provide reasonable predictions and hence it
can be considered as the basis for more sophisticated models. The obtained results can be important for “engineering”
experiments which aim to make use of special properties of complex plasmas.

7. Forces on particles in complex plasmas

Knowledge of the maj or forces acting on microparticles in complex plasmas is essential for understanding dynamic
phenomena and equilibrium conﬁgurations of complex plasmas observed in experiments. The forces can be naturally
divided into two groups: the ﬁrst one includes the forces which have electric nature—electron drag, ion drag, and
electrostatic forces, whereas the second one includes the charge-independent forces—gravity, neutral drag, and ther-
mophoretic forces. The calculation of the ion drag force is rather complicated in some cases. At the same time, this
force is of particular importance in complex plasmas and therefore it is a subject of a separate section.

7.]. Ion dragforce

The ion drag force—the momentum transfer from the ﬂowing ions to charged microparticles (grains) embedded into a
plasma—is ineVitable and exceptionally important factor in dusty (complex) plasmas. Ion ﬂows are usually induced due
to “global” large-scale electric ﬁelds that always eXist in plasmas (e.g., ambipolar or sheath ﬁelds in plasma discharges).
Knowledge of the ion drag force as a function of the plasma parameters (which may vary over a quite broad range) is
necessary for understanding phenomena occurring in laboratory and space environment. The very fact that the ion drag
force can be important in dusty plasmas was ascertained even before the active laboratory investigation of dusty plasmas
started [196,197]. Presently, it is considered to be established that ion drag affects (or even detennines) location and
conﬁguration of the dust structures in laboratory plasma facilities [22,198,199], is responsible for the rotation of dust
structures (e.g., clusters) in the presence of a magnetic ﬁeld [200—202], affects the properties of low-frequency waves
in dusty plasmas [203—205], causes the formation of a void in the central part of if discharges in experiments under
microgravity conditions [20,23,180], determines diffusion and mobility of dust particles in strongly ionized plasmas
[206,207], etc.

The traditional way to derive the ion drag force on the test charged particle is based on the “binary collision approach”.
The force is detennined by the momentum exchange rate in the dust—ion collisions, averaged over given velocity
distribution of ions (see Section 6.2). Initially, the binary collision approach was applied by Uglov and Gnedovets [91]
to calculate the ion drag in the “Coulomb scattering” limit—basically, this is the linear approximation assuming the
ion scattering with small angles within the Debye sphere. A simpliﬁed treatment of this problem was given by Barnes
et al. [198]. Recently, the approach was extended by Khrapak et al. [57,74,177,179] to calculate the force in the case
of large angle scattering.

An alternative way to calculate the ion drag force is the kinetic approach based on the so-called “linear dielectric
response fonnalism” (e.g., [208,209]). Instead of calculating single ion trajectories and then integrating the resulting
momentum transfer, one can solve the Poisson equation coupled to the kinetic equation for ions and obtain the self-
consistent electrostatic potential around the particle. The polarization electric ﬁeld at the origin of the test charge gives
us the force on the particle. Recently, IVleV et al. [195 ,2 l 0,21 1] applied this fonnalism for calculating the ion drag force
for arbitrary velocity of the ion ﬂow and arbitrary frequency of the ion—neutral collisions.

In this section we present the results of both approaches and discuss unresolved issues.

7.1.]. Binary collision approach

In the framework of this approach, the ion drag force Fid is completely determined by the (velocity-dependent) total
momentum transfer cross section for the dust—ion collisions, 0;, which was introduced in Section 6.1. The force is
Fid =md vdl-u , where u is the ion ﬂow velocity and de' is the momentum exchange rate (the latter is given by averaging over
the ion velocity distribution). The force depends on the magnitude of the thermal scattering parameter, 6T 2 62 | Z | MT,- ,
where 2 is the effective screening length (which does not necessarily coincide with the Debye screening length, see
Sections 4.1 and 7.1.3).

For subthermal ﬂows (when the thermal Mach number is small, MT E M, /le. < l), we directly employ results of
Section 6.2.2: at moderate 6T f, 5, Eq. (43) yields

where A(ﬂT) 2 [000 e‘x ln(1 —|— 2x / ﬂT) dx 2 —e/3T/ 2Ei(— ﬂT / 2) is the modiﬁed Coulomb logarithm integrated over
the Maxwellian distribution function. Here we also assume xi 2 213,- (see Section 7.1.3). Eq. (49) yields the scaling
Fid o< (Z / 2)2. In the linear regime ﬂT < 1 the logarithm is reduced to A 2 ln ﬁgl, which is identical to the results of
the Coulomb scattering theory. In the opposite regime of strongly nonlinear scattering, ﬂT > ﬂcr 2 13, we obtain from
Eq. (45)

In this case the force depends logarithmically 0n the scattering parameter and, hence, 011 Z and 2. Note that for M T < 1
the effective screening length is determined by ions, since the electron temperature is typically two orders ofniagnitude
higher than the ion (neutral) temperature.

For superthernial ion ﬂows with M T > 1, the drift velocity rather than the thermal velocity should be used to evaluate
the scattering parameter ﬂ. Also, the screening is determined by the electrons rather than by ions in this case, 2 2 2136
(see Section 7.1.3). Therefore, we conclude from Eq. (7) that the scattering parameter decreases rapidly with the Mach
number, and we can expect the linear scattering (weak coupling, ﬂ ~ ﬂT /M% g 1) to be typical for M T > 1. Then the
momentum transfer cross section is given by Eq. (3 7) and after the integration over the shifted Maxwellian distribution
the force is

(Application of the binary collision approach implies that the ion mean free path should nevertheless exceed the electron
screening length 2136). The ion drag decreases as (X M;2 at large Mach numbers (neglecting a weak logarithmic
dependence). For sufﬁciently high ﬂow velocities the momentum ﬂux onto the grain (collection) dominates over the
scattering part and then the force tends to the “geometrical asymptote”, Fid 2 (T,- /e)2(a/2/1D,-)2M%, which does not
depend on the grain charge [212].
7.1.2. Kinetic approach

The binary collision approach is intrinsically inconsistent. There are the following reasons for that: (i) While the
ion interacts with the charged particle, the interactions with other species (in particular— the ion—neutral collisions)
are neglected. (ii) The approach presumes certain potential distribution around the test charge, although the potential
is a self—consistent function of the plasma environment (e.g., ion ﬂow velocity). (iii) The approach presumes certain
distribution function for ions (usually, the shifted Maxwellian distribution). All these issues can be successfully resolved
by employing the self-consistent kinetic approach.

Calculation of the ion drag force is based on the linear dielectric response formalism: the self—consistent distribution
of the electrostatic potential around a grain of charge eZ is given by Eq. (35). Being embedded into a ﬂowing plasma,
the grain induces the plasma polarization. The magnitude of the polarization ﬁeld at the charge origin r = 0 determines
the force acting on the grain due to ﬂowing ions: Fid = —eZVq0|r=0 [195,213]. Of course, the ion drag acts on the grain
together with the usual electrostatic force due to the global ﬁeld, F61 = eZE. The ion drag force is obviously parallel
to the ﬂow and can be written as [210,211]

The linear kinetic approach is not valid in the immediate vicinity of the charged particle, where the electrostatic
perturbations are too strong. The size of this Vicinity is equal by the order of magnitude to the ion Coulomb radius
RC ~ RT (1 —|— M %)_l , which deﬁnes the upper limit of integration, kmax ~ R ‘1. The criterium of applicability of Eq.
(52) is the relative smallness of the actual contribution to the force from the “nonlinear” region r g R (this is discussed
below). Since kmax enters the ﬁnal formula logarithmically (and the argument of the logarithm is assumed to be large),
one can use the obtained order-of-niagnitude estimate for the calculations (e.g., [195 ,213]).

The plasma permittivity 8(a), k) = 1 —|— Xe —|— Xi is determined by the electron and ion responses. For electrons the
Boltzmann form is assumed, Xe 2 (k/lDe)_2, and the ion contribution is obtained from the solution of the linearized
kinetic equation coupled to the Poisson equation. In order to include the ion—neutral collisions, it was proposed
[99,210,211] to write the ion collision integral, Stfi, in the model Bhatnagar—Gross—Krook (BGK) form [147,214]:
Stfl- 2 Vin (71,45 — fi), where CD(v) = (27tv%n)_3/2 eXp(—v2 / 21%”) is the (isotropic) Maxwellian velocity distribution
of neutrals normalized to unity, 71,- = f f,- dV is the ion density, and Vin is the ion—neutral collision frequency. The
functionalform 0f the BGK collision integral is particularly suitable for the description of the charge-exchange collisions
[210,211]. Generally, the ion—neutral collision cross section is a complicated (monotonically decreasing) function of
the ion velocity which cannot be generally approximated by any simple scaling [83,215]. It is reasonable, therefore,
to choose the approximation Vin: const which allows us to represent the model collision operator in the convenient
algebraic form.

length. For Z,- 2/113 the function {7/ is negligibly small compared to the Coulomb logarithm and Eq. (55) yields the
standard collisionless expression for the ion drag force [Eq. (49) for ﬂT < 1] derived from the binary collision approach
[74,198]. In terms of the ion kinetics, the origin of this force is the Landau damping. In the opposite limit Z,- < 2D the
hydrodynamic effects become more important, and the expression in the brackets in Eq. (55) changes from ln ﬁgl t0

Fig. 21. Normalized ion drag force versus the thermal Mach number of the ion ﬂow M T [211]. The force depends on two parameters: scattering
parameter [3 T 2 RT / 2D, and ratio of the screening length to the thermal mean free path, 2D Ml- . The data points are obtained by numerical integration
of Eq. (52) with the ion susceptibility from Eq. (54), for [3;1 = 10 (a) and [3;1 = 100 (b). Symbols represent 1D Ml- = 0.1 (square), 1D Ml- = 1
(circle), and iD/El- = 10 (triangle). Analytic asymptotes at small and large Mach numbers [Eqs. (55) and (5 6), respectively] correspond to the same
values of 1D Ml- (solid, dashed, and dotted lines, respectively).

At large MT the kinetic approach yields the force Which scales as Fid o< MT_1, in contrast to the scaling (X M;2 in
the binary collision approach [see Eq. (51)]. This is because the ion distribution (53) deviates signiﬁcantly from the
Maxwellian form in the superthermal regime. The scaling Fid (X M T— 1 is not affected by a particular dependence of Vin
0n the ion velocity and, hence, it is a generic feature of the self—consistent approach at large Mach numbers. Another
feature Which follows from the kinetic consideration is the dependence of the force on the ion mean free path. Fig.
21 shows that frequent ion—neutral collisions (Z;- < 213) enhance the force at small M T. This is due to the ion focusing
[195]: each collision “eliminates” the angular momentum the ion had (With respect to the particle) before the collision.
Therefore, the motion of the ﬂowing ions becomes more “radial” due to the attraction towards the charged particle—the
“focusing centre” downstream moves closer to the particle. This additional focusing implies the local increase of the ion
density and, hence, increase of the polarization (force). This mechanism, however, can operate only if the ﬁeld of the
charged particle is stronger than the global ﬁeld E . Otherwise, if E is relatively strong (Mach number is large), it should
de-focus the ion traj ectories: after each collision, the ions should accelerate mostly along E . Increase of collisionality
(decrease of El) at constant M T (X E Z,- implies increase of the global electric ﬁeld and, hence, stronger de-focusing. In
turn, the latter implies the decrease of the polarization (force) Which we see in Fig. 21.

The linear kinetic approach is valid When the arguments of the logarithms in Eqs. (55) and (56) are large—this
provides the so-called “logarithmic accuracy” of the results [210,211]. For MT <1, the applicability of Eq. (55) is
ﬁT <1. In this limit, the collisionless part of Eq. (55) coincides With the results of the binary collision approach
[see Eq. (49)]. Larger Mach numbers imply better applicability—similar t0 the results of the binary collision approach
[Eq. (51)], the argument of the logarithm in Eq. (5 6) grows With M T. Note that at large Mach numbers the ion absorbtion
by the grain can contribute to the force. The absorption can be neglected at M T g [(213 /a) ﬁT]2/3 , Which is M T g 30 — 50
for typical parameters of complex plasmas [210,21 1].

7.1.3. Complementarity 0f the two approaches

Comparing the results of the linear kinetic approach and the binary collision approach, the most important conclusion
to be drawn is that these approaches are not really competitive but rather complementary: binary collision approach
is more suitable to describe highly nonlinear collisionless cases When both the ion Coulomb radius RC and the mean
free path exceed the screening length [57,74]. This situation is typical for subthermal ion ﬂows, When RC is relatively
large. Small Mach numbers also imply weak distortion of the potential around the charged particle and weak deviation
of the ion distribution from the shifted Maxwellian function. Therefore, there is no need to employ the self—consistent
kinetic approach in this case. On the other hand, for superthermal ions (When RC decreases rapidly With the Mach
number and, hence, the linear theory can be better applied!) both the particle potential and ion distribution function are
highly anisotropic, and then the self—consistent kinetic approach is necessary. Also, in contrast to the binary collision
approach, the kinetic approach allows us to take into account the ion—neutral collisions.

The kinetic approach also allows us to deduce how the eﬁ’ective screening length of the particle potential, 2, depends on
the ion ﬂow velocity [212]. This is an important issue Which was discussed recently [217,218]. At M T g 1 the potential
distribution around the grain is weakly affected by the ﬂow, so that the screening is determined by the linearized
screening length, /l 2 (/lBi2 —|— 213: )‘1/2. At superthermal ﬂows the ion contribution to the screening rapidly vanishes
and the effective screening length tends to asymptote x1 2 2136. Fig. 22 shows that this transition occurs in a fairly
narrow range of velocities around M T 2 1 — 3. The exact analytical form of A(MT) is rather complicated, but it can be
approximated reasonably well With formula /l_2 2 f (M THE? —|— 2133, Where the ﬁtting function is f = eXp(—M % / 2)
(shown in Fig. 22) or f = (1 + M%)_1 [212].

One should emphasize, however, that often the experimental conditions are such that the linear treatment is not
possible (e.g., bulk plasmas, When the linear approach can be applied only for submicron particles), but at the same
time the collisions are important (pressures ~30 Pa or higher) [195,210,211]. So far, there have been no approach
proposed to treat this case analytically, and this issue remains the maj or challenge for the theory of the ion drag.

7.2. Otherforces

Similar to the ion drag force, the electron dragforce arises due to the momentum transfer from the electrons drifting
relative to the charged particles. In the binary collision approximation the electron drag force is Fed = mdvdeue, Where
vde is given by Eq. (42). Compared to the ion drag force, the effect of the electron drag is usually ignored because

"
"46","46 VE. Forlov el al. /Physz'cs Reports 42] (2005) 1—103

the electron-to-ion mass ratio is small. This is true when He ~ ui, e.g., in if discharges, where electrons and ions
drift together due to the ambipolar diffusion. However, in the case of independent (mobility limited) drift (e.g., in the
positive column of a dc discharge) the ratio of the ion-to-electron drag forces is independent of masses and can be
approximately estimated as Fid/ Fed ~ (Te / Ti)2 (Jen /a,-n), where 060-)” is the transport cross section for electron (ion)
collisions with neutrals [185]. A detailed investigation shows that the electron drag force can indeed dominate over the
electric and ion drag force in most of noble gases with relatively small electron temperatures (Te f, 1 eV) [185].

In ground-based conditions the gravitationalforce Fg = md g usually plays an important role. In order to levitate
the particle, it should be counterbalanced by other forces. The electric force due to electric ﬁeld in the (pre)sheath
or striation regions of discharges can provide the balance. The magnitude of the electric force is F61 = ZeE, where
E is the electric ﬁeld strength. A correction to F61 due to plasma polarization in the Vicinity of the dust particle (of
the order of 61/21), induced by the external electric ﬁeld) was derived by Daugherty et al. [219]. This effect increases
the absolute magnitude of the electric force. The external ﬁeld induces also a dipole moment on a particle, ~ a3E,
which is pointed along the ﬁeld. For a dielectric particle, an additional dipole moment can be induced due to anisotropy
in charging [98]. In the nonuniform electric ﬁeld such a dipole will experience an additional force ~%a3(E2)’. It is
worth mentioning that the particle charge in the electric ﬁeld is implicitly dependent on the ﬁeld magnitude through
e.g., induced plasma and/ or charging anisotropy, ion (electron) drift velocities, etc. The problem of trapped ions is also
important issue related to the electric force acting on a particle in plasmas: ions on trapped orbits can shield the particle
from external electric ﬁeld, leading to a decrease of the electric force.

If a temperature gradient is present in a neutral gas, then the particle experiences a thermophoreticforce. The force is
due to asymmetry in the momentum transfer from neutrals and is directed towards lower gas temperatures. In the case
of full accommodation of neutrals colliding with the particle surface [213] the thermophoretic force can be expressed
as [220]

where Kn is the thermal conductivity coefﬁcient of gas. For atomic gases Kn 2 133(an /a,m), where am is the cross
section of neutral—neutral collisions [83]. In this case Fth 2 —1.8(a2/ann)VTn, i.e., the thermophoretic force depends
on the particle radius, gas type (through an”), and temperature gradient, but does not depend on the gas pressure and
temperature. For particles of about 1 1,1111 radius and mass density ~1 g cm—3 in an argon plasma, the force is comparable
to the force of gravity at temperature gradients |VTn| ~ 10 K cm‘l. The corrections to Eq. (57) for the case when the
dust particle is situated near the electrode or the walls of a discharge chamber, which basically change the numerical
factor in Eq. (57), were derived by Haynes et al. [221]. Experimental investigation of the effect of thermophoretic
force on the behaviour of dust particles in gas discharge plasmas was performed in Refs. [222—224]. In these works, it
was shown that the thermophoretic force can be used for particle leVitation in ground-based conditions as well as for

controlled action on the ordered structures of particles.

And ﬁnally, the neutral dragforce is the main mechanism responsible for friction when a particle is moving through
a stationary plasma. This is because the ionization fraction is usually quite low, on the order of 10—7—10_6. Neutral
drag can be also important when gas is ﬂowing relative to the particles. When the Knudsen number K n 2 En /a is large
and the relative velocity between the particle and the gas Ltd is small compared to the thermal velocity of neutrals an
then

Fnd = —mc1Vdnud , (58)
where vdn is the momentum exchange rate given by Eq. (48). The minus sign means that the force acts in the direction
opposite to the relative velocity. For high relative velocities (Ltd > UT”), the neutral drag force is proportional to the
velocity squared (see, for example, [225]), Fnd 2 —7ta2nnmnufl. In the opposite limit of small Knudsen numbers
K n <1 the Stokes expression (see e.g., [226]) applies, Fnd = —67maud, where n is the Viscosity of neutral gas. In
most cases Eq. (58) is applicable to calculate the neutral drag force in complex plasmas. It should be noted that this
expression was originally derived for uncharged particles in a neutral gas, i.e., neglecting the polarization interaction,
which is associated with a nonuniform electric ﬁeld in the Vicinity of the dust particle. Nevertheless, this is still a good
approximation because the radius of the polarization interaction is usually much smaller than the particle size.

8. Dynamics of single particles and particle ensembles
8.1 . Single particle dynamics

In most of the ground-based experiments, negatively charged dust particles can only leVitate in the regions of
sufﬁciently strong electric ﬁelds, where the electric force and other forces exerted in a plasma (e. g., ion drag) compensate
for gravity (unless the particles are too heavy). This occurs, for example, in the pre-sheath and sheath regions of an if
discharge, where the electric ﬁeld averaged over the oscillation period is directed along gravity force (due to the large
mass, neither the dust particles nor the ions respond to the if ﬁeld at frequency 13.56 MHz). This is also true for striations
in a dc discharge. The electric ﬁeld E in these regions rapidly increases downwards. The particle charge Z varies with
height, both due to the ion acceleration in the electric ﬁeld (see Fig. 12) and an increase of the ratio n ,- / 716 > 1 with E .
Usually, the (negative) charge ﬁrst somewhat decreases and attains a minimum, then it starts increasing and eventually
can even reach positive values. Examples of numerical calculations of the dependence of the particle surface potential
on the distance from the electrode in collisionless and collisional sheaths of if and dc discharges can be found in Ref.
[94] for a set of plasma parameters. If the vertical coordinate (height) h = O is assigned to the equilibrium particle
position, then for small displacements around the equilibrium the net force can be expanded into series,

F(h)/md = 423;; + 0an2 + m3 + - -- (59)
where 9V is the resonance frequency of vertical oscillations and coefﬁcients at,- characterize nonlinearity. The major
contribution to Eq. (5 9) is often due to the electrostatic force F61 = eZ E , and then the resonance frequency is determined
by mdQ‘Z, = —d(eZ E ) / dhl hzo. It is well known [93,227] that at suﬁciciently high pressures (e.g., above 2 20 Pa for
argon) the electric ﬁeld in the sheath varies almost linearly. At lower pressures, however, the deViations from the linear
proﬁle can be signiﬁcant. Therefore, depending on the discharge parameters and the particle mass, the nonlinearity in
Eq. (5 9) is determined either by the sheath ﬁeld proﬁle or by the charge variations with the height [227,228].

Due to the relatively large mass of the dust particles, the magnitude of the resonance frequency 9V is low enough—it is
typically in the range 1—100 Hz. Hence, it is convenient to use low-frequency excitations for determining the parameters
of the force (59) which can be then expressed through the plasma and particle parameters. As the simplest example we
refer to a harmonic excitation of particle oscillations. The oscillation amplitude A(co) grows when a) approaches 9V.
The amplitude reaches the maximum at a) = . / 9‘2, — @311, the width of the resonance peak is ~vdn. Hence, changing
a) and measuring A(co), one can determine 9V and vdn. As the excitation amplitude increases, the oscillations reveal
all features peculiar to an unharmonic oscillator: hysteresis of the frequency response curve, shift of the resonance
frequency, and secondary resonances [227,228]. Fig. 23 shows evolution of the frequency response curve, A(co), with
the amplitude of the sinusoidal excitation voltage applied to the wire below the particle. Knowledge of the resonance
frequency as well as the nonlinear coefﬁcients, recovered from the ﬁtting of the measured curves with the analytical
formulas, allows us to obtain the electric ﬁeld and/or dust particle charge distributions in a relatively broad region
across the sheath. The measurements can also be compared with the results of the numerical models, which take into
account the dependencies of particle charge, electric ﬁeld, and external force amplitude on the vertical coordinate, as
well as the location of an excitation source with respect to the dust particle and force balance in the sheath [229].

8.2. Role ofchargeﬂuctuations in the particle dynamics

Vertical oscillations of particles in the sheath regions of gas discharges can be caused not only by the application of
an external force, but also can be self—excited due to effects speciﬁc to dusty plasmas. For example, a drastic increase
in the amplitude of vertical oscillations was examined experimentally under certain conditions (e.g., with lowering
pressure) in the sheath of if and dc discharges [230—232]. In some cases, energy of these oscillations exceeds the
room temperature (which particles would have if only the collisions with neutrals are present) by orders of magnitude.
Different theoretical aspects of the enhanced vertical oscillations were considered in Refs. [132,133,137].

The possible energy source for the enhanced vertical oscillations is associated with random variations of the particle
charge [132,133,137]. To describe this effect, one should include the random deviation of the particle charge, Z1(t),

NOW the oscillation amplitude is a random function of time. Using the stochastic properties of the charge ﬂuctuations
(see Section 3.5 ), it can be easily shown that for typical conditions vdn < 9V < Qch the mean energy ofvertical oscillations
associated With the random force at the right-hand side of Eq. (60) saturates at [132—134]

as it follows from the ﬂuctuation—dissipation theorem. In accordance With Eq. (29), the relative charge dispersion (due
to charge discreteness) is 022 ~ |Z |_1. The neutral damping rate scales With gas pressure as vdn QC [9, so that the mean
energy decreases as (5V) oc p‘1.N0te also that, since Qch oc a, vdn oc 61—1, and |Z| oc a, we have (5V) oc a2 QC ”131/3,
i.e., the mean energy of oscillations increases With the particle mass. For typical experimental conditions the energy can
be of the order of a few eV or even higher. In addition to this “heating”, the charge variations can trigger the parametric
instability of the oscillations [137], due to the random variations of the oscillation frequency in Eq. (60). Then the mean
energy grows With time exponentially, provided the friction is low enough,

VanUZ V/ ch- ( )
Note, however, that if the charge variations are due to the discreteness of plasma charges then the magnitude of the
dispersion is fairly small and the instability is only possible at pressures far below ~1 Pa.

"49","VE. Forlov el al. /Physz'cs Reports 42] (2005) I —103 49

Another effect as sociated with the variability of the particle charge results from the ﬁnite charging time. The qualitative
theory of this effect was proposed in Ref. [230] to describe the following experimental evidence, and the quantitative
theory was derived in Ref. [137]: due to the ﬁnite charging time, the charge of the oscillating particle experiences some
delay with respect to its equilibrium local value which is a function of height h. The particle motion is not potential
in this case. For a particle moving downwards (along the electric ﬁeld) the absolute value of the momentary charge
is smaller than the equilibrium value, and the opposite is for the particle moving upwards. Thus, the work done over
the oscillation period by the electric force is always positive—the particle acquires energy from the electric ﬁeld. The
oscillations become unstable when the energy gain is higher than the energy dissipation due to friction—the instability
condition practically coincides with Eq. (61).

8.3. Dynamics ofensembles with Spatially varying charges

As has been pointed out by Zhakhovskii et al. [233], the very fact that the particle charge depends on the spatial
coordinates immediately implies that the energy of particles in external electric ﬁelds is not conserved. This is because
the electrostatic force is no longer potential, V X F61: eVZ X E and, hence, the work done over a closed path is generally
not equal to zero [473]. (Obviously, the work is zero only when the path is degenerated into a line, i.e., when the motion
is one-dimensional.) The sign of the work depends on the direction of motion along the path, so that when the positive
energy gain over the vortex cycle is balanced by the frictional dissipation one can expect the formation of stationary
ﬂow patters in the particle cloud. Vaulina et al. [234,235] suggested that this mechanism can be responsible for the
formation of vortices in complex plasmas. The vortex structures are almost ubiquitous in complex plasma experiments
(see Fig. 3) and usually are observed at the periphery of the particle clouds. Presumably, the discharge parameters and
hence the grain charge are nonuniform in these regions, which makes charge gradient mechanism favorable for the
explanation of the vortices.

One should note that, in addition to the electrostatic force, also the ion drag force can be a reason for the vortex
formation in complex plasmas. Indeed, by rewriting the ion drag in the following functional form: Fid = a(E2)E
(assuming that the ion drift velocity is parallel to the electric ﬁeld E, see Section 7.1) we immediately conclude that
VXFid=VocXE7EO.

8.4. Complex plasmas as non-Hamiltonian systems

Thus, one of the remarkable features distinguishing complex (dusty) plasmas from usual plasmas is that charges on
the grains are not constant, but ﬂuctuate in time around some equilibrium value which, in turn, is some function of
spatial coordinates. Complex plasmas are a novel type of non-Hamiltonian systems where the energy of the particle
ensemble is not conserved due to the charge variations. This is the generic feature of such systems—the energy varies
not only in the presence of external electric ﬁelds, but also due to mutual particle collisions.

Non-Hamiltonian systems cannot be described in terms of thermodynamic potentials. An appropriate way to investi-
gate their evolution is to employ the kinetic approach. The most general and simple way to understand generic features
of the ensembles with variable charges is to study the case when no external forces are present and the energy of
particles changes solely due to mutual collisions. Recently, the two cases were studied [236,237,474]: inhomogeneous
charge—Z depends on the particle coordinate but does not change in time, and ﬂuctuating charge—Z randomly varies
in time around the equilibrium value which is constant in space. For both cases the Fokker—Planck approach was em-
ployed to derive the collision integral which describes the momentum and energy transfer in mutual particle collisions
as well as in the collisions with neutrals. It was shown that the mean particle energy exhibits the explosion-like growth
when the neutral friction is below a certain threshold. The analysis of the threshold conditions suggests that while the
instability caused by the ﬂuctuating charges cannot cause the heating of complex plasmas under typical experimental
conditions [237], the instability due to inhomogeneous charges can certainly be a reason for such heating [236]. The
obtained solutions can also be of signiﬁcant importance for space plasma environments. For instance, such mechanisms
might operate in protoplanetary disks and affect dust dynamics and the kinetics of the planet formation.

One more example of non-Hamiltonian dynamics is associated with the presence of ion wakes: as we discussed in
Section 4.2, a charged particle embedded into a ﬂowing plasma induces the charge polarization along the ﬂow, because
the ions focus downstream the particle—they form the wake. The overall charge of the wake is opposite to the particle
charge and therefore it always exerts the electrostatic force on the particle pointed along the ﬂow—the ion drag force.

"
"50","50 VE. Forlov el al. /Physz'cs Reports 42] (2005) 1—103

The electric ﬁeld produced by the wake of a test particle acts also on the neighbouring particles. The remarkable feature
of the wakes is that the interaction of the neighbouring particle with the wake of the test particle does not affect the test
particle, as was clearly shown in experiment [174]. Therefore, the interaction between two particles is nonreciprocal
and, hence, is non-Hamiltonian. The energy of such ensembles is not conserved, which can be a reason for various
instabilities [238,239] (see also Section 9.4.4). Also, the particle—wake interaction can change the equilibrium particle
conﬁgurations—it is the reason for the formation of vertical particle strings [238] (see also Section 10.3) or the particle
pairing [240—242].

9. Waves and instabilities in complex plasmas

The charged dust grains embedded into plasmas not only change the electron—ion composition and thus affect
conventional wave modes (e.g., ion—acoustic waves), but also introduce new low-frequency modes associated with
the microparticle motion, alter dissipation rates, give rise to instabilities, etc. Moreover, the particle charges vary in
time and space (see Section 8), which results in important qualitative differences between complex plasmas and usual
multicomponent plasmas. Depending on the magnitude of the interparticle coupling, complex plasmas can be in a
weakly coupled (gaseous-like) or strongly coupled (liquid-like) states, and form crystalline structures (see Section 10).
This gives us a unique opportunity to investigate wave phenomena occurring in different phase states—in particular,
nonlinear waves—at the kinetic level.

Complex plasmas observed in laboratory or space experiments usually form strongly coupled liquid or crystalline
states. Uncorrelated gaseous-like phase can be seen when there is a strong energy inﬂux into the sub-system of grains,
which causes substantial increase of the grain temperature and, hence, decrease of the coupling. This heating can be
due to the spatial and/or temporal charge variations (as discussed in Section 8), or induced by dust wave instabilities
triggered in complex plasmas (as discussed below in Sections 9.2.2 and 9.4.4). At the same time, for ideal plasmas the
theoretical analysis of the wave modes and major instabilities can be performed in the most simple form. Therefore
we ﬁrst consider major wave properties of gaseous complex plasmas, and then discuss features peculiar to the waves
in strongly coupled plasmas.

The comprehensive kinetic approach to study waves in complex plasmas is accompanied by serious difﬁculties: one
has to deal with the dust—dust and dust—ion collision integrals which, in contrast to usual plasmas, cannot be considered
in the linear approximations for realistic experimental conditions. Also, the grain charge should be treated as a new
independent variable in the kinetic equation, which makes the calculations much more complicated. There have been a
series of publications where the substantial progress in the self—consistent kinetic theory of complex plasmas has been
achieved [243—247]. One should admit, however, that this problem is still far from being solved. On the other hand,
in many cases the (relatively) simple hydrodynamic approach based on the analysis of the ﬂuid equations allows us
to catch essential physics of the processes and, hence, to understand maj or dynamical properties of complex plasmas.
Therefore, the analysis of maj or wave modes and instabilities can be done with the ﬂuid model. Of course, in some cases
the applicability of the results of the hydrodynamic approach have certain limitations, especially where the damping
and/or the growth rates of the modes are concerned, and then the kinetic approach has to be employed.

In this section we ﬁrst brieﬂy describe different experimental techniques used to excite the waves, and then discuss
in detail the wave properties of complex plasmas in gaseous, liquid, and crystalline states.

9.]. Wave excitation technique

The methods used for the wave excitation in complex plasmas conditionally diVide the experiments into two cate-
gories: passive and active. The former employ “natural” perturbations which are triggered spontaneously (e.g., wave
instabilities [231,248—253], see Sections 9.2.2, 9.4.4, and 9.5.2, or Mach cones [254,255], see Section 9.5.3), whereas
the latter use methods of controlled action produced with the specially designed devices. Generally, the active exper-
iments provide much better ﬂexibility, but in some particular cases the passive experiments yield remarkably good
results (e.g., natural spectrum of waves in plasma crystals [25 6—25 8], see Section 9.4.2).

The methods of the active (controlled) wave excitation in complex plasmas are very diverse. First of all, this can
be the electrical action produced in plasmas with biased Langmuir probes [107,259—261], wires [102,199,262—266],
or electrodes [76,77,267—270], which allows the excitation of both ion and dust waves. The electrical methods are

"
"51","VE. Forlov el al. /Physz'cs Reports 421 (2005) 1—103 51
very effective in creating waves of large amplitude and arbitrary geometry (see Section 9.5). On the other hand, the
maj 0r drawback of these methods is that the electrical perturbations cannot be localized in small regions, and that this
action can strongly affect global plasma parameters [199]. To produce the local action on dust particles Which does
not affect the discharge plasma, the laser radiation is the most Widely used method [108—111,271—276]. This method
is employed for manipulation by single particles and small particle sets, and allows us to excite the Coulomb cluster
rotation (see Section 12.1), vertical oscillations of individual particles (see Section 8.1) and low-frequency waves in
plasma crystals (see Section 9.4), and to generate Mach cones (see Section 9.5.3). This technique, however, requires
very high laser power When waves of large amplitude are needed (e.g., Mach cones, solitons, etc. [271,274,276]),
or when the perturbation should be simultaneously produced over an extended area (e.g., to excite planar waves in
three-dimensional plasmas). The alternative method Which provides local action on microparticles and, at the same
time, the suiﬁcient strength of the perturbations is the use of the electron beams [277,278]. Recently, this method was
successfully employed to cause local excitation, melting, and disruption ofplasma crystals, by changing the magnitude
of the beam current. This technique, however, requires further development to be Widely used in complex plasma
experiments.

Other methods of action on the microparticles in complex plasmas employ external magnetic ﬁelds [200—202]
(see Section 13) and perturbations of a neutral gas pressure (density) [279,280] (see Section 9.5.2).
9.2. Waves in ideal (gaseous) complexplasmas
Considering the dust species as an ideal gas, one can write the continuity and momentum equations for the dust
density nd and velocity Vd in the following form:
62 + V(ndVd) = 0 9 (62)
61
6%: + (Vd - V)Vd = —%V¢ — 31+? — 2/3: Vdﬁ(Vd — V3) - (63)
The 1astterm in Eq. (63) describes the momentum transfer force (“drag”) on the dust particles caused by the collisions
With the “light” species—electrons, ions, and neutrals (ﬂ = e, i, n). The corresponding momentum exchange rates
derived in the binary collision approximation, Vd/g, are given in Section 6.2. As long as the ﬂow velocities of the light
species are much smaller than the thermal velocities, Vd/g does not depend 011 v3. An important difference between the
drag force due to collisions With neutrals (“neutral drag”) and the force caused by the collisions With the charged species
(“ion drag” and “electron drag”) is that the latter includes both the direct collisions With the grain surface (“collecti0n”
part) and elastic scattering by the grain electrostatic potential (“0rbita1” part), i.e., le§ 2 1232311 —|— v3? The dust Viscosity
usually does not play noticeable role in the gaseous phase and therefore is not included in Eq. (63).
The ﬂuid equations for electrons and ions are (ac = e, i)
6mC
a ‘1’ V(nocVoc) = QIoc — QLoc — Iocnd 9 (64)
2% + (v. . m = fﬁw — EL? — g vzgm. — vm — (Q— + v2.2”) v0. . <65)
The continuity equations include source terms, Q1“, and two types of sink—“discharge” loss QLOC and the “dust” loss
land. The source of electrons and ions Which sustains the discharge is usually the volume ionization in electron-neutral
collisions [83,215], and then Q16 2 Qli = vlne, Where v1 is the ionization frequency. (In some cases the secondary,
thermal, and/or photoemission from the surface of the grains can also provide contributions to Q16, see Section 3.3).
The “discharge” loss term is usually due to the diffusion towards the discharge chamber walls and can be estimated
as QLe = QLi ~ (Dai /L2)ni, Where Dai is the ambipolar (ion) diffusion coefﬁcient and L is the spatial scale of the
“global” plasma inhomogeneity (i.e., distance between the if electrodes or the radius of the dc discharge tube). The
“dust” loss terms are due to electron and ion absorbtion 0n the grain surface (see Section 3.4) and are determined by
the corresponding ﬂuxes on a grain, I“, described in Section 3.

"
"52","52 VE. Forlov el al. /Physz'cs Reports 421 (2005) 1—103
The representation of the momentum transfer force in the form V“); (V0C — V3) is valid as long as the mean free path of
the species is shorter then the spatial scale of the perturbations (e.g., the inverse wave vector k‘l). Note that the change
of the electron or ion momentum due to absorbtion by the dust grains does not depend on the grain velocity, and this
is also taken into account in Eq. (65). The reciprocal momentum transfer rates are related to each other as follows:
manava/g = mﬁnﬁvﬁa . (66)
Variability of the grain charges implies that the ﬂuid equations for the density and momentum should be coupled to the
charge transport equation Which has the following form:
©Z
—+Vd-VZ=I,-—Ie. (67)
or
The system of equations is closed by the Poisson equation,
Vng = —47Ie(n,- — ne —|— an) . (68)
One can also take into account the temperature variation of the species caused by the wave perturbations. There are two
limiting cases: isothermal variations—When the time scale of the perturbations exceeds the time scale of temperature
relaxation due to the thermal conductivity—and adiabatic variations in the opposite case. Then the partial pressure of
each species, naToc, scales as o< n36“, Where ya is the effective polytropic index.
9.2.]. Major wave modes
In ideal unniagnetized plasmas only longitudinal wave modes can be sustained. The dispersion relations of these
modes can be written as a sum of the partial susceptibilities (plasma responses),
8(co,k)=1+xe+xi+xd=0, (69)
Where the electron and ion responses are expressed Via density and potential perturbations as Xe,i = i4nek‘25nm /5gb.
The dust response depends also on the charge variations, so that xd = —477:k_2(Z5nd —|— nd5Z) /5gb. By linearizing Eqs.
(62)—(68) one can obtain the partial responses in general case (for the results of the kinetic theory, see. e.g., [281,282]).
In order to retrieve the wave Inodes existing in complex plasmas, let us ﬁrst consider the case of the multicomponent
plasmaS—When the variations of the grain charges are neglected. At this point we also neglect collisions and assume
the equilibrium plasma ionization and loss: this approach allows us to obtain satisfactory results for the real part of
the dispersion relations a)(k), unless the actual damping (growth) rate of the waves is comparable With a). The partial
plasma responses in this case are

waves (plasmons With a) > vae) the microparticles remain at rest and, therefore, the functional form of the dispersion
relation, (oz = case —|— 3k2vi, is not affected by the presence of the dust grains (in the hydrodynamic approach one
can treat plasma waves as one-dimensional oscillations With ye = 3). However, the electron plasma frequency, cope, is
changed because the charged grains affect the quasineutrality condition for unperturbed densities, n ,- = ne —|— Z nd, and
hence the electron density. A similar effect is also observed for the ion—acoustic (IA) waves, Where the electrons provide

The ﬁrst term represents ordinary ion thermal sound mode Which can eXist When the ion mean free path is much smaller
than the wavelength k‘l. Usually this term is relatively small and can be neglected compared to the second term, Which

"53","VE. Forlov el al. /Physz'cs Reports 421 (2005) 1—103 53
actually represents the IA mode. This IA term depends on the ion-to-electron density ratio, which can be conveniently
characterized by the “Haynes parameter” [283],

P = Q E ""—‘ — 1 , (72)

”e ”6

Generally, when P <1 the effect of dust on the conventional (plasma and ion—acoustic) modes can be neglected.
Otherwise, for P Z 1 the role of dust can be signiﬁcant and then, in order to highlight this effect, the IA waves are
referred to as the dust ion—acoustic (DIA) mode. In the long-wavelength limit k/iDe < 1 the phase velocity of the DIA
mode can be conveniently written as

CDIA = wpi/lDe E V (1 + P)TUT,- 9 (73)
where t = Te / T,- is the electron-to-ion temperature ratio, which is much larger than unity for typical rf and dc discharges,
so that CD1 A exceeds signiﬁcantly the ion thermal velocity (note that CD1 A does not depend on T,). The role of the dust
species on the IA waves was ﬁrst considered by Shukla and Silin [284]. The DIA waves were studied in a series of
experiments (see, e.g., Refs. [268,285 ,286]) where the increase of the phase velocity with the grain density was clearly
demonstrated.

Charged dust particles give rise to another acoustic mode associated with the motion of charged grains, whereas both
the electrons and ions provide equilibrium neutralizing background. For vad < a) <vai we have Xe,i = (k/iDeJ-YZ,
and then Eqs. (69) and (70) yield

k2 yd de + 1 + 1ng ’ (74)
where 2132 = 2133 —|— 2131.2 is the linearized Debye length. In analogy with the DIA waves [Eq. (71)], the ﬁrst term
represents the dust thermal mode and the second one corresponds to the dust—acoustic (DA) mode. The phase velocity
of the DA mode does not depend on the dust temperature and in the long-wavelength limit k/iD < 1 can be written as

A _ T,- Pt

CDA—wpd D= IZIT—d —1+(1+P)rde' (75)
There is a clear similarity between the ion and dust acoustic modes: Eqs. (73) and (75) show that the phase velocity
of both modes is determined by the temperature ratio of the light-tO-heavy species—Te / T,- for DIA waves and T,- / Td
for DA waves. Peculiarity 0f the DA waves is that the charge-to—niass ratio of the dust grains is typically 108—1010
times smaller than that of the ions and, therefore, the dust waves have relatively low frequencies, ~10—100 Hz. The
dispersion relation for the DA wave was ﬁrst derived by Rao et al. [287]. Since the typical values of |Z l are of the
order of thousands, the phase velocity of DA waves can be much larger than de, even if Td exceeds T,- (of course, the
Haynes parameter should not be too small).

The ﬁrst reported observation of spontaneously excited dust waves was in a rf magnetron discharge at a frequency
2 12 Hz [248]. Later on the dust waves, either self—sustained 0r excited externally, were seen in numerous experiments
under quite different experimental conditions: for example, in Q-rnachine at 2 15 Hz with the phase velocity 2 9 crn/s
[249], in do discharges in the range 2 6—30 Hz with the phase velocity 2 12 cm/s [267,268], and at 2 60 Hz with the
phase velocity 2 1 crn/s [250,251], in rf discharges at 2 25—60 Hz [252,253], and at 2 8—40 Hz [76,77], etc. Fig. 24
shows the waves excited by a periodic modulation of the rf electrode potential obtained under microgravity conditions
[77]. Most of such experiments, however, were done with strongly coupled plasmas. The weak coupling was probably
achieved only when the excitation amplitude was fairly large (e.g., as seen in Fig. 24) or the waves were unstable (e.g.,
[249]), which eventually provided suiﬁciently high “temperature” of grains. A quantitative comparison with the linear
dispersion relations is not really justiﬁed in these cases. Therefore, an accurate experiment to verify the DA dispersion
relation in gaseous complex plasmas is still necessary, though the ﬁrst experimental observations of the dust therrnal
mode was recently reported [258].

Fig. 24. Wave structures observed in PKE-Nefedov experiments [77]. The experiments were performed under microgravity conditions in argon
rf-discharge plasma at pressure 12 Pa with a mixture of the melamine formaldehyde particles of 3.4 and 6.8 mm diameter. The particles were
Visualized by the vertical laser sheet of about 150 mm thickness. The waves were excited by applying a low-frequency modulation voltage to the
horizontal rf electrodes. The snapshots (side View) show the response of the particles at frequencies (a) 3.3 Hz, (b) 10 Hz, and (c) 22 Hz.

Note that when the variations of the grain charges induced by waves are taken into account the DIA phase velocity
remains the same, but the DA velocity is changed [251,288,289]. However, this change does not exceed the factor
2 ,/ (2 + z) / (1 + z) compared to Eq. (75), which is typically less than 2 15%. Therefore, for practical use Eq. (75) is
quite sufﬁcient.

9.2.2. Damping and instabilities of the BIA and DA mode

The wave modes can only eXist when the damping is weak, so that the actual imaginary part of the dispersion relation,
|wil, is much smaller than the real part cor—only then one can speak about the wave propagation. The waves can also
be unstable, because of various mechanisms operating in complex plasmas—we discuss these mechanisms below. As
long as |wi| is much smaller than cor, the latter is approximately determined by the real part of the permittivity (69),
i.e., Re 8(0)“ k) 2 0, and the former is given by [147]

N Im 8(a), k)
601 _ 0Re8(a), k)/0w|w=wr '
This is very convenient formula for the practical use.

First we discuss the kinetic effects—namely, the role of the Landau damping.

For each wave mode, the Landau damping can be due to wave resonance with “heavy” species (i.e., ions for DIA
waves and dust for DA waves) and with “light” species (electrons for DIA waves and ions for DA waves). The damping
caused by heavy species scales as |wi/wrl o< eXp(— %C 2 / 1%), where C and UT are the corresponding phase velocity and
the thermal velocity of heavy species, respectively [213,290]. From Eqs. (73) and (75) we see that even in isothermal
complex plasmas the C / vT ratios can be quite large: CDIA/vTi is large when P > 1, and CDA/de is large because
|Z | > 1. This makes substantial difference compared to usual plasmas, where CIA/le. can be large and, thus, the IA
waves can propagate only when t>1 (DIA waves were studied in the double plasma device, e.g., [260], and the
Q-machine, e.g. [285], where t 2 1). Thus, the damping on heavy species is usually small in (dense) complex plasmas.

In the absence of the plasma ﬂows the Landau damping on light species is relatively weak as well, because of the
small charge-to-niass ratios: for DIA waves the (relative) damping rate is |wi/corl SA/ (1 —|— P)me / m i, whereas for DA
waves |wi/wrlfﬂ/ P(l —|— P)_1|Z|m,-/md [213,290]. Nevertheless, in experiments with the DIA waves performed at
very low pressures, 19 ~ 10—2—10_3 Pa, the electron Landau damping can be an important mechanisms of dissipation
[291]. For DA waves, however, it does not play noticeable role. The Landau damping is, of course, modiﬁed when a
stream of light species exists in a plasma (see below).

Now let us dwell upon the other mechanisms responsible for the damping and instabilities of the DIA and DA
waves. Below we assume that the electron-to-ion temperature ratio r is large, as it is usually in experiments. Such
assumption allows us to simplify fonnulas substantially (note that even for t 2 1 the resulting expressions yield fairly
good quantitative agreement with the exact formulas).

DIA mode. Along with the Landau damping the major dissipation mechanisms are the collisions with neutrals and
variations of the grain charges [289,292—295]. In addition, there is a counterplay between ionization and loss—this can
cause either damping or instability, depending on the value of P [204,296,297]. All three contributions to the imaginary
part coi (assuming that it is much smaller than cor) can be derived from the ﬂuid approach which yields

1 — P onch

26012 —V,'n — —V1 — — ,

1+P o+mo+o
where Vin is the frequency of the ion—neutral collisions and Qch is the charging frequency [see Eq. (15)]. In suﬂﬁciently
dense complex plasmas (when P > 1) the maj or damping mechanism can be due to the “coherent” charge variations
induced by waves (the mechanism is effective because the DIA frequency can be comparable to Qch). The ion—neutral
collisions as well as ionization do not usually play any signiﬁcant role in the DIA wave experiments, since the gas
pressure is low enough (see e.g., Refs. [260,269,285]).

As regards the DIA instabilities, the major mechanism operating in experiments is associated with the electron
drift relative to ions [286,298]—the so-called “current—driven instability” which is well-known for the IA waves in
usual plasmas. Essentially, this instability is the reversed electron Landau damping—the energy exchange due to the
resonance electron-wave interaction changes the sign when the drift velocity ue exceeds the phase velocity of the DIA
waves CDIA. The growth rate associated with this instability can be estimated as [290]

g 2 /3 E(1 + P) (Me/CDIA — 1).

cor 8 m,- (1 + kZAZDef/Z
When the damping rates discussed above (including the ion Landau damping) are low enough the current-driven
instability sets on [268,298]. The charge variations can somewhat modify the growth rate [299].

DA wave mode. The maj or damping mechanism operating in experiments with complex plasmas is certainly neutral
gas friction. The resulting damping, 2coi 2 —vdn, is determined by the corresponding momentum exchange rate [see
Eq. (48)]. However, along with the damping there are a number of instability mechanisms which turn out to be quite
important in experiments. Below we mention the most important types of the DA instability:

(i) Ion streaming instability: It can be triggered when ion currents are present in a plasma (e.g., due to electric
ﬁelds in if sheaths and dc striations). The mechanism of the (DA) ion streaming instability is completely identical
to that of the (DIA) current-driven instability. The ion streaming instability is often observed in complex plasma
experiments performed in different discharges (see, e.g., [3 6,249,25 0]), and it has been studied theoretically in numerous
publications, e.g., [290,300—304].

The presence of the ion ﬂux modiﬁes properties of the DA mode. This can be appropriately taken into account by
using the kinetic expression for the ion susceptibility. Also, the kinetic approach allows us to include properly the
effect of the ion—neutral collisions: the collisions in discharges are mostly of the charge-exchange type, which makes
possible to employ the model BGK form of the ion collision integral. Assuming Shifted Maxwellicm distribution, the
ion response is [147]

a) — k - ui —|— ivm
where 97(5) is the Maxwellian dispersion function [216]. In limiting cases Eq. (76) can be substantially simpliﬁed: for
lél < 1, the power series for the dispersion function is 97(5) 2 —252 + iﬁf, and for lél > 1 the asymptotic expansion
is 97(5) 2 —1 — %§_2 + iﬁée‘éz. Therefore, when la) — k - ui —|— ivinl <vai we obtain
( k)2 1 1 ,fco—k-ui 77
X‘w’ _<kzD,->2i +1 2 kvn i < )
where ui is the drift velocity of ions. The real part in Eq. (77) coincides with the results of the ﬂuid approach in this
limit [see Eq. (70)], the imaginary part is due to the Landau damping. In the opposite limit la) — k - ui —|— ivml >vai
the resulting susceptibility can be written in the following form:
k N 601%;- 78
mm), )_ (co—k-ui)(a)—k-u,-+ivin)—k2v%i ( )
This limit denotes either strongly collisional case (when the ion mean free path is shorter than k‘l) or the case of
“cold hydrodynamics” (when ui > le. , so that the thermal motion can be neglected). In both cases the ﬂuid approach
is applicable and, hence, Eq. (78) can be directly obtained from Eqs. (64) and (65), assuming equilibrium ioniza-
tion/recombination and neglecting other collisions.

Note that Eq. (76) is derived assuming the shifted Maxwellian function for the ion velocity distribution. This
assumption, however, is only justiﬁed when the ion ﬂow is subthernial—otherwise deviations from the Maxwellian
form become too strong [see Eq. (53)] which, in turn, strongly affects the expression for the ion susceptibility Xi-
Therefore, for the superthermal ﬂow one should use Eq. (54) [99,210,211].

The threshold for the ion streaming instability is determined from the (numerical) solution of Eq. (69), by using
Eqs. (77) or (78) for the ion response and substituting Xe 2 (k/1De)_2 and Xd 2 —c01%d/co(a) —|— ivdn). Experiments
show that by increasing the neutral gas pressure up to sufﬁciently high values (typically, dozens of Pa) the instability
can be suppressed, apparently because the neutral gas friction increases as well. The theoretical analysis (which can
be somewhat simpliﬁed for the subthermal [251] and superthermal [305] limits of the ion drift) yields the pressure
threshold which is in a good agreement with the experiments.

(ii) Ionization instability: Unlike the DIA waves, ionization cannot directly cause the instability of the DA waves—
because the ionization creates new ions, but not dust grains. Nevertheless, ionization can in fact trigger the DA instability,
because the ions can effectively transfer their momentum to the grains Via the ion drag force [203,204,306]. The whole
instability mechanism operates as follows: when the dust density ﬂuctuates in some region—say, decreases—ionization
increases (because the electron density grows keeping quasineutrality), which creates additional ion outﬂow from the

region. This ﬂux exerts an additional ion drag force pushing the grains away and, thus, the dust density decreases
further. Obviously, this instability is of the aperiodic type (i.e., cor = 0) and, thus, is independent of vdn. The instability
condition coi > 0 is satisﬁed when [203,204,297]

Here, vid is the effective frequency of the ion—dust collisions, which is related to the “ion drag” rate vdl- introduces
in Section 6.2.2 Via minivid = mdndvdi. The larger the dust grains are, the higher the value of vid is and, hence, the
condition for the instability is more relaxed. There are grounds to believe that this instability is responsible for the onset
of the void formation in complex plasmas [22,203,204,297,306].

(iii) Charge variation instability: It is due to the grain charge variations induced by the DA wave. In contrast to the
DIA waves, now the charges are very close to the momentary equilibrium (because |co| < Qch) and, therefore, their
variations alone are unlikely to be a reason for an instability 0r damping. However, in the presence of an external electric
ﬁeld E (e.g., aInbipolar ﬁelds or the ﬁelds in if sheaths and dc striations) the wave—correlated charge variations result in
non—zero (average) work done by the electric force [251—253]. The sign of this work is determined by the orientation
of the wave vector k with the respect to the electric ﬁeld. The dust susceptibility that takes into account these effects
is [251]

601%,; ieE - k
X.(w,k>:__.[1+_,] .
a)(w + lvdn) (1 + Z)Tik
This expression should be used together with Eq. (77) or (78) for the ﬂowing ions, because the electric ﬁeld causes
an ion drift with a velocity which is usually determined by the ion mobility ,ui, Via Mi 2 ,ul-E. Numerical solution
of Eq. (69) yields the instability threshold which takes into account both the ion stream and the charge variations
[251]. It was shown that the charge variations can relax the conditions for the instability onset signiﬁcantly, resulting
into lower values of the threshold pressure. Then the instability can be triggered when the density of dust particles
exceeds a critical value [251,252]. Fig. 25 shows an example of such instability observed in a if inductively coupled
discharge [252].

9.3. Waves in strongly coupled (liquid) complex plasmas

In the beginning of this section we already mentioned that complex plasmas are normally observed in experiments
forming strongly coupled states, i.e., the coupling parameter of the grain—grain interaction F is quite large. The pair
correlation function ofniicroparticles usually eXhibits short-range order indicating that plasmas are in liquid-like states,
or that the particles form ordered crystalline structures. Dispersion properties of strongly coupled plasmas signiﬁcantly
deviate from those of ideal gaseous plasmas discussed above. There are number of different theoretical approaches to
study waves in strongly coupled systems: these are, e.g., the “quasilocalized charge approximation” [307] employed for
complex plasmas by Rosenberg and Kalman [308,309], the “multicomponent kinetic approach” by Murillo [310,311],
and the “generalized hydrodynamic approach” applied by KaW and Sen [312—314]. The latter is probably the most
physically “transparent” approach Which allows us to track evolution of the dispersion properties of complex plasmas
in a broad range of F, from the ideal gaseous state up to the strongly coupled state—When the system crystallizes.
There have been also numerical MD simulations of the wave modes in strongly coupled complex plasmas [315,316],
Which are in reasonably good agreement With the results of the above mentioned theoretical approaches.

Following the model of “very Viscous liquids” originally proposed by Maxwell and generalized by Frenkel [317],
in the framework of generalized hydrodynamics (GH) the ensemble of strongly coupled dust grains is treated as a
continuous medium Which reveals properties of Viscous liquids in response to slow perturbations, but behaves as elastic
body When the perturbation time scales are short enough [312,313]. The transition between these two regimes occurs
at the so-called “Maxwellian relaxation time” ”CM. The ﬂuid equation of motion for the velocity perturbation 5Vd has
the following form:

t
65$ = —£V¢ — m — vdnavd —/ dt’f dr’nd(r — r’, z — z’)5vd(r’, z’) . (79)
at md mdnd —oo
The integral term is the linear Viscoelastic operator in a homogeneous stationary medium written in a general form. It
takes into account both spatial and temporal correlations of stresses exerted in strongly-coupled systems, in addition to
the local homogeneous stress—the pressure term o< Vpd. By using the simplest form of the Viscoelastic operator With
the exponentially decaying memory effects, we have for the Fourier transform of the dust kinematic Viscosity,
2 1

Parameters of the stress operator—Viscosities 17 and C and relaxation time ”CM, as well as pressure pd are determined by the
correlation part of the energy of the electrostatic interaction, M (F, K) = U001.r / Td (normalized by the dust temperature).
In a weakly coupled regime, F S, 1, the Debye—Hiickel approximation yields u 2 —§F3/2 (here and below in this
section F corresponds to the Wigner—Seitz radius). For the liquid phase in the range 1 S, F $200 the normalized
correlation energy can be well approximated by the scaling [318] u = aF —|— bF1/4 —|— c —|— d F ‘1/4, Where coeiﬁcients a,
b, c, and d are some functions of the lattice parameter K. In the one-component plasma (OCP) limit, K = 0, the Monte
Carlo (MC) simulations [319] yield: a 2 —0.89, b 2 0.94, c 2 —0.80, and d 2 0.18. For K S, 1 the dependence of
the coeiﬁcients 0n the lattice parameter is rather weak [318], e.g., 6100 2 —0.89—0.10K2 —|— 0.0025K4 —|— - - -, Which
means that the OCP results are quite applicable for this range of K. The relaxation time is expressed as follows [320]:

simulations and experiments [321—324].

Using the Fourier transfonnation of Eq. (79) together With the continuity equation (62) one can derive the dispersion

relations of different wave modes.

Fig. 26. Dispersion relation of dust waves in strongly coupled complex plasmas, as derived from the quasilocalized charge approximation [308]. The
frequency is normalized to the dust plasma frequency copay and the wave vector is normalized to the particle separation A (in the text A is adopted).
The results are shown for K E A / 1D = 0.5 and different values of the coupling parameter F. The curve F = 0 represents the dispersion relation for
the DA waves in gaseous complex plasmas [Eq. (74) with Td = O].
The dispersion relation is determined by Eq. (69) by substituting Xe,i 2 (k/tDe, 13—2 together with Eq. (80). Naturally,
two limits can be distinguished: the “hydrodynamic regime” (01M <1 and the “strongly coupled regime” (01M >1
(following the terminology adopted from the OCP literature). For F > 1 the correlation energy is mostly determined by
the Madelung part, u 2 —0.89F, and then the results are reduced to the following simple form:

The right-hand side of Eq. (81) is independent of Td, and the second terms represent the “coupling correction” to the
gaseous DA dispersion relation (74). At suiﬁciently large F these terms play a very important role—the dispersion can
even change the sign, so that the group velocity becomes negative (Gw/Gk < 0) at large k. This feature is peculiar to the
longitudinal modes in plasma crystals (see Section 9.4), which indicates that there is no qualitative difference between
the dispersion properties of (strongly coupled) liquid and crystalline complex plasmas. It is noteworthy that the other
approaches yield essentially the same results for the real part of the dispersion relation (see Fig. 26). The important
difference revealed in the GH approach is only for the imaginary part—in addition to the neutral friction, the Viscosity
contributes to the dissipation in the hydrodynamic regime. However, for typical experimental conditions the neutral
gas friction prevails and the Viscosity can provide the maj 0r contribution to the dissipation only if the gas pressure is
low enough. Also, the neutral gas friction can hamper the role of the “coupling correction”, and when vdn becomes
comparable to copd the difference between the dispersion relations of ideal and strongly coupled complex plasmas can
be washed away completely [308,312,313]. Presumably, that was the reason why in experiments where the coupling
parameter was quite high the dispersion properties were nevertheless found to be very similar to those derived for ideal

plasmas (see, e.g., [262]). Note that the longitudinal waves in strongly coupled plasmas are subject to the ion streaming
instability, similar to that discussed in Section 9.2.2, now With the thresholds and the growth rate functions of F
(e.g., [312]).
9.3.2. T ransverse waves

This mode is also strongly affected by the neutral gas friction—the effects of strong coupling disappear When vdn Z ”*kz.
If the neutral friction can be neglected then in the hydrodynamic regime (01M < 1 Eq. (82) reduces to the ordinary damped
mode for a shear ﬂow in Viscous liquids, a) 2 —i17*k2. In the opposite regime we obtain a nondispersive acoustic mode,
a) 2 . /17*/th, Which is analogous to elastic shear waves in solids. The phase velocity of the mode is determined by
the coupling parameter F,

The shear waves triggered in liquid complex plasmas due to instability have been observed experimentally [325]
(however, the mechanism responsible for the instability is not fully understood [313,325 ,326]).
Thus, the GH approach allows us to track evolution of the wave dispersion properties as the coupling parameter
F increases, and thus to cover the transition from the ideal gaseous to the strongly coupled state. However, the phe-
nomenological hydrodynamic approach can provide us only With the qualitative convergence to the wave modes in
crystals and, of course, cannot retrieve features peculiar to a particular lattice type (especially When the wavelength
becomes comparable to the interparticle distance). Therefore, for a quantitative study of waves in plasma crystals one
should employ different approach Which is discussed in the next section.
9.4. Waves in plasma crystals
The theoretical model of waves in crystals—the so-called “dust—lattice” (DL) waves—is based on the analysis of
the equation of motion for individual particles. For a particle having the coordinate r the equation of motion is
mdi: + mandnf = —VUdd + Fext - (83)
Here Udd = 62 Z 2:1- |r — rl- |_1 eXp(— |r — rl- | MD) is the total energy of the electrostatic dust—dust coupling (interaction
potential is assumed to be of the Debye—Hﬁckel form), the summation is over all particles With rl- 75 r. The force Fext
includes all “external” forces (except for the neutral drag force Which is explicitly included to the left-hand side), e.g.,
conﬁnement, excitation (lasers, electric pulses, beams, etc.), thermal noise (LangeVin force), etc. Such diversiﬁcation
of the forces is convenient because the eigenmodes of the system do not depend on Fem. When the particles in a
crystalline state are sufﬁciently far from the melting line (see Fig. 33, Section 10), as a “ﬁrst iteration” one can neglect
the inﬂuence of the thennal motion in the dispersion properties. Then the waves can be considered as perturbations of
cold particles Which form in the equilibrium an ideal lattice.
9. 4.1. One-dimensional string
The simplest model for studying waves in crystals is the one-dimensional “particle string” [327]. The motion is
only allowed along the string, Which formally corresponds to the inﬁnite transverse conﬁnement. In Ref. [328] this
model was adopted to study waves in plasma crystals. The string model shows very good agreement With the ﬁrst
experiments performed With one-dimensional plasma crystals [107,108]. Moreover, When particle separation A exceeds
the screening length 213, so that only the interaction With the nearest neighbours is important, the string model turns
out to be appropriate to describe DL waves also in two-dimensional plasma crystals [102,109]. The string model yields
the following dispersion relation in the nearest neighbour approximation:

Where QZDL = 62 Z2 / 14161213) is the DL frequency scale and K = A MD is the lattice parameter. The experimentally observed
wave frequencies usually vary from a few Hz for strings up to a few dozens of Hz for monolayers (e.g., [102,107,256]),
Which is in agreement With the estimated magnitude of QDL. Simple formula (84) is very convenient to evaluate spectra
of the longitudinal DL waves.
9.4.2. Two-dimensional triangle lattice

Most of the experiments on the DL waves have been performed so far in two-dimensional complex plasmas—
crystalline monolayers suspended in if electrode sheaths [102,109—1 l 1,256—25 8]. Particles in the monolayers form a
hexagonal (triangular) lattice (as shown in Fig. 34, see Section 10). The dispersion relation for the in-plane DL modes
in such lattices was derived in Refs. [257,329—331]. The perturbations are determined by the following equation [257]:
(0(0) —|— ivdn)5rw,k = Dw7k5rw7k, Where the components of the dynamics matrix are ijfk 2 oc — ﬂ, Dcyoyk 2 at —|— ﬂ, and
Dfoyk = Dcyjk = y, and the COCfﬁClCntS 0c, ﬂ, and y are represented by the following sums over all neighbours (m and n
are integers):

The dispersion relation for the in-plane DL modes is determined by the eigenvalues of the dynamics matrix,
601(601 + ivdn) = 06 i V 32 + 72 - (87)
The two branches, cot (k), represent the “high-frequency” and “low-frequency” modes, respectively. These modes are
shown in Fig. 27 for different orientations of the wave vector With respect to the lattice (i.e., different propagation
angle 6) [257]. In the long-wavelength limit branches mi (k) are isotropic. The dependence on the propagation angle
is only revealed at larger k, Where the dispersion can be negative (ow/ok < 0). Along With the theoretical curves and
the results of MD simulations (Fig. 27e—h), the experimental data are shown in Fig. 27a—d. The experimental results
were obtained by employing very effective technique proposed by Nunomura et al. [256]: instead of using external
excitation and measuring the particle response, the naturally excited (thermal) particle motion is recorded and a Fourier
transform of the velocities, Vahk, is computed. The highest values of the energy density, o< |Vw,k|2, are concentrated
in close proximity to distinct curves in (a), k)-space, Which are identiﬁed as dispersion curves.

One should be reminded here that a)(k) is completely deﬁned by the wave vectors from the ﬁrst Brillouin zone [327].
For a hexagonal lattice the ﬁrst zone is a hexagon determined by the basis reciprocal vectors A = 27t21_1 (l, f) and
B = 27t2|_1(0, ﬁ), Which corresponds to k<27t2|_1 for 6 = 00, and to kg %RA_1 for 6 = 300. Ifk is beyond the
ﬁrst zone then vector G = iA —|— jB (With some integer i and j) should be subtracted, so that k’ = k — G lies in the ﬁrst
zone and, thus, a)(k) is equal to a)(k’).

Branches mi (k) are often referred to as the “longitudinal” and “transverse” modes. Such a distinction, however, is
not always appropriate [25 7]: the branches are purely longitudinal and transverse only When the propagation angle is
6 = O0 and 300. Otherwise, for an arbitrary 6, the longitudinal polarization can be prescribed to 60+, and the transverse
one—to a)_ (i.e., perturbation 51103 is parallel or perpendicular to k, respectively) only When the wave vectors are
suiﬁciently small—in the long-wavelength limit. As k approaches the ﬁrst Brillouin zone the polarization of branches
mi (k) starts alternating between longitudinal and transverse, as shown in Fig. 27i—l. This is because for arbitrary 6 the
short—wavelength longitudinal perturbations cause the transverse ones, and Vice versa—the modes become coupled, so

thermally excited waves is shown, as measured (a)—(d) in experiments (argon gas pressure about 1Pa, plastic particles of 8.9 um diameter) and
(e)—(h) in MD simulations. The theoretical dispersion relations are superposed: dotted line for the high-frequency mode 60}, and dashed line for
the low-frequency mode a); (in the text (oi are adopted, respectively). The frequency is normalized to coo E 153/2 QDL and the wave vector is
normalized to the interparticle distance a (in the text A is adopted). (i) Phonon spectra of the waves propagating at 9 = 150 measured experimentally.
The high- and low-frequency branches have mixed longitudinal (L) and transverse (T) polarization. (1) Polarization of the high-frequency (Ph) and
low-frequency (Pl) modes predicted by the theory. In the long-wavelength limit the high-frequency mode is purely longitudinal (Ph 2 1), and the
low-frequency mode is purely transverse (P1 = O).
that one cannot distinguish between them. The coupling disappears only in “symmetrical” cases—When 6 = O0 and 300.
Thus, the more general division into the “high-frequency” and “low-frequency” branches seems to be more suitable.
Note that the one-dimensional dispersion relation for the particle string can be recovered from Eqs. (85)—(87) by
setting m = O. This corresponds to the summation along the primitive translation vector A (O, 1) (mode 60+ represents
perturbations parallel to the string, and mode a)_ is prohibited). It is remarkable that in the nearest neighbour ap-
proximation (K 2 2) and in the 10ng-wavelength limit, branch 60+ (k) almost coincides With Eq. (84) [255,257,330].
Moreover, for the propagation angle about 6 = 300 the high—frequency branch is well approximated by the string model
at any k.

In the long-wavelength limit the DL branches (which are purely longitudinal or transverse in this case) have an
acoustic dispersion, with the phase velocities (:11th = linik_>0 coi/ k (superscripts “1” and “t” denote the longitudinal
and transverse polarization, respectively). The velocities can be written as [329,331,332]

C};L = CDLFLKK) , (88)
where CéL 2 9211/1213 2 62 ZZ/md/lD is the DL velocity scale. The magnitude of CDL is of the order of a few cm/s for
typical experimental conditions [110,111]. In order to compare CDL with the phase velocity of DA waves in gaseous
complex plasmas, one can use the following convenient expression: CDL E x/K?’ /3(:’DA, where DDA is given by
Eq. (75) calculated for dust density fzd = (431771154. Exact formulas for functions F1,t(K), which can be derived from
Eqs. (85)—(87), are rather complicated. However, for a practical range of K the functions can be very well approximated
by simple polynomial expansions. For K g 5, we have with accuracy < 1% [329,332]:

F1 2 2.701e—10 — 0.096K — 0.00418), Ft 2 0.51K_1/2(1 — 0.03918) . (89)
Note that in the OCP regime (K < 1) the scaling of the longitudinal velocity with K as well as the magnitude of the
velocity (C113L 2 2.7K_1CDL) is different from the results for the one-dimensional string (C113L 2 1.4V —K—1 1n KCDL)
[331]. Recently, the long-wavelength DL modes in crystalline monolayers were investigated in active experiments
[110,111], where the waves were excited with chopped laser radiation. The measured dispersion relations were found
to be in remarkably good agreement with the theoretical results.

In addition to the in-plane waves, the particles in crystalline monolayers can also sustain the vertical (out-of—plane)
DL wave mode, which is shown in Fig. 28. The vertical mode is due to the balance between gravity and strongly
inhomogeneous vertical electric force on a particle (e.g., in rf sheaths). This implies the (lowest-order) vertical parabolic
conﬁnement characterized by the frequency of a single particle oscillations, 9V. Employing the one-dimensional string
model with parabolic transverse conﬁnement, one can derive dispersion relation for the vertical DL mode (nearest
neighbour approximation) [333]

(0(0) —|— ivdn) 2 £23, — 4Q%€_K(K_2 —|— K_3) sin2% kA . (90)
This is the optical branch, linik_>0 a) = 9V, which has a negative dispersion, so that the group and phase velocities
have opposite signs. An analytical dispersion relation for the vertical mode in a two-dimensional hexagonal lattice has
been derived in Refs. [266,334]. In the nearest neighbour approximation and in the long-wavelength limit, it agrees
well with Eq. (90). However, for k close to the ﬁrst Brillouin zone the dispersion of the two-dimensional vertical
mode becomes positive for any propagation angle, and then the vertical mode cannot be approximated by Eq. (90).
The theoretical dispersion relations are in reasonable agreement with the experimental results obtained for long waves
[266,275]. Nevertheless, deeper experimental investigations of the vertical DL mode (similar to what has been done
for the in-plane modes) are still required in order to perform comprehensive quantitative comparison with the theory.
9.4.3. T hree-dimensional plasma crystals

So far, no reliable experimental results on the DL waves in three-dimensional plasma crystals have been reported.
Basically, there are two reasons for that:

(i) The major problem of the wave investigation in three-dimensional complex plasmas is the lack of effective 3D
diagnostics. The laser sheets which are employed to render the particle motion cannot precisely reveal the information
(Viz., particle velocity) in the direction perpendicular to the sheet. The technique that is currently available for 3D
diagnostics (based on the particle color coding of the third dimension, see brief description in Ref. [335]) restricts
the analysis to a relatively small volume, and also is very complicated technically. Therefore, the major experimental
efforts (to study waves and other dynamical phenomena) have been focused so far of the crystalline monolayers.

(ii) In the ground—based experiments it is almost impossible to obtain 3D plasma crystals of “good quality”: The
particle clouds are very stressed in the vertical direction(un1ess the particles are small enough, but then their recognition
becomes diﬂcicult)—the inhomogeneity scale can be comparable to the particle separation (e.g., [19,21]). One can expect
that the plasma crystals produced under microgravity conditions will be in the most normal, isotropic, stress-free state
which can be obtained in complex plasmas. MicrograVity experiments will allow us to have a relatively small number
of dislocations in crystals, which is very important for the comparison with theory.

Fig. 28. Vertical DL waves observed in a monolayer hexagonal lattice [266]. Experiments were performed in a GEC rf chamber in argon gas at
pressure about 1—2 Pa, with plastic particles of 8.9 urn diameter. Particles were illuminated by a horizontal laser sheet of about 200—3 00 um thickness.
The waves were excited by applying a (negative) voltage pulse to the horizontal wire positioned at the left edge. Top View of the lattice is shown at
time 1.4—1.5 s after the excitation, when the wave packet was well formed. The particles are Visible only if they are in the plane of the illuminating
laser sheet. The stripes of particles apparently move from right to left due to the vertical wave motion, revealing the lines of constant phase. Individual
particles do not move horizontally. The numbers on the images indicate the frame number (at 230.75 fps).

Below we brieﬂy mention the main theoretical results for the DL waves in three-dimensional plasma crystals: The
number of acoustic modes which can be sustained in crystals is 3. Since the number of particles per elementary
lattice cell, r, can be more than one (e.g., r = 2 for bee and r = 3 for fee lattices), the remaining 3(r — 1) modes
have an optical dispersion (although these modes can be degenerate) [327]. In the long-wavelength limit, the phase
velocities of the (acoustic) modes are isotropic. When K<1 (OCP regime), the K-scaling of the longitudinal phase
velocity, C113L 2 5.0(7.0)K_3/2 CDL for a bee (fee) lattice, is different from that for one- and two-dimensional model,
whereas the transverse acoustic velocity, CBL 2 0. 1915”2 CDL, has the same scaling [331]. Note that in comparison
to monolayers, Eqs. (88) and (89), the magnitude of the phase velocity in three-dimensional crystal is larger for the
longitudinal mode, and is smaller for the transverse mode. For arbitrary K one can obtain the phase velocities of all
modes in the long-wavelength limit by using the results for the elastic constants of Yukawa crystals (e.g., [337]).

It is noteworthy that the wave modes in three-dimensional plasma crystals are similar to those in solids. There-
fore, the comprehensive investigation of particle dynamics in plasma crystals can give us an excellent opportunity
to study generic wave phenomena—mode interaction, umklapp processes, phonon scattering on defects, etc.—at the
kinetic level.

9.4.4. Instabilities in plasma crystals

There is a number of different mechanisms which can trigger wave instabilities and cause eventual melting of
plasma crystals. Some of these instabilities can operate irrespective of the phase state (although, the parameters of the
instabilities depend on the coupling parameter F), some are peculiar to plasma crystals, and some can set in only when
the crystal has a particular dimensionality (e.g., the instability can be triggered in monolayers only). The common type
is the ion streaming instability, which is similar to that discussed in Section 9.2.2. For strongly coupled and crystalline
states the instability threshold was calculated in Ref. [338]. It was found that the strong coupling generally leads to an
enhancement of the growth rates. The maj or wave instabilities peculiar to plasma crystals are

(i) Wake-induced instability in three-dimensional crystals: The charged grains suspended in if sheaths or dc striations
often assemble themselves into the so-called “vertically aligned” hexagonal lattices (see Section 10.3). Such structures
can only be stable at sufﬁciently high pressures. When the pressure (and, thus, the damping rate vdn) decreases below
a certain threshold the particles start oscillating horizontally, which indicates the instability onset [23 8]. The further
(relatively slight) pressure decrease leads to an increase of the oscillation amplitude and melting of the crystal [339,340].
This instability occurs because the presence of wakes makes the interparticle interaction nonreciprocal and, hence, the
total energy of the particle system is not conserved. The source of the energy is the ion ﬂux. The instability was ﬁrst
analysed theoretically by Schweigert [23 8] using the model of a point-like dipole characterized by the wake charge
Zwake located at distance Awake downstream from the grain. This model yields very good qualitative agreement with
experiments.

(ii) Coupling instability in monolayers: The wake potentials can play a crucial role also for the stability of the
monolayer plasma crystals. It was shown that the interaction of the charged grains with the wake potential of the
neighbouring grains causes a coupling between the in-plane and (vertical) out-of—plane DL wave modes. This coupling
can trigger the resonance instability of the DL waves when the two branches intersect [see, e.g., Eqs. (84) and (90)],
which occurs when the particle density in the monolayer exceeds a certain threshold [341]. Also, the neutral damping
rate should be low enough, otherwise the instability is inhibited. These two conditions have the following form:

n E 4€_K(K_l + 3152 + 3K_3)(QDL/QV)2 > 1 ,

Vdngv 7] _ 1IZwake/Zl(Awake/A)QV -
Comparison of the theoretical results with experiments and MD simulations reveals remarkably good agreement [239].
This mechanism might be the one of the main reasons for the monolayer melting at pressures below ~ 10 Pa.

(iii) Instability due to defects: Another instability mechanism which can be especially important in bilayer crystals is
associated with the so-called “strong defects”—the particles which are located above and below the “complete” layers
[342]. These particles were shown to be very effective sources of the local heating. The instability due to strong defects
starts somewhat before the wake-induced instability sets on, and makes the melting transition more smoothed as the
pressure decreases.

(iV) Instability due to charge ﬂuctuations: Stochastic variations of the grain charges can trigger another instability in
plasma crystals [136]. The mechanism of energy gain in this case is similar to stochastic heating considered in Section
8.2: the charge variations provide not only an additional LangeVin-like term in the equations of the particle motion, but
also result in a multiplicative effect, inducing a parametric instability. The instability can be triggered when the neutral
damping is below a threshold.

VdnSUZZQZDL/Qch ,

where 0'2Z is the dimensionless charge dispersion [see also the condition for the instability of a single particle, Eq. (61)].
If the variations of the grain charges are due to the discreteness of plasma (electron and ion) charges then the magnitude
of the dispersion is fairly small, 0'2Z ~ |Z |_1, and the instability is only possible at pressures far below ~1 Pa [136].
However, in suiﬁciently dense complex plasmas the charge ﬂuctuations might be due to the dust grain discreteness
[246], which yields substantially larger values of 022 and, hence, the instability can be possible at much larger pressures.
Nevertheless, one should note that so far there were no reliable experiments where this type of instability was clearly
identiﬁed.

9.5. Nonlinear waves

Complex plasmas, as any other plasmas are nonlinear media where the waves of ﬁnite amplitude cannot be generally
considered independently. Nonlinear phenomena in complex plasma are very diverse, due to a large number of different
wave modes which can be sustained. The wave amplitude can reach a nonlinear level because of different processes: this
is not necessarily an external forcing, or the wave instabilities—it can also be a regular collective process of nonlinear
wave steepening. In the absence of dissipation (or, when the dissipation is small enough), nonlinear steepening can be
balanced by wave dispersion which, in turn, can result in the formation of solitons. When the dissipation is large, it
can overcome the role of dispersion and then the balance of nonlinearity and dissipation can generate shock waves. In
many cases the lowest-order nonlinear terms are quadratic, and then the weakly nonlinear soliton dynamics is governed
by the Korteweg-de Vries (KdV) equation [343]. For solitons of arbitrary amplitude, the method of the SagdeeV
pseudopotential is very convenient [344]: in particular, this method allows us to determine the upper value of the Mach
number beyond which the dispersion is no longer sufﬁcient to balance the nonlinearity and, thus, the collisionless shock
is formed due to “collective” dissipation. The “conventional” dissipation is often determined by Viscosity, and then the
shock waves can be described by the KdV—Burgers equation [343,345]. However, in complex plasmas there is a rich
variety of mechanisms which determine nonlinear and dispersive properties of the medium. This generally makes the
description of nonlinear waves in complex plasmas more complicated.
9. 5.]. Ion solitons and Shocks

The theory predicts that in complex plasmas (as well as in electronegative plasmas) both compressive and rarefactive
dust ion—acoustic solitons are possible (e.g., [346,347]). It was shown that the properties of the DIA solitons (proﬁle
and the range of Mach numbers where the solitons can eXist) are strongly affected by the form of the electron and
ion distribution function, in particular—by the presence of “cold” and “hot” populations (e.g., in space environment)
and trapped electrons (e.g., in laboratory plasmas). The compressive DIA solitons were observed in experiments by
Nakamura [260] performed in a dusty plasma devise at very low pressures (19 ~ 10—2 Pa), whereas in plasmas with
negative ion component also the rarefactive solitons were reported [348,349]. At such pressures the collisions with
neutrals play almost no role, and a weak dissipation does not destroy the proﬁle of DIA solitons as long as the
dissipation time scales are longer than the duration of the soliton existence [291,350]. As regards the DIA shocks, they
were observed in different experiments [259,261,269] performed at pressures 19 ~ 10—2—1O_3 Pa. Depending on the
parameter regime (in particular—number density of grains), different dissipation mechanisms can play the maj or role
[291,351]: along with the ion Viscosity (due to collisions with grains), these are grain charge variations (ion absorbtion)
and Landau damping. The general trend is that in the absence of dust the shock front exhibits pronounced oscillatory
structure [261] typical for collisionless ion—acoustic shocks [352]. As the dust density increases the peaks become
smoothed and eventually disappear, leaving the monotonic front proﬁle, as shown in Fig. 29.
9.5.2. Dust solitons and Shocks

Longitudinal dust solitons of moderate amplitude were observed in experiments by SamsonOV et al. [263] and
Nosenko et al. [273]. Both experiments were performed in rf discharges at low pressures (p 2 1.8 — 2 Pa). The solitons
were excited in crystalline monolayers by electrical pulses or by the laser beams. Fig. 30 shows the evolution of the
soliton propagating along the crystal [263]. Theoretical study of the soliton dynamics is based on the analysis of Eq.
(83). Deﬁning X as the propagation vector and retaining the lowest-order nonlinearity and dispersion terms, the resulting
equation for the nonlinear wave dynamics is [263,35 3]

is the nonlinear coefﬁcient. Without the frictional dissipation, Eq. (91) is readily reduced to the KdV equation by
employing the stretched coordinates (x — C t, t). The soliton can only eXist when £2 and A have opposite signs, so that
the following relations can be fulﬁlled: — %AA = 482 /L2 = M 2 — 1, whereA and L are the soliton amplitude and width,

different densities n d of the dust particles of about 8.9 mm diameter. The DIA waves were excited with a positive ramp voltage applied to the source
anode, and the signals were detected by the movable Langmuir probe. The electron density perturbations were recovered from the perturbations of
the electron saturation current on the probe.

respectively, and M = V / C is the Mach number for the soliton velocity. The Mach number is a convenient control
parameter which deﬁnes the soliton proﬁle, —u = A cosh_2(£/L), with E = x — Vt.

In two-dimensional hexagonal lattices [353], £2 is always positive and has a very weak dependence on the direction of
propagation, A is always negative and can depend on the direction substantially, especially at K 2, 1. Such a combination
of signs implies that only compressive (A > O) supersonic (M > 1) solitons can propagate in crystalline monolayers,
as it is observed in experiments. In the nearest neighbour approximation, K2, 1, one can calculate parameters of
Eq. (91) by using the results for a one-dimensional string [263],

C2 = CgLKme) m1” ,

£2 = @213cm[G”<K>/K]”/[G<K>/K1” ,

A = K[G(K)/K]W/[G(K)/K]” , (92)
where G(K) = — 1n(eK — 1). This relatively simple theoretical model provides remarkably good agreement with the
experiments. If the neutral gas pressure is low enough the friction does not destroy the soliton [263]. The perturbation
simply slows down, approaching the asymptote V = C , and the form of the soliton changes in accordance with the
analytical solution (i.e., the amplitude decreases and the width increases, keeping the “soliton relation” AL2 2 const,
see Fig. 30). Thus, one can speak about a “weakly dissipative soliton” when the dissipation time scale, ~12; , exceeds
the time scale of the wave itself, ”91311;

The theory predicts in-plane transverse (shear) solitons in two-dimensional lattices [353], as well as the solitons due
to the coupling between longitudinal in-plane and vertical out-of—plane modes [3 54]. Such solitons, however, have not
yet been observed in experiments. There have been also a number of theoretical papers on properties of the DA solitons
in gaseous complex plasma [287,35 5—359], but no experiments have been done so far.

As regards the dust shock waves, this topic still needs to be explored, both theoretically and experimentally. The
theory of shocks in weakly coupled complex plasmas has been studied, e.g., in Refs. [360,361]. It was suggested that the
maj or dissipation mechanism providing the shock formation can be the dust charge variations, and the weak shocks can
be described by the KdV—Burgers equation. These results, however, have better applicability to the space environment,
where the complex plasmas can be found in the gaseous state and where the charge variation effects are nor inhibited
by the gas friction (see Section 9.2.2). For the strongly coupled plasmas, the generalized hydrodynamic approach
(see Section 9.3) was proposed [312,345]. This approach suggests that weak shocks cannot be described by the KdV—
Burgers equation in general case [312]. In experiments, “pure” shocks were only observed so far in two-dimensional
crystals [264,265]. (Term “pure” implies here that the momentum exchange in dust—dust collisions prevails over the
momentum loss due to neutral gas friction, vdd > vdn, so that charged grains have properties of one-phase ﬂuids, see
Section 6.3.) These shocks (generated by electrical pulses, like the solitons in experiments [263]) caused melting of
the crystal behind the front, as shown in Fig. 31. As the shock propagated and weakened it was seen that the melting
ceased. Further propagation of the pulse was in the form of a soliton, as described above. Other examples of strong
dust discontinuities were observed in microgravity experiments with a rf discharge [279] and in ground-based dc
experiments [280]. In both cases the shock—like structures were triggered in three-dimensional complex plasmas using
gas pulses. The experiments were performed at high gas pressures about 50—120 Pa, when the friction dissipation is very
strong, vdn ~ 100—300 s_l. Nevertheless, the “shocks” were observed during a few seconds almost undamped, which
suggests that there must be a mechanism of strong energy “inﬂux” into the structures (e.g., modulational instability).
Therefore, the dust discontinuities observed in Refs. [279,280] should rather be referred to as “dissipative structures”
where pure hydrodynamic effects presumably play minor role.

9.5.3. Mach cones

Dispersion relations of dust modes in complex plasmas suggest that, irrespective of the plasma state [see Eqs. (74),
(81), (82), (87)] the phase velocity attains the maximal value in the long-wavelength limit. For acoustic modes this
velocity—the “sound speed” C—is ﬁnite and therefore, similar to conventional media, the supersonic perturbations
(i.e., with Mach number M = V / C > 1) are always localized behind the object which produces these perturbations
(this can be a rapidly moving charged particle or a bunch of particles, biased probe, etc.). The perturbation front has
a conical form in a three-dimensional case and therefore it is called a “Mach cone”. In a two-dimensional case the
same name is adopted, although the front is a planar V—shaped perturbation. The opening angle ,u of the front at large

distances from the Object (where the nonlinearity should not play important role) is determined by the well-known
relation sinu = C/V E M‘l.

Originally, it was suggested that the Mach cones (wakes) can be excited in space dusty plasmas—e.g., in planetary
rings by big boulders [362,363] moving through the dust at a velocity that is somewhat higher than C. It was expected
that the discovery of Mach cones and the measurements of the opening angles during the Cassini mission to Saturn
will yield new information on the dusty plasma conditions in planetary rings. Unfortunately, no Mach cones detected
during this mission were reported. The Mach cones in laboratory complex plasmas were discovered by Samsonov et a1.
[254,255] in two—dimensional plasma crystals. They were generated by single particles spontaneously moving beneath
the monolayer along straight trajectories. (The physical mechanism which drives such motion is still an open issue;
for one of the possible explanations, see [364].) In experiments [271] the Mach cones were excited by the radiation
pressure of a focused laser beam. The wake reveals a multiple cone structure behind the front, as shown in Fig. 32.
Generally, the wake structure is determined by the dispersion and nonlinear properties Ofparticular wave modes excited
behind the front [353,365]. The formation of the second cone behind the ﬁrst one, with the opening angle smaller for
the second cone can be prescribed to the shear (transverse) wave front [365,366], because the (longitudinal) sound
speed is larger than the shear phase velocity [see Eqs. (88) and (89)]. Also, the shape of the cone wings can be affected
by the inhomogeneity of the particle density, as suggested in Ref. [367]. It was proposed to use the Mach cones as a
tool to determine the local parameters of complex plasmas [271,363], e.g., particle charge and the screening length,
making use of the measured sound speed.

10. Phase transitions in strongly coupled complex plasmas
10.]. Strong coupling ofdust Species

As we discussed in Section 6, the interactions between different species in complex plasmas are quite diverse and
depend on relations between the plasma characteristic parameters. One of the fundamental characteristics of a many-
particle interacting system is the coupling parameter F deﬁned as the ratio of the potential energy of interaction between
neighbouring particles to their kinetic energy. For the Coulomb interaction between charged particles,

and interact With each other Via the isotropic Debye—Hiickel (Yukawa) repulsive potential, With the screening determined
by the plasma electrons and ions. This model gives rather simpliﬁed picture of dusty plasma behaviour and is not

applicable to some experiments, especially when the plasma anisotropy plays an important role. Moreover, this model
does not take into account variations of particle charges, long-range interactions, the exact form of the conﬁning
potential, etc. However, the model was shown to be useful in providing qualitative results which are conﬁrmed by
experiments, and hence it may be considered as a reasonable basis to construct more sophisticated models in future.
10.2. Phase diagram OfDebye—Hiickel (Yukawa) systems

Besides complex plasmas, particles interacting with a Debye—Hﬁekel potential have been extensively studied in
different physical systems ranging from elementary particles to colloidal suspensions. Not surprisingly, their phase
diagrams have received considerable attention. Various numerical methods (usually, MC 0r MD simulations) have
been employed [337,368—373].

In our case, the static properties of the system are completely determined by two independent dimensionless param-
eters F and K = A //1. Fig. 33 shows the phase diagram of the Debye—Hiickel system in the (F , K)-p1ane, summarizing
available numerical results. Three phases were found, depending on the values of coupling and structure parameters.
For very strong coupling, F > F M, where F M denotes the value of F in the melting curve, there are solid fee and bee
phases and a liquid phase for F < F M. The bee phase is stable at small K, while fee is stable at larger K. The triple point
is at r 2 3.47 x 103 and K 2 6.90 [370].

Of particular interest for plasma crystallization experiments is the form of the melting (crystallization) curve F M =
F M(K) [10,337,369—371,374,375]. Results obtained for OCP systems (K = 0) indicate that the crystallization occurs
at F 2 106 [if the distance is measured in units of the Wigner—Seitz radius, (47md /3)_1/3, then F 2 172] [376—378].
Different analytical approximations for F M(K) were proposed (see, e.g., [180]). Vaulina and Khrapak [375] suggested
to employ the Lindernann criterion where the frequency of the dust—lattice waves is used as the characteristic frequency.
The melting line obtained is

FM€_K(1+K+%K2)2106, (93)
and yields remarkably good agreement with the results of numerical simulations at K S, 10 (see Fig. 33). One should
note, however, that the arguments used in deriving Eq. (93) are not really rigorous (for instance, there are no clear
physical arguments to justify the choice of the dust—lattice frequency instead of, e.g., the Einstein frequency).

From a practical point OfView, a simple criterion is often required, which allows us to judge whether the system under
consideration is in a crystalline or liquid state. Different phenomenological criteria for the crystallization (melting) of

"
"72","72 VE. Forlov el al. /Physz'cs Reports 42] (2005) 1—103

systems of interacting particles eXist, which are often independent of the exact form of interaction potential between
the particles. Some of them are convenient for dusty plasmas. Best known is the Lindemann criterion [379], according
to which melting of the crystalline structure occurs when the ratio of the root-mean-square particle displacement
to the mean interparticle distance reaches a value of 2 0.15. Another criterion is the value of the ﬁrst maximum
of the static structure factor in the liquid state [380], which reaches a value of 2 2.85 on the crystallization curve.
There also exists a simple crystallization criterion expressed in terms of the pair correlation function, the ratio of the
minimum to the maximum of which should be approximately equal to 2 0.2 on the crystallization curve. A simple
dynamic crystallization criterion, similar in some sense to the Lindemann criterion, was proposed by Lowen et al. [3 81].
According to this criterion, crystallization occurs when the diffusion constant reduces to a value of ~0.1 compared to
the diffusion constant for noninteracting particles. Later on, it was noted that this criterion holds for both 2D and 3D
systems [382].

10.3. Experimental investigation ofphase transitions in complex plasmas

As noted in the Introduction, dusty plasmas possess a number of unique properties which make these systems eX-
tremely attractive for investigation of different collective processes, including phase transitions. In particular, relatively
short temporal scales for relaxation and response to external perturbations, as well as simplicity in observation, allow
us not only to study static structure characteristics, but also to investigate the dynamics of phase transitions in detail
[1 87, 1 89,3 83,3 84]. Usually, phase transitions from crystalline to liquid-like or gas-like states are investigated in exper-
iments. Melting of a crystalline lattice can be initiated either by a decrease in the neutral gas pressure or by an increase
in the discharge power. This can be attributed to the fact that the plasma parameters change under these conditions
in such a way that the coupling parameter Fs decreases. This decrease is associated (at least in experiments with the
lowering of the neutral pressure) with a signiﬁcant increase in the kinetic energy of the dust particles. For example, the
initial temperature which was close to the neutral gas temperature (Td ~ Tn ~ 0.03 eV) in highly ordered crystal-like
structures increased with the lowering of pressure and structure melting up to ~5 eV [189] or even ~50 eV [384] at
minimal pressures examined in these works. This “anomalous heating” of the dust component in plasmas indicates
some source of energy which is effectively transferred into the kinetic energy of the dust particles. Several possible
mechanisms of anomalous heating were considered in the literature: Stochastic ﬂuctuation of the particle charge and
energy gain in an external electric ﬁeld [l32,l33,l35,l37,387] (see also Section 8.2), heating due to ion focusing
(wakes) [238,239,340] (see also Sections 8.4 and 9.4.4), spatial variations of the particle charge [233,473,236] (see
also Section 8.3), and the ion streaming instabilities [305,338] (see also Section 9.4.4).

Structural properties of strongly coupled dusty plasmas were investigated in [l l—l4,l9,l88,385,386]. Crystalline
structures such as bcc, fee, and hop, as well as their coexistence, were found for certain plasma and particle parameters.
Also, the vertically aligned hexagonal lattices—when particles form consecutive hexagonal layers in the horizontal
direction, but vertically they are aligned in strings—were observed. Such lattices can exist because the lower particles
are attracted by the wake potentials of the upper ones, so that this attraction overcomes the mutual particle repulsion
(see Section 5.2). The vertically aligned lattices are quite common for ground based experiments and are usually formed
by particles of a few microns in diameter. For smaller particles the wake effect presumably becomes too weak, so that
the particles form conventional close-packed crystals.

For the quantitative analysis of the ordered structures of particles observed in the experiment, it is common to use
the following three characteristics [3 85]: the pair correlation function, the bound-orientational correlation functions
(rotational invariants) and the structure factor. The pair correlation function g(r) measures the translational order in
the structure of interacting particles and represents the probability of ﬁnding two particles separated by a distance r
[for a gas of uncorrelated particles, g(r) 2 1]. For the case of an ideal crystal, g(r) is a series of delta functions (peaks)
whose positions and heights depend on crystal structure type. The bond-orientational correlation functions measure
orientational order in the structure. For two-dimensional systems, the bound-orientational order (correlation function)
$6 (r) is deﬁned in terms of the nearest-neighbour bond angles with respect to an arbitrary aXis. For a perfect hexagonal
structure $6 (r) E 1, while for other phases $6 (r) decays with distance. Finally, the static structure factor S (k) measures
order in the structure, similar to g(r). It is connected to the pair correlation function Via the Fourier transform (see,
e.g., [376]: S (k) = l —|— nd f dr[g (r) — l]e_ikr. These characteristics are applied for the analysis of static properties of
the highly ordered dust particle structure by [3 85]. In the same work, a comparison between the obtained quantitative
results and predictions of the KTHNY 2D melting theory is drawn.

of 6.9 urn diameter over the area 6.1 x 4.2 mmz) [387]. Horizontally, the particles are highly ordered and form a hexagonal lattice. Vertically, they
are settled strictly below each other, due to the ion wake effect (see text).
10.3.1. Melting

Let us discuss in more details the process of dusty plasma crystal melting induced by reducing pressure. Typical
image of a quasi 2D plasma crystal obtained in the sheath of a rf discharge is shown in Fig. 34 [3 87]. We illustrate
maj or features of the melting of such crystals with the results of a classical experiment by Thomas and Morﬁll [189].
The melting was initiated by the continuous lowering of pressure in krypton plasma, from p = 42 Pa, where the stable
ordered state of dust particles existed, to p = 22 Pa, for which the system lost any order and formed a gaseous state. The
pair correlation function, bond-orientational correlation function, and kinetic energy of the dust system were measured
while lowering the pressure.

From this analysis, the four “states” during the melting transition were identiﬁed. The ﬁrst, the “crystalline” state,
is characterized by the conservation of the crystalline lattice in the horizontal plane and chain formation in the vertical
direction as the pressure weakly reduced from the initial value. The particles in the lattice experience thermal oscillations
and highly occasional large-amplitude nonthermal oscillations—mostly in the Vicinity of lattice defects. The second,
the “ﬂow and ﬂoe” state, is characterized by the coexistence of islands of ordered crystalline structure (ﬂoes) and
systematic directed particle motion (ﬂows). In this state, the translational and orientational orders decrease signiﬁcantly
and occasional vertical particle migrations to other lattice planes are possible. Particle thermal motion still corresponds to
room temperature, de 2 0.2 mm/s, while directed ﬂow velocities are typically half of this. The third, the “Vibrational”
state, is characterized by some increase in orientational order and diminishing ﬂow regions. However, isotropic particle
Vibrations with increasing amplitudes appear. Kinetic energy and vertical migrations of particles increase and the
translational order continues to decrease. Finally, in the fourth, the “disordered” state, there is not any translational or
orientational order. The particles migrate freely both in the horizontal and vertical planes. The particle kinetic energies
are hundreds of times greater than the neutral temperature (Td 2 4.4 eV). Fig. 35 shows the quantitative results for
correlation functions g(r) and g6 (r) during melting.

Note that the transition of quasicrystalline structures to ﬂuid states is also observed in do discharges. This occurs
either by lowering the pressure or increasing the discharge current, as was obtained in Ref. [26].

We should note once again that, strictly speaking, theoretical concepts of 2D and 3D melting are not applicable to
describe these experiments, because the observed structures are essentially anisotropic—sometimes they are referred
to as “2 %-dimensional” crystals. This is not solely because of the wakes, but also due to the fact that the electric forces
exerted in the sheath turn out to be comparable with the interparticle forces. Therefore, the structures become very
compressed and inhomogeneous in the vertical direction. Hence, the experimental investigation of a monolayer crystal
melting, as well as experiments on phase transitions in 3D systems under microgravity conditions, might be much more
valuable.

With small (1.28 [Lin diameter) particles [388]. First, the particles were brought into a disordered liquid—like phase (by
a short pulse of increased discharge power). Afterwards, the system starts recrystallizing. Usually, this results in a
homogeneous nucleation, but sometimes this occurs in the form of a crystallization front. Fig. 36 shows evolution of
the crystallization front With the color—coded particle traces, Which gives an impression of the particle temperature. The
front is fairly narrow (about 3—4 interparticle distances) and has a well developed fractal structure. The temperature
drop across the front is a factor of 2 or 3. This indicates that the observed crystallization is strongly nonequilibrium.
One can also see the interface between different crystalline domains, Which has a narrow Width (2—3 lattice planes) and
a substantially higher temperature than the crystal domains themselves—direct evidence for interfacial melting. MD
simulations reveal all the qualitative features observed in the experiments.
A very important feature of the crystallization process is that the relaxation of the particle energy proceeds much
more slowly than in weakly coupled states (When the energy of each particle decays independently due to neutral gas

plane. In some regions intermediate stages are also observed.
friction) [21,388]. Transition from one metastable crystalline state to another, lower energy level can take minutes.
MD simulations show that the decay of kinetic energy occurs over much longer time than that estimated from neutral
gas drag. Presumably, this is because most of the energy is stored in the mutual electrostatic coupling, and each local
transition between neighbouring energy levels releases only a small fraction. In some cases, even When the system
reaches overall lattice equilibrium, it can remain noisy—caged particles oscillate With rather low frequencies. This can
be due to the possible existence of a few shallow metastable states of the same levels (separated by potential hills of
the order of the particle thermal energy). Then the Whole system can continuously jump from one state to another, yet
keeping the same type of lattice.

The nucleation and the subsequent growth processes in complex plasmas looks very similar to conventional crys—
tallization in overcooled media (e.g., in semiconductors, see Refs. [389,390]). Therefore, space— and time—resolved
investigation of elementary processes accompanying the nucleation and growth of plasma crystals can be very useful
for understanding some basic microscopic processes in liquid—solid phase transitions.

As regards the crystallization experiments performed under microgravity, we mention the results obtained onboard
the ISS With the PKE—Nefedov setup [21]. The vertically aligned lattices, usually observed in ground—based experiments
With plasma crystals suspended in the sheath, have not been observed in microgravity conditions. The particle chains
are believed to form due to the ion wakes downstream of the particle. In microgravity, however, particles occupy the
bulk region of the discharge Where (relatively weak) ambipolar ﬁelds cannot induce the wake formation. Therefore, in
microgravity experiments the interaction between particles is almost isotropic.

Instead of the vertically aligned structures, the coexistence of “conventional” crystalline domains—bcc, fee, and
hcp—was observed in microgravity, as shown in Fig. 37. The presence of the ﬁrst two lattice types might indicate

"
"76","76 VE. Forlov el al. /Physz'cs Reports 421 (2005) 1—103

that the system is close to the corresponding phase equilibrium curve in the phase diagram. A hop phase, however, is
a metastable state in Yukawa systems—it cannot eXist When the ﬁnal (ground) state is achieved. In the experiments,
small local ﬂuctuations of the particle density and temperature might result in the transition from the equilibrium foe
to a hop phase. These ﬂuctuations can be induced, for instance, by external excitation caused by the vortex motion.

Another possible reason for the hop domains to appear is the particle size dispersion. The size dispersion implies
a charge dispersion Which, in turn, leads to an enormous number of possible particle conﬁgurations (and thus lattice
energy levels) Within a given lattice type. And, of course, the existence of the hop domains may simply indicate that
the actual interaction potential is not of the Yukawa form.

The results obtained so far in experiments on the liquid—solid phase transitions in complex plasmas look quite
promising. In the future, major efforts should be put into the detailed investigations of kinetics of the ﬁrst order
phase transitions, observing melting and crystallization (annealing) of complex plasmas as well as transitions between
different lattices domains. Similar to the investigation of hydrodynamic instabilities discussed in the next section, the
maj or objective here is to identify the mechanisms responsible for the onset of the transitions on a “quasiniolecular”
level. Careful experiments along With molecular dynamics simulations can help us to understand the microscopic picture
and the hierarchy of the processes that govern the transitions. This Will also allow us to specify the phase diagram in the
Vicinity of the liquid—solid phase transition. The microscopic processes of particular interest should be the relaxation
of the particle energy and onset of nucleation in the beginning of the crystallization, criteria for the homogeneous
nucleation or the crystallization in the form of a front, particle accommodation at the interfaces between different
phases, threshold for nonequilibrium amorphous solidiﬁcation (quenching), and metastable transitions in solids.

11. Fluid behaviour of complex plasmas
11.1. T rampart properties

The most fundamental quantities characterizing the dynamic behaviour of the dust subsystem are the diffusion
coefﬁcient Dd and the Viscosity COGﬂ‘lClGHtS, in particular—the shear Viscosity 17d. They can be determined using the
Green—Kubo formulas [391]. For instance, the diffusion coefﬁcient is Dd = % fooo Hv (t) dt, Where Hv (t) = (V(t)v(0))
is the velocity autocorrelation function, and the shear Viscosity is 11d 2 Ta?1 fooo H00) dt, Where H50) 2 (a(t)a(0))
is the autocorrelation function for the microscopic shear stress. The transport coefﬁcients can be directly deduced
from MD simulations (e.g., by using the Green—Kubo formulas). Diffusion in Debye—Hﬁckel systems has been studied
numerically in Refs. [337,372—374,381,392—394]. The Viscosity coelﬁcients have been detennined numerically in
Refs. [321—323]. It is important to realize that complex plasmas can be in a broad range of “dynamical states”—froni
one-phase ﬂuids to particle tracers, as discussed in Section 6.3 (see Fig. 20). Therefore, the transport properties of the
dust subsystem are determined not only by the mutual grain interaction, but also by neutral gas friction.

The standard diffusion theory is based on the assumption that fooo Hv (t) dt < 00. This excludes an important class
of processes called “fractional Gaussian noises”, Which leads to particle trajectories that are classiﬁed as “fractional
Brownian motion” [395]. For these processes the mean square displacement scales as o< IZH, Where H is called the
“Hausdorff exponent” [396]. For H = 1/2 we have standard diffusion, for H < 1/2 the resulting motion is subdiffusive,
and for H > 1/2 the motion is superdiffusive [395]. Standard diffusion theory also fails if the velocity probability
distribution function is non-Gaussian but has algebraic tails, so that the variance (V(l)2) diverges [3 97—3 99]. Even for
a Markovian velocity process the resulting motion can be superdiﬂcisive due to the presence of very large velocities
(Levy ﬂights).

A classical discussion of all the aspects of anomalous diffusion mentioned above, With numerous physical examples,
can be found in Ref. [400]. Anomalous diffusion can be described in the framework of fractional kinetics [401,402]. The
solutions of fractional diffusion equations, like solutions of standard diffusion equations, yield the probability density
of ﬁnding a particle at a given position, at a given time. This can be linked to the experiments as particle tracking
data allow not only to determine the shape of the (non-Gaussian) distribution but also to follow its evolution in time
(“coarse graining” technique [403]).

Statistical properties of particle transport in strongly coupled quasi-ZD dusty plasma systems were addressed in Refs.
[403—407]. These systems are 2D in the sense that they consist of several layers, but the motion is restricted to the
horizontal dimensions. Superdiffusion was observed on short time scales up to 10—20 s due to collective (vortex) motion

"
"77","VE. Forlov el al. /Physz'cs Reports 42] (2005) I —103 77
[404] or due to cooperative fast particle cluster excitations [406], but normal diffusion was observed on longer time-
scales. It was shown that the excitations of fast particles results in non-Gaussian velocity distribution and cooperatively
excited cites appear in form of clusters with power-law size distributions [406]. In Refs. [404,406] the transition
from superdiffusion to normal diffusion was observed to occur at time scales when the standard deViation of the
particle displacement approaches the mean interparticle distance. Ratynskaya et al. [403] reported superdiffusive
particle transport on time scales for which particles diffuse several interparticle distances and the self—similar nature
of the particle dynamics was conﬁrmed by a combination of different statistical analyses. In this work the position
distribution was shown to be non-Gaussian with exponential tails. The development and propagation of lattice defects
constitute essential elements in the particle transport. In Ref. [407] structural defects in the hexagonal lattice were
identiﬁed and tracked in space and time.

So far, there have been only two experiments reported recently on the ﬁrst attempts to measure the shear Viscosity
in liquid complex plasmas [324,408]. The particles were pushed by a laser beam and the magnitude of the Viscosity
coefﬁcient was then deduced from the resulting proﬁle of the velocities (e.g., by applying the NaVier—Stokes equation
with the gas friction term [324]). The experiments were performed under quite different conditions and yielded very
different values of the kinematic Viscosity, 17d / mdnd ~ 10—2 cniZ/s in Ref. [324] (which is compatible with the
kinematic Viscosity of water) and ~1 cm2 /s in Ref. [408]. Also, the authors of Ref. [3 24] argued that both the magnitude
and a qualitative behaViour of the measured Viscosity are in agreement with the results of numerical simulations
[321—323]. One should bear in mind, however, that strongly coupled complex plasmas are apparently non-Newtonian
liquids and, hence more sophisticated analysis will be required in future experiments.

It is worth noting that one should be very careful in using the numerically calculated transport COCﬂ‘IClCntS, in
particular—in attempts to apply these results directly for the analysis of experiments: there are a number of unresolved
issues, e.g., plasma anisotropy, long-range interactions including shadowing effects, the effect of external forces and/or
boundary conditions, particle charge variations, etc. which still have to be addressed.

11.2. Hydrodynamic instabilities

An interesting question is, of course: How relevant are liquid plasmas for the study of conventional liquids? The
implication is clear—if they are relevant, this opens up a completely new approach to nanoﬂuidics, the kinetic approach,
which will then have the major impact on the ﬁeld. In fact, one of the interesting aspects of complex plasmas (which
was discussed in details in Section 6.3) is that although they are intrinsically multiphase systems, the rate of momentum
exchange through binary (electrostatic) collisions between the microparticles can exceed that due to interactions with the
neutral gas signiﬁcantly—thus providing an essentially one-phase system (e.g., ﬂuids) for kinetic studies. Moreover,
comparison in terms of similarity parameters (Reynolds and Mach numbers) suggests that liquid complex plasmas
are remarkably like conventional liquids, e.g., water—observed at the molecular level [191,324,409]. This suggests
that liquid plasmas can indeed serve as a powerful new tool for investigating ﬂuid ﬂows on (effectively) nanoscales,
including the all-important transition from collective ﬂuid behaViour to indiVidual kinetic behaViour (see Section 12.2),
as well as nonlinear processes on scales that have not been accessible for studies so far. Of particular interest could
be kinetic investigations of instabilities in ﬂuids and the transition to turbulence (e.g., Ref. [410]). IndiVidual particle
observations can provide crucial new insights—e.g., whether the basic hydrodynamical instabilities (Kelvin—Helniholtz,
Rayleigh—Taylor, Tollmien—Schlichting, etc.) will survive on interparticle distance scales, and whether the transition
to turbulence can be seen at the particle (kinetic) level.

To illustrate ﬂuid properties of complex plasmas let us consider examples of highly resolved shear ﬂows generated
in a rf discharge chamber [191] and shown in Fig. 38. In different regions of the microparticle cloud different ﬂow
topologies are observed, with the (average) ﬂow lines being either straight (a) or curved (b). The lower part of the
system is in the crystalline state at rest. The observations suggest that the width and the structure of the transition
(mixing) layer strongly depends on the geometry. For the planar ﬂow the crystalline interface is remarkably smooth,
with the ﬂow along a particular (crystalline) monolayer. The trajectories of indiVidual ﬂowing particles experience
only weak deﬂections and the overall ﬂow appears to be stable and laminar. In contrast, the curved ﬂow interface has
a curious “rough” structure, the ﬂow is unstable and not laminar, a “mixing layer” is formed between the ﬂowing
regime and the crystalline region—this is where momentum transfer takes place. It is also apparent that the mixing
layer becomes unstable at the indiVidual particle level. The microscopic driving mechanism for the instability seen in
Fig. 38(b) is identiﬁed as the centrifugally driven Rayleigh—Taylor instability. Analysing a whole sequence of such

parameters relevant to the experiment.

images, one can quantify this perturbation in two ways—the fraction of interpenetrating particles, and the fraction of
particles undergoing large angle collisions in the surface layer. For the straight ﬂow, the quantities are (almost) 0%,
and approximately 5%, for the curved ﬂow approximately 5% and 30%. This can be understood kinetically in terms
of the higher collision frequency with smaller impact parameter due to particle inertia at a curved surface. This has
also been conﬁrmed by numerical simulations as shown in Fig. 39 (particle velocities are grey—scaled, increasing from
black to white). The simulations were conducted for similar geometry and ﬂow conditions as in the experiments. The
topology of the mixing layer found in the simulations corresponds closely to the measurements, which supports our
kinetic interpretation.

Another example of the hydrodynamic behaviour of liquid complex plasrnas [409] is shown in Fig. 40. Particles were
ﬂowing around an “obstacle”—the void of size ~100 A (equivalent to ~100 “molecular” sizes). One can see stable
laminar shear ﬂow around the obstacle, the development of a “wake” exhibiting stable vortex ﬂows, and a mixing layer
between the ﬂow and the wake. The mixing layer is observed to be quite unstable at the kinetic level, with instabilities
becoming rapidly nonlinear. The width of the mixing layer grows monotonically with distance from the border where the
laminar ﬂow becomes detached from the obstacle. The growth length scale is of the order of a few A , i.e., much smaller
than the hydrodynamic scales nd (dnd /dx)_1 or Ltd(dud /dx)_1, which would be expected macroscopically in ﬂuids
and refer to the Rayleigh—Taylor or Kelvin—Hehnholtz instability, respectively. This rapid onset of surface instabilities
followed by mixing and momentum exchange at scales ~41, i.e., the smallest interaction length scale (effective particle
size) available, is not consistent, therefore, with conventional macroscopic ﬂuid instability theories. While this could
not rightfully be expected at the kinetic level, it clearly points to new physics and, possibly, a hierarchy of processes
that is necessary to describe interacting ﬂuid ﬂows: ﬁrst, binary collision processes provide particle and momentum
exchange on kinetic scales (a few A), then collective effects (due to the correlations deﬁning ﬂuid ﬂows) take over and
“propel” this “seed” instability to macroscopic scales.

Fig. 40. (a) Topology of the particle ﬂow around the void [409]. Experiments were performed in argon rf discharge with particles of diameter 3.7 um
at neutral gas pressure 64 Pa. The ﬂow leads to a compressed laminar layer, which becomes detached at the outer perimeter of the wake. The steady
vortex ﬂow patterns in the wake are illustrated. The boundary between laminar ﬂow and wake becomes unstable, a mixing layer is formed which
grows in width with distance downstream. The system is approximately symmetric around the vertical axis, the vortices are tori and the wake has
the shape of a ﬂaring funnel (exposure time 1 s). (b) An example of the mixing layer—an enlargement of the left side of the ﬂow regime shown in
(a) (exposure time 0.05 s). The points (lines) represent traces of slow (fast) moving microparticles.

It is noteworthy that even for the planar ﬂow the interface can be unstable, due to Kelvin—Helmholtz instability [191].
This has been observed in the simulations, but for a rather narrow shear velocity range. This can be understood as follows:
ﬁrst, the Reynolds number should exceed a certain threshold to trigger the instability (since the Viscosity is ﬁnite) and
hence there exists a lower velocity limit. Second, the collisional cross section cfparticles falls off rapidly with velocity
(cc 1454) which leads to a corresponding decrease in the momentum transfer efﬁciency. Hence a Kelvin—Helmholtz—
type instability must be conﬁned to a narrow ﬂow velocity range. Whilst this principal argument appears to be well
understood, there are some essential elements still unclear, Viz. the kinetic trigger of the instability and the velocity
range, quantitatively, where the ﬂow energy can get converted to unstable particle motion.

12. Onset of cooperative phenomena in complex plasmas

Complex plasmas allow us to investigate mesoscopic systems at the “molecular level”, by observing the evolution of
the dynamical and structural properties as the number of charged grains in the system gradually increases. A promising
direction of study is the physics of crystalline and liquid systems in the limit where the correlation scales are comparable
to or even larger than the system scales. Below we outline the progress achieved so far on these topics.

12.]. Coulomb clusters

Coulomb clusters are the ordered systems which consist of a ﬁnite number ofmicroparticles interacting Via a repulsive
potential and conﬁned by external forces (e. g., of electrostatic nature). In many cases, the interaction potential is believed
to be of the Debye—Hiickel (Yukawa) form, and therefore such systems are also called “Yukawa clusters”. The difference
between the dust clusters and the dust crystals is rather conditional: both systems in fact consist of a ﬁnite number of
particles. The term “clusters” is usually reserved for systems with the number of particles N 3 102—103, while larger
formations are refereed to as “crystals”. A more precise deﬁnition of clusters would be the ratio of the number of
particles in the outer shell to the total number of particles in the system. For crystals, this ratio should be small. Similar
systems can be formed, for instance, in nonneutral plasmas in Penning or Paul traps [411,412], where the vacuum
chamber is ﬁlled with the ions, as well as in colloidal solutions with macroscopic charged particles [413]. Examples

of two—dimensional Coulomb clusters are electrons 0n the surface of liquid He [414] and electrons in quantum dots

of conﬁning potential.

Historically, clusters consisting of repulsive particles in an external conﬁning potential were ﬁrst investigated with
the use of numerical modelling (mostly by MC and MD methods). Taking into account the possibility of applying
the simulation results to dust clusters, we mention here Refs. [416—425]. Most simulations were performed for two-
dimensional clusters in an external harmonic (parabolic) potential. Such a conﬁguration is usually realized in ground-
based experiments with dusty plasma in gas discharges. The simulations show that for a relatively small number of
particles in the cluster the “shell structure” is formed with the number of particles N j in the jth shell (Zj N j = N ).

At zero temperature, the unique equilibrium conﬁguration (N 1, N2, N3, . . .) exists for a given particle number N.
Such conﬁgurations are analogous to the MendeleeV’s Periodic Table, the structure of which depends on the shape of
the interaction potential, conﬁning potential, and their relative strengths. At ﬁnite temperatures, metastable states with
energies close to the ground state can also be realized.

The ﬁrst experimental investigation of dust clusters was reported in Ref. [426]. The experiment was performed in
the sheath of an rf discharge. A hollow coaxial cylinder of 3 cm in diameter and 1.5 cm in height was put on the bottom
electrode to conﬁne the dust particles. Clusters with a number of particles from a few up to 791 were investigated.
Fig. 41 shows images of typical clusters with different numbers of particles, and Fig. 42 demonstrates a series of the
observed conﬁgurations. For large N, the inner particles arrange themselves into a quasiuniform hexagonal structure,
whereas near the outer boundary particles form several circular shells. The mean interparticle separation increases up
to about 10% from the centre to boundary.

In Refs. [202,427,428], the rotation of dust clusters around the symmetry aXis was studied. In the ﬁrst work, the
cluster rotation was caused by the laser pressure. Both the rigid body and the differential (intershell) rotation had been
observed. In two other works, the cluster rotation was initiated by the presence of the magnetic ﬁeld parallel to the
cluster axis of symmetry (see Section 13). The rotational frequency was found to be linear with the weak magnetic
ﬁeld, although it saturates at moderate magnetic ﬁeld strength [428], and it is inversely proportional to the ﬁeld in the
strong ﬁeld limit [202].

For two—dimensional clusters consisting of N particles and conﬁned radially in a harmonic potential trap (characterized
by the conﬁnement frequency am), there eXist 2N normal modes, (05 with 1 < Z < 2N. The normal modes are the
eigenvalues of the cluster dynamical matrix, and the corresponding eigenvectors deﬁne the mode oscillation patterns
[418]. For pure Coulomb interaction (lattice parameter K is equal to zero) there are three normal modes that are
independent of the particle number N: (i) the rotation of the entire cluster around the centre of the conﬁnement at
a) = 0, (ii) the (twofold degenerate) sloshing oscillation of the centre of mass of the cluster in the horizontal potential
well at a) = coo, and (iii) a coherent radial oscillation of all particles, the so called breathing mode, at a) = x/gwo. For
screened interaction (K > 0), the frequency of the ﬁrst two modes is unaffected since they do not involve a relative
particle motion. In contrast, the frequency of the breathing mode and all other modes becomes dependent on K and on
the particle number N.

The oscillations of particles in Coulomb clusters were investigated in [418,429—432]. To illustrate the experiments,
we discuss the recent work ofMelzer [431], where the normal modes of 2D Coulomb clusters of N = 1 — 145 particles
trapped in the sheath above the lower rf electrode were studied. The normal modes were obtained from the thermal
Brownian motion of the particles around their equilibrium positions in the cluster. This method extends the thermal
excitation technique by Nunomura et al. [256] (developed for extended 2D lattices) t0 the case of Coulomb clusters.

In Fig. 43a the particle trajectories in N = 3 cluster are shown. One can see that the thermal ﬂuctuations of the
microspheres around their equilibrium positions are small, but they are nevertheless sufﬁcient to determine the mode
spectrum. The siX eigenmodes of this cluster calculated for the Yukawa potential are depicted in Fig. 43b. There are the
following modes: the breathing mode (Z = 1), rotation of the entire cluster (Z = 2), a twofold degenerate “kink” mode
(E = 3, 4), and the two sloshing modes (Z = 5, 6). The mode frequencies 60% (in units of %w%) are also indicated for
K = 0. For K > 0 the oscillation pattern of the eigenmodes is unchanged. Their frequencies, however, decisively depend

on K (see Fig. 44). Obviously, the cluster rotation and the sloshing mode are independent of K. The frequencies of the
kink mode and the breathing rnode increase with K.

The lowest-frequeney rnode (LFM) had been identiﬁed for different cluster sizes. For small particle numbers the
intershell rotation was shown to be the LFM, whereas for larger clusters the formation of vorteX—antivortex pairs were
observed. This behaviour is generally within the theoretical expectations for pure Coulomb systems [418]. Analysis
of the highest-frequency modes (HFM) had shown that for small clusters, the breathing mode with a coherent radial
motion of all particles is the HFM. For larger clusters, modes with a relative three-particle oscillation localized in the
centre of the cloud provide the highest frequencies. The rnode-integrated spectrum shows two broad rnaxirna which are
explained from “shear—like” 0r “cornpression—like” modes. The transition from ﬁnite number to crystal-like properties
was observed to occur around N = 12 particles.

Also, we brieﬂy mention results ofrecent experiments [335,386] where the three-dimensional clusters were observed.
In Ref. [335], the experiments were performed in the adaptive rf electrode chamber (the rf electrode is an assembly of
small pixels, each having an independent control of the rf voltage [433]) ﬁlled with argon at pressure 40—80 Pa, with
plastic particles of 6.8 nm diameter. By a ﬁne adjustment of the rf applied to a dc-grounded pixel it was possible to
control the number of particles in the cluster and also its shape. The number of particles varied from 4 up to about 200.
In the equilibrium positions the vertical conﬁnement is provided by the electric ﬁeld of the double layers/striations

combined with suitable conditions for the charging. It is unclear if the horizontal conﬁnement is due to plasma pressure
or by internal forces among the cluster components, or by ion drag. More work is certainly needed in order to explain the
formation of such structures. In another experiment [386], the sc-called “Coulomb balls”—spherical particle clouds, in
which hundreds or thousands of identical plastic spheres of 3 .4 nm diameter are arranged in clearly separated crystalline
shells—were observed to form in a rf discharge at pressures 5 0—1 5 0 Pa. The particles were leVitated by thermophcretic
forces, which is accomplished by heating the lower plate, and the radial conﬁnement was provided by a short upright
glass tube. The highest order was observed at the outer shells, whereas in the centre the particles were in a liquid
(amorphous) state with no signiﬁcant orientational order.

12.2. Nanoﬂuidics

The behaviour of ultrathin liquid conﬁned in a mescsccpic gap is a fundamental problem in nancscience and
technology. As the gap width goes down to the molecular scale, structure and transport properties deViate from the
bulk liquid, under the effects of discreteness, ﬁnite boundary, and thermal ﬂuctuation. For instance, the formation of a
layered structure next to the boundary and the sluggish ﬂow with large ﬂuctuation and nonlinear mean velocity response
to the external stress have been observed [434—43 8].

In Ref. [439], the microscopic observation of the conﬁnement-induced layering 0f quasi-ZD complex plasma liquids
is reported. The experiments were conducted in a rf discharge at 2 30 Pa. Two parallel vertical plates were put on the
centre region of the bottom electrode surface to laterally conﬁne polystyrene particles of 7 nm diameter and, hence,
to form mescsccpic channels down to a few interparticle spacings in the width. Microscopically, the particle mutual
interaction tends to generate ordered triangular lattice-type domains with small amplitude position oscillations, which
can be reorganized through stick—slip string- or vorteX-type hopping induced by stochastic thermal kicks [406]. However,
the boundaries suppress the nearby transverse hopping. Fig. 45 shows the snapshots of particle conﬁgurations and the
corresponding transverse density distribution for different “number of layers”, N. Basically, at larger N, the density
proﬁles with decaying oscillation from both boundaries manifest the conﬁnement-induced (two to three) outer layers
near each boundary, which sandwich the more disordered isotropic liquid with a ﬂat density proﬁle in the centre region.
The transition to the layered structure up to the centre at N < 7 is eVidenced by the appearance of sharp peaks of the
density proﬁle. Run G shows the ordered crystal-like structure with four layers.

It is known, that in contrast to the mean velocity proﬁle with a uniform shear rate for a bulk Newtonian ﬂow between
two oppositely moving parallel plates, in sheared glassy materials such as foams, micelles, dense colloids, and dense
granular systems shear banding is observed. The sheared ﬂow tends to separate into bands with different shear rates
through local stress relaxation [440—443]. It causes the formation of the outer shear bands in which the mean shear
rate, the velocity ﬂuctuations, and the structural rearrangement rate are all enhanced, and leaves a weakly perturbed
centre band.

The microscopic dynamics of the shear ﬂow in a 2D mescsccpic complex plasma liquids has been studied at the
kinetic level [444] (with the experimental setup used for studying the conﬁnement-induced layering in Ref. [439]).
Due to the formation of the nearby layered structure shown in Fig. 45, the persistent and directional slow drive from
the external stress along the boundary enhances stick—slip type structural rearrangements which cascade into the liquid
through many-bcdy interaction. It was found that the ﬂow consists of two outer shear bands about three interparticle
distance in width nearby boundaries and a centre low-rate zone. The former has higher levels of both longitudinal and
transverse velocity ﬂuctuations. The shear banding phenomenon originates from the local stress release through the
local rearrangement events adj acent t0 the boundary.

13. Magnetized complex plasmas

In this section we discuss the inﬂuence of external magnetic ﬁelds on a complex plasma. In selecting the material,
the priority has been given to the experimentally observed phenomena. For instance, we do not discuss here extensive
literature existing 0n dust waves in the presence of magnetic ﬁelds (this topic has been well addressed in other reViews
and monographs, see, e.g., [445]).

The inﬂuence of external magnetic ﬁelds on complex plasmas has been studied in different types of laboratory
discharge plasmas. In the very ﬁrst experiments by Satc et al. [446,447], where the vertical magnetic ﬁeld of about

4 X 10—2 T was applied to an argon discharge at 2 10 Pa, the cloud of electrostatically conﬁned 2 10 um grains rotated
in the azimuthal direction (horizontally). It was clear immediately that this rotation has no relation to the magnetization
of the particles themselves—neither the radius of rotation nor the frequency were comparable to the gyroradius and
the cyclotron frequency of particles. Also, the neutral friction rate was much higher than the Observed frequency of the
rotation, so that the particle gyromotion was suppressed. Later on, similar experiments were performed by Konopka
et al. [200] at 2 10—2 T in a if discharge with a monolayer of 8.9 gm particles, as shown in Fig. 46. The observed
horizontal rotation of the particle cloud was attributed to the azimuthal component of the ion drag force. This component
appears because of the azimuthal drift of the ions (ﬂowing down to the rf electrode) in crossed vertical magnetic and
radial electric ﬁelds (the latter arises because of weak radial conﬁnement). The angular velocity of the cloud rotation
is determined by the balance of the azimuthal ion drag and the neutral friction forces. Fig. 47 shows typical images of
the rotating particle clouds observed in experiments [200].

In terms of magnetization of complex plasma species, one can naturally introduce three ranges for magnetic ﬁeld
B—“weak”, “medium”, and “strong” ﬁelds. For the weak ﬁelds the ions are not magnetized—the ion cyclotron fre-
quency, Qci =6 B / m ,- , is smaller than the ion collision rate with neutrals, Vin. Ions become magnetized in the medium ﬁeld
range, and charged grains—in the strong ﬁeld range (the latter means that the dust cyclotron frequency ch = e | Z | B / m d
exceeds the neutral damping rate vdn). Obviously, the “transitional” magnitudes of B are proportional to the neutral
gas pressure: for p ~ 10 Pa, the ions typically become magnetized at B ~ 0.3—1 T, and the micronsize particles—at
10—30 T. While the meaning of the strong ﬁelds is clear—this is the range where the gyromotion of charged particles
can be directly observed, the division into weak and medium ﬁelds is introduced because of the fact that the azimuthal

ion velocity scales as oc 90,- “931' —|— vi”) [201]. Since the motion of unmagnetized particles is mostly driven by the
ion drag force, the rotation of the particle cloud should obey the same scaling. The angular velocity of the rotation
should increase as a) QC B in the weak ﬁeld range, attain a maximum at Qci 2 Vin, and then decrease as a) QC 3—1 in
the medium ﬁeld range. Such behaviour had been observed in experiments [448] and then was explained theoretically
in Ref. [201].

The azimuthal ion drag, F g, is proportional to the electric ﬁeld of the radial conﬁnement, Er. Depending on the
proﬁle of E r (r), the particle cloud can rotate as a rigid body or exhibit a differential rotation, so that the angular velocity
u) varies With the distance to the rotation centre, r, and can even change the sign [200]. This gives us an opportunity
to study shear ﬂows in strongly coupled complex plasma and observe the shear—induced melting. Note that the friction
force scales as Fnd oc cor and, hence, the rigid body rotation Will always be observed When Er oc r. However, the very
fact of the rigid body rotation does not necessarily implies the linear increase of E r , but can be just because the coupling

between particles in the cloud is strong enough [200,201]. In this case, the angular velocity of the cloud rotation is
determined by the torque balance, [Fiﬁ (r) —|— Fnd (r)]r2 dr 2 0.

Recently, experiments with a new type of complex plasmas containing paramagnetic particles have been started
[449,450]. Particles with diameter 2a 2 4.5 nm and the magnetic permittivity ,u 2 4 were suspended in a argon rf
discharge at pressure 46 Pa in inhomogeneous magnetic ﬁeld. In the region where the particles levitated, the (tunable)
magnetic ﬁeld was up to B ~ 0.1T with the gradient |VB| 2 5 T/m pointed up. The magnetic ﬁeld induced a
magnetic moment at each particle, m 3 oc a3 B, so that the particles were pulled upward in the direction of the magnetic
ﬁeld gradient. These experiments made possible to study interaction of magnetic particles with each other and with a
magnetic ﬁeld.

From the observed increase of the leVitation height with the increase of the magnetic ﬁeld, the particle charge and
the thickness of the plasma sheath were estimated [449]. It was demonstrated that the force due to magnetic gradient,
o< m B |VB|, can compensate gravity. Therefore, the magnetic ﬁelds can serve as a diagnostic tool for the complex
plasma parameters. Also, the possibility of magnetically induced formation of a plasma crystal was discussed. Various
mutual dust—dust interactions, including the forces due to induced magnetic and electric moments of the grains were
theoretically considered [450]. It turned out that the electromagnetic forces from particle magnetization and polarization
may result in mutual repulsion as well as attraction. It was found that magnetized grains can coalesce, forming ﬁeld-
aligned chains. Analysis of the particle interaction forces showed that at intermediate magnetic ﬁelds (used in the
experiment) the particles can agglomerate only if their kinetic energy is high enough to overcome the barrier in the
electrostatic interaction potential.

The experimental results published so far on the magnetized complex plasmas clearly show that these investigations
can lead to new effects in the study of dusty plasmas. The weak magnetic ﬁelds allow us to introduce a new degree of
freedom into the system, which makes possible to control, e.g., the interparticle interaction, ﬁeld of forces, etc. without
considerable distortion of the discharge parameters. On the other hand, the properties of the discharge plasma itself are
poorly known at the medium and, moreover, strong ﬁelds. Also, the grain charges may be signiﬁcantly affected by the
magnetic ﬁeld. Therefore, comprehensive experimental investigations for such conditions should probably be one of
the maj or directions for the future.

14. Complex plasmas with nonspherical particles

Recently, the ﬁrst investigations (both experimental and theoretical) of complex plasmas with asymmetric particles
have been started [190,445,451—457]. In Ref. [451] the geometrical aspect ratio was ac ~ 3, and the ﬁrst experiments
with strongly asymmetric particles (at = 40—80) were carried out in Ref. [452]. It is well known that colloidal solutions,
which have much in common with dusty plasmas, show a much broader spectrum of possible states in the case of
strongly asymmetric cylindrical or disk particles. In such solutions, liquid phase and several liquid-crystal and crystal
phases with different degrees of orientational and positional ordering can be observed. It is also well known that
the use of cylindrical probes (in addition to spherical) considerably broadens the possibilities of low-temperature
plasma diagnostics. In Ref. [452], where the experimental setup analogous to that shown in Fig. 4 was employed,
nylon particles (Q = 1.1 gcm‘3) of length 300 um and diameters 7.5 and 15 nm, as well as particles of lengths 300
and 600 um and diameter 10 nm, were introduced into the plasma of a dc discharge. The discharge was initiated in
neon or a neon/hydrogen mixture at a pressure of 10—250Pa. The discharge current was varied from 0.1 to 10mA.
In this parameter range, standing striations were formed in the discharge, which made possible particle leVitation.
A neon/hydrogen mixture was used to levitate heavier particles of larger diameter (15 am) or larger length (600 um).
In this case, the particles formed structures consisting of 3—4 horizontal layers. Lighter particles levitated in pure neon
and formed much more extended structures in the vertical direction.

The observed structures formed by microcylinders revealed clear ordering. All particles lay in the horizontal plane
and were oriented in a certain direction. One could expect that the orientation should be determined by cylindrical
symmetry of the discharge tube. However, no correlation between the particle orientation and the tube symmetry was
found. Nor could the preferential orientation of the particles be explained by the interparticle interaction, because
individual particles were oriented in the same direction. Presumably, the preferential orientation was related to a weak
asymmetry in the discharge. This was conﬁrmed by the fact that the orientation could be changed by introducing an
artiﬁcial perturbation into the discharge. In later experiments [454], nylon particles of lengths 300 and 600 um and

diameter 10 um coated by a thin layer of conducting polymer were utilized. In a dc discharge they formed structures
identical to those formed by uncoated particles of the same size.

Levitation of cylindrical particles was also observed near the sheath edge of a capacitively coupled rf discharge
[453]. In this experiment, the cylindrical particles of length 300 um and diameters 7.5 and 15 nm were used, and a
small fraction of very long particles (up to 800 am) of 7.5 nm in diameter was also present. A typical picture of a
structure formed by these particles is shown in Fig. 48. Longer particles are oriented horizontally and mainly located
in the central part limited by a ring placed on the electrode, while shorter particles are oriented vertically along the
electric ﬁeld. Levitation and ordering of the cylindrical particles occurred only for pressures higher than 5 Pa and a
discharge power above 20 W. An increase in the discharge power did not signiﬁcantly affect particle levitation. The
average distance between vertically oriented particles varied from 1 to 0.3 mm. An increase in particle density leads to
degradation of the quasicrystalline structure and increase of particle kinetic energies. The further increase in density is
impossible because the particles start falling down from the structure. Levitation of particles coated by a conducting
polymer was not observed in an rf discharge for the conditions at which the dielectric particles of the same size and
mass could levitate. Instead, the conducting particles stuck to the electrode, preserving vertical orientation, and some
stuck to each other forming multiparticle fractal clusters with up to 10 particles.

The preferential orientation of cylindrical particles is determined by an interplay between the interaction of nonuni—
form electric ﬁeld ¢(h) in striations or sheaths with a particle charge eZ and induced dipole d and quadrupole D moments
[45 6]. The equilibrium state of the rod—the levitation height kg and the orientation angle 060 with respect to the vertical
axis, can be found considering the total potential energy of the particle, which includes the gravity contribution, mgh.
For simplicity, we assume no dependence of the particle charge on k and 06. Then the energy is determined by expansion
[45 6]

with E < O and E ’ > O. The magnitudes of the dipole and quadrupole moments are [458,459] d 2 %E L3 / A < O and
D 2 %eZL2 < 0, where A = ln(L/a) with L and a the rod length and radius, respectively. The equilibrium states are
determined by extrema of Eq. (94). From oU/oh = 0 (force balance) we get the levitation height ho, which is implicitly
determined by m g = eZ E 0 + d E 6 coszoc (subscript 0 denotes that the functions are taken at h 2 ho). This equation shows
that in addition to the gravity and the monopole electric forces, the dipole force contributes to the balance in vertical
direction. However, this force does not affect the balance noticeably and the levitation height is mostly determined by
the balance of the gravity and the electric force on the total charge, like for a spherical particle.

The equilibrium orientation is given by the condition dU/ooc = 0 (torque balance), which yields two angles, am 2 0
and 7t/2, i.e., the vertical or horizontal orientation of the rod is only possible. The condition for the stable angle we get
from the second derivative: 62 U / ea? o< (K — 1) cos 2060 > 0. Here we introduced the “orientation parameter”:

K 26MB _ elEolL 5E
- D — ( ,, T. ) L ,

where yr 2 2A62|Z| /LTe is the dimensionless particle potential and ZE = |E0/E6| is the spatial scale of the ﬁeld
variation (in the approximation of a “weakly inhomogeneous ﬁeld” ZE > L). This shows that the quadrupole moment
is important for the orientation—the equilibrium is determined by the competition between the dipole and quadrupole
terms in Eq. (94). The dipole torque turns the rod along the electric ﬁeld, whereas the quadrupole torque tends to make
it horizontal. Hence, particles leVitate horizontally, am 2 71/2, when K < 1, and vertically, am 2 0, when K > 1. Using
the equilibrium condition in the vertical direction, m g 2 eZEO, we eliminate the dependence on E0 in the expression
for K, and applying the relation between 32,, and |Z l we derive the following scaling: K o< A2a4E6_1(ere)_3. If we
assume that yr does not depend on L and E 6 = const (the latter is usually true for if sheaths), then K o< A2. Therefore,
the relative contribution of the dipole term is stronger for a longer rod: if A is sufﬁciently large the rod can leVitate
vertically, but for smaller A the horizontal orientation is more preferable. Let us apply these results for the analysis
of particle orientation observed in experiments. In a dc discharge, the particle charge is typically larger than in an if
discharge, allowing particle leVitation in weaker electric ﬁelds. In this case, the dipole moment, which is proportional to
the electric ﬁeld strength squared, is much smaller than in an if discharge. This can explain the different orientations of
similar—sized particles: horizontal in a dc discharge, and vertical in an if discharge. For long particles in if sheaths, i.e.,
when the ﬁeld is strongly inhomogeneous (K E < L), the balance of torques which determines the rod orientation is quite
different. Let us consider the vertically oriented rod in the limit ZE < L. In this case, a signiﬁcant electric ﬁeld eXists
only in a Vicinity of the lower tip of the rod. Therefore, the torque due to the dipole moment should be relatively small
(compared to the weakly inhomogeneous case). In contrast, the quadrupole moment torque should be increased, since
the centre of the electric force will be shifted from the centre downward to the lower tip. Thus, the vertical orientation
is obViously unstable in the strongly inhomogeneous case, and the only possible orientation is the horizontal one.

Experimental observation of plasma crystals composed of elongated particles [451—453] and levitating in do striations
or in if sheaths stimulated theoretical study of the wake potentials produced by rod—like charged particles [190,455]. In
general, the appearance of a dipole moment affects the character of the wake—in particular, this provides the additional
rotational degree of freedom related to the rotational inclination of the rod. This can lead to new effects. For instance,
in addition to the longitudinal and transverse Vibration modes, the lattices composed of rods can have new modes
associated with their rotational motion, similar to those in liquid crystals [460,461]. Excitation and interactions of all
these modes introduce new phase transitions and inﬂuence those existing in lattices composed of spherical grains. Also,
since the wake can affect the interaction of the horizontal (longitudinal) and vertical (transverse) modes for spherical
grains [341], the similar effects should exist for cylindrical particles as well.
15. Possible applications

Dusty plasmas have been present in various industrial applications for many decades. These are, e.g., precipitation of
aerosol particles in combustion products of electric power stations, plasma spraying, and electrostatic painting. In the
beginning of the 1990s it became clear that a large part of contamination found on the surface of silicon wafers after the
manufacturing was not because of insuﬁcicient cleaning, but in fact was an inevitable consequence of plasma etching
and deposition technologies. In most capacitively coupled rf discharge reactors, all particles are charged negatively
and levitate close to one of the electrodes. After switching off the discharge they are deposited on the wafer surface.
Submicron particles deposited on the wafer can reduce the working surface, cause dislocations and voids, and reduce
adhesion of thin ﬁlms. Enormous efforts put forth on reduction of the number of undesirable dust particles in industrial
plasma reactors have recently brought positive results [6—8,462].

In recent years it has become obVious that the presence of dust in plasmas does not necessarily have undesirable
consequences. Powders produced by employing plasma technologies can have interesting and useful properties: very
small sizes (from a nanometer to micrometer range), monodispersity, and high chemical activity. The size, structure and

"
"89","VE. Forlov el al. /Physz'cs Reports 42] (2005) I —103 89
composition of the powder can be varied easily in compliance with the speciﬁc requirements of a certain technology.
In this connection, two trends can be distinguished in applied dusty plasma research [8,462]. The ﬁrst one represents
a development of well-established technologies of surface modiﬁcation, with the dust particles being now the subject
of treatment. In order to create particles with speciﬁc properties, coating, surface activation, etching, modiﬁcation, or
separation of clustered grains in plasmas can be adapted. The second important trend is the creation of new nanostructure
materials, like thin ﬁlms with an inclusion of nanometer—size particles. The typical size of the elements of integrated
circuits in microelectronics is reduced every year and in the nearest future it will likely reach 10 nm. Furthermore, there
is a tendency to replace capacitively coupled rf discharges by inductively coupled ones: the particle trapping is more
diﬂcicult in capacitive discharges, which leads to a signiﬁcant amount of the particles dropping on the surface of the
silicon wafer during plasma processing. Thus, the solution introduced in the 1990s, which was mostly based on dust
particle conﬁnement in special traps, does not work for these devices. This poses a serious problem for the production
of integrated circuits of the next generation, which demands further applied research of the properties of dusty plasmas.

It is known that dust particles are present in the magnetic conﬁnement fusion devices [190,463—469]. Their origin
is mostly the plasma—surface interaction. In the framework of the development of the International Thermonuclear
Experimental Reactor (ITER) project it became obVious that dust represents a serious safety hazard. ITER, as most of
existing fusion devices, will have the wall parts made of graphite and carbon composites. The tritium implantation into
the carbonaceous dust can result in appearance of dust particles where for one atom of carbon there are two atoms of
tritium. The mass of tritium in large devices like ITER may be as high as dozens of kilograms. Such a high amount
raises serious problems related to the safety of the operation—due to the high mobility and chemical reactivity, dust
may operate as a potential carrier of tritium in the case of a severe reactor failure, contaminating substantial areas.
Dust can also affect the plasma performance and stability, as well as the operation of fusion devices. Thus, the problem
of dust removal from thermonuclear devices represents one of the most important scientiﬁc and technical problem.
The main factor being used for its successful solution is presence of the electrical charge at the dust particles. In these
conditions, the equilibrium particle charge is determined by competition of secondary electron emission and electron
and ion absorbtion from the ambient plasma.

For the electric power supply of spacecrafts, automatic weather stations, antisubmarine buoys, etc., compact au-
tonomous power—supply sources with a power about 1—10 kW and an operating lifetime of several years are necessary.
At present, photoelectric converters of solar energy, thermoelectric sources with fuel elements made of 90 Sr, 238Pu,
or 210Po, and thermoionic converters with 235 U reactor used as the heat source, are provided. All these sources have
disadvantages, in particular, very low eﬂciciency. Moreover, a nuclear reactor is very complicated to produce. Recently,
a new method of the nuclear—to-electric energy conversion was proposed [470,471]. The operating principle of the
novel atomic battery is as follows: high-energy particles, which are formed during the decay of a radioactive material,
ionize an inert gas such as xenon. The dissociative recombination of formed diatomic xenon ions results in the effective
excitation of xenon excimers which emit vacuum ultraviolet photons with a wavelength of about 172 nm. These photons
are absorbed on a wide band-gap diamond-based photoconverter and generate electron—hole pairs. Estimates indicate
that the total eﬂciciency of a battery utilizing this principle may be as high as 25—3 5%.

In order to use solid isotopes in the photovoltaic converters, it is necessary to have the isotope surface area as large
as possible. This is because the mean free path of the ionizing particles in the isotope material is very short (e.g., the
mean free path of ﬁ-radiation with the mean decay energy in 90 Sr is about 180 um). Therefore, a homogeneous mixture
of gas and isotope dust is a very good option. Excitation of the gas mixture is performed by 06- or ﬁ-radiation from the
radioactive dust. Estimates show that at a dust size of 1—20 um and dust number density of 105—109 cm‘3 it is possible
to obtain the power density of ~1 W / m3. The gas pressure has to be on the order of 1—1 0 bar to ensure effective energy
conversion of ﬁ- or oc-radiation into UV radiation. The main technical problem here is to have a homogeneous gas—dust
mixture at high gas pressures. Recent experiments performed in such systems demonstrate that this is possible [85 ,86].
Processes of self—organization occurring in the nuclear—induced plasmas result in the formation of stationary structures
and, hence, provide relatively homogeneous redistribution of particles over the plasma volume.

16. Interdisciplinarity and perspectives

In this review we have naturally concentrated on complex plasmas as a new physical, non-Hamiltonian state of matter

that has already provided researchers over the last 10 years or so with many new challenges—both experimentally and

"
"90","90 VE. Forlov el al. /Physz'cs Reports 421 (2005) I —103

theoretically. We have discussed broad spectrum of numerous physical phenomena occurring in complex plasma, and
have also pointed out some of the currently predictable developments expected on this new and exciting ﬁeld in the
next few years.

There is another issue, however, that promises to become as important—possibly even more so— than the investi-
gation of complex plasmas per se. This we have termed “interdisczplinarily”, which means transferring some insights
obtained from complex plasma research to other ﬁelds. This presupposes, of course, that we have “generic” processes
or that understanding a particular process in one ﬁeld will help with new and novel insights in another area.

The reasons why this “interdisciplinarity” could be of particular signiﬁcance for complex plasmas are:

0 Complex plasmas can be studied experimentally at the kinetic (indiVidual particle) level—something that for most

systems is only possible when they are static or, at best, eXhibit secular variations.

0 Complex plasmas are optically thin up to sizes of a few 10’s of cm—corresponding, e.g., to crystals with a few
1000 lattice planes. By selectively illuminating central or peripheral parts one can Visualize particular regions of
interest for detailed investigations.

0 The characteristic time and length scales of complex plasmas are “stretched” with respect to e.g., atomic or molec-
ular systems—by typically a factor of a million (atomic systems have scales ~ A and complex plasmas ~ 100 um;
typical plasma frequencies at plasma densities of 1012 cm‘3 are ~108 Hz and complex plasma frequencies at
similar charge densities are ~ 100 Hz). This allows studies at all the relevant physical parameters in “slow motion”
and “high resolution”—and makes the transfer of insights gained from these otherwise inaccessible measurements
(in particular for nonlinear processes) extremely valuable.

0 Complex plasmas can be “engineered” in different ways, e.g., as predominantly one-component systems, as
two-component systenis, multi-component systenis, anisotropic systenis, stratiﬁed systems, etc. Hence, different
dynamical properties can be studied under controlled conditions. This increases the scope for “interdisciplinarity”
considerably.

0 There is a class of problems (nano-dynamics) where progress requires studies at the kinetic level—and so far only
complex plasmas offer the chance to do this directly, without using proxy data or accepting interference of the
measurements on the process under study.

0 Finally, there is a growing belief that self—organization, scale-free behaviour, universality and fractal structure
growth are generic properties of matter that depend on the interaction forces and external (control) parameters
only regarding their deﬁned “modus operandi” and that the underlying principles are the same. Investigations at
the most fundamental kinetic level can then be regarded as a “missing link” in our understanding of universality
processes, one that complex plasmas may be able to provide.

Based on the known physical properties of complex plasmas discussed in the reView, it is clear then that the

“interdisciplinarity” may be categorized in at least seven areas:

Crystals. It has already been shown that many aspects of crystal physics (e.g., waves) are well reproduced at the
kinetic level. The exciting tasks for the future lie in the areas of understanding the role of defects in the thermodynamics,
investigate nonlinear wave interaction, magnetized and anisotropic crystals, etc. A number of these investigations will
have an analogue in crystal physics and will lead to better understanding in time.

Crystallization/melting. So far, it was Virtually impossible to investigate this at the kinetic level, although even without
such research a great deal has been learned about different types of crystal growth (from epitaxial to dendritic), cluster
formation, etc. Nevertheless, it is quite clear that detailed kinetic studies of phase transitions with complex plasmas
will complement our understanding of the elementary processes considerably. This includes nucleation as well as the
dynamics and structure of crystallization fronts.

F luids. The onset of cooperative phenomena in ﬂuid ﬂows is one of the prime domains where complex plasmas
can contribute substantial new physical insights. The same is true, however, for self-organization of ﬂuid ﬂows from
laminar shears to turbulence, one of the outstanding problems of hydrodynamics. Investigations at the kinetic level
promise a rich ﬁeld of research in the years to come. The issues to investigate are, e.g., the onset of Kelvin—Helniholtz
and Rayleigh—Taylor instabilities, interpenetrating ﬂows, nonequilibrium phase transitions, etc., as well as the study of
multi-ﬂuid systems and their interfaces.

Liquid/gas transitions. Here the physical processes occurring at the “critical point” are of great fundamental interest.
The main questions are: what is the universality class of complex plasmas? Is there a critical point in the system—and

"
"91","VE. Forlov el al. /Physz'cs Reports 421 (2005) 1—103 91
if so, what are the bulk properties? What is the role of ﬁnite particle size? How does particle inertia affect the physics?
and ﬁnally—What is the kinetic origin of the scale-free behaviour found at the critical point? There are other topics
also, of course, such as condensation, wave propagation, etc.

Surfaces. One of the most exciting topics here is the study of the onset of “surface cooperative behaviour” when
3D clusters grow larger to become liquid or crystalline balls. This includes the development of surface global modes
from a few discrete modes to ﬁnally a continuum treatment, issues that are equally interesting for physics as well as
engineering.

Magnetization. The physics of cooperative phenomena and strong coupling under conditions when the gyroradius
of thermal particles becomes smaller than their equilibrium separation is another “interdisciplinary” topic of interest
in plasma physics, astrophysics, and solid states. Here, too, insights gained from kinetic measurements (ranging from
mode coupling of different waves to ﬂow properties) can be extremely valuable in understanding other natural systems.

Exotic systems. In future space experiments it may be possible to experiment with so-called “quantum gases”
consisting of interacting Bose—Einstein condensates, each condensate consisting of many billions Rb atoms, for instance.
Whilst this does not yet constitute a “quantum plasnia”—the BECs are uncharged—it is nevertheless interesting to
speculate on and to investigate what happens when, e.g., cold electrons are introduced into the system, or photoionization
is attempted.

It must be recognized that efforts should be made in the near future for experts from various ﬁelds to discuss these
“interdisciplinary” issues.

17. Conclusion

Despite an almost a century-long history—the ﬁrst observations of dust in discharges were reported by Langmuir in
1924 [472], the investigation of dusty plasmas has acquired substantial attention only during the last decade, after the
experimental discovery of the plasma crystals. The simplicity of Visualization in complex plasmas provides us with
unique opportunity to observe the ongoing processes at the individual particle level. This makes possible the detailed
analysis of thermodynamics and kinetics in the crystalline and liquid phases, provides insights into the mesoscopic
behaviour and onset of cooperative phenomena, yields crucial information about “microscopic” processes driving
critical phenomena and self—organization, etc.

We should, however, also take the long View. Complex plasma research has already made remarkable progress in
the investigations of some fundamental and generic processes—ranging from nanoﬂuidics to crystallization at the
kinetic level. This growth of knowledge, which has just begun, will ultimately help us to advance into other ﬁelds. This
highlights the “interdisciplinarity” of the complex plasma research.

Advances in understanding the basic processes in complex plasmas can lead to a much broader application po-
tential than dedicated technological development is often able to achieve. Complex plasma research—especially the
fundamental insights gained through novel experiments in space, providing long observation times and conditions not
available on Earth—has already shown that.

The authors tried not only to discuss the current status in the ﬁeld, by highlighting the most signiﬁcant experimental
and theoretical results, but also pointed out some important issues to be solved. Now complex plasmas are one of the
most rapidly growing ﬁelds in physics—on average, with more than one publication appearing every day. There is no
doubt, therefore, that these studies will provide new insights into various ﬁelds of basic research in the future.
