Abstract: The Hyperspectral Imager for the Coastal Ocean (HICO) is ﬂying on the International

Space Station. Here we give a brief overview of HICO on-orbit performance and suggest future

directions for imaging the coastal ocean.

1. Introduction
The Hyperspectral Imager for the Coastal Ocean (HICO) is the ﬁrst spaceborne imaging spectrometer designed to
sample the coastal ocean. HICO samples selected coastal regions at 95 m with full spectral coverage (88 channels
covering 400 to 900 nm) and a high signal-to—noise ratio to resolve the complexity of the coastal ocean. HICO has
been operating on the International Space Station (188) since September 17, 2009 and collected over 5000 scenes.
HICO was sponsored by the Ofﬁce of Naval Research and built as an Innovative Naval Prototype to demonstrate a
rapid and low cost approach to building space instruments. HICO was built calibrated, characterized, tested for
space ﬂight and delivered for integration in 16 months. HICO was integrated into the HICO and RAIDS
Experiment Payload (HREP) which was installed on the 188 one year later. As a demonstrator HICO was designed
to operate for 1 year; it has currently been operating for 29 months. Additionally HICO was designed to meet
speciﬁc performance requirements and has met or exceeded all requirements. The data is now being used to
demonstrate the utility of 95 m hyperspectral data for the coastal ocean.
HICO passed all the usual reViews and testing for a space instrument and it was well calibrated and characterized in
the laboratory. However, due to the very limited budget HICO does not include an on-board calibrator, and because
of its location on the 188 it cannot image the full moon monthly for calibration. Because of these limitations HICO
has required on-orbit calibration using Fraunhofer lines for spectral calibration and stable land scenes for
radiometric calibration. Those corrections are detailed in a submitted publication [1] and outlined brieﬂy below.
2. On-orbit Calibration and Example Data
HICO was spectrally and radiometrically calibrated in the laboratory before launch. After launch and installation on
the 188 small shifts in alignment (a few microns) were detected resulting in changes in spectral calibration and ﬁeld
of View. To provide useful data HICO has been recalibrated 0n orbit.
For the spectral calibration full resolution HICO data (1.7 nm spectral sampling) is collected over bright land or
cloud scenes. Spectral matching techniques are used to match absorption features in the HICO spectra to the known
Fraunhofer and atmospheric absorption features [1]. This is done on a regular schedule. An initial shift of 1.7 nm
was noticed in the spectral calibration as HICO adjusted to the conditions on the 188. This shift decreased slightly
over the ﬁrst 90 days, and then stabilized at 0.94 nm. The data is corrected using a table of spectral calibration over
time to assure the correct spectra for any given data set.
Although HICO is an ocean color instrument, it has a very high dynamic range and does not saturate over high
reﬂectivity scenes including most clouds and desert areas. This permitted the use of a number of stable desert
calibration sites previously used by the Landsat Science Team, the NASA EO-l Science Team, and the NASA JPL
AVIRIS Team, for inter-satellite data comparisons. In particular comparisons were made with MODIS land
channels (ocean channels saturated) for sites where we collected near simultaneous HICO and MODIS data. Using
this data HICO on-orbit calibration was found to be different from the laboratory calibration. Adjustments were
made to the dark correction, second order light correction and radiometric calibration [1]. Comparison of HICO t0
MODIS data from ocean scenes not used in the calibration process (Fig. 1) show excellent agreement, and HICO
appears stable and providing good quality data.
Because of the limitations of operating on the ISS and the lack of a full data system HICO data is used strictly for
demonstration purposes. Applications that have been demonstrated include shallow water bathynietry, analysis of
river plumes and identiﬁcation of harmful algal blooms. One example is the HICO image taken September 3, 2011

of a massive Microcystis bloom in Lake Erie (Fig. 2). The bloom was developing over several weeks and was
already a concern to water resource managers and scientists working on the Great lakes. Lake Erie is a maj or source
of drinking water and Microcystis is a toxic algae. The HICO image provides a clear spectral signature to track the
bloom. It also has the area coverage and spatial sampling to show the full extent of the bloom and the physical
mixing processes that are forming eddies transporting the Microcystis into the eastern part of the Lake.

3. Summary and Future Directions
HICO has met and exceeded all ONR Innovative Naval Prototype (INP) goals: It was built and delivered in 16
months (goal 18 months), it has operated for over a year in space (currently 29 months), sensor performance and
data quality is as expected from models and lab measurements, and the sensor is stable and providing useful science
quality data for over 50 users worldwide. A detailed description of the HICO instrument has been published [2] and
a project overview was published in AGU E08 [3]. Detailed description of the on-orbit performance and calibration
is completed and submitted for publication [1] and the operation of HICO has been extended to three years. HICO
data are available at http://hico.coas.oregonstate.edu and the site includes publications, data access, example data
and directions on how to use the data.
However, since HICO was built in 16 months and very limited budget many corners had to be cut. HICO used
commercial off—the-shelf parts wherever possible and the computers and pointing motor are not space qualiﬁed, and
both experience occasional malfunctions believed to be the result of radiation exposure and must be reset. The 188
orbit (+/— 52 deg. and slowly progressing) limit daylight Viewing opportunities and Space Station activities can
further limit imaging opportunities. Also HICO’s 95 m GSD is adequate for the coastal ocean but not adequate
when imaging the bottom or adj acent marshes and land areas where 30 m GSD is required. HICO does not have on-
orbit calibration capabilities, and there is no data beyond 900 nm for atmospheric correction and land data. Because
of the limited budget HICO data is calibrated but not atmospherically corrected or geolocated except on request for
indiVidual scenes. There is no funding for routine reprocessing and producing a Climate Data set, or long term
archiving of the data.
To address these limitations we recommend a new Coastal Hyperspectral Imager (CHI) on a small free-ﬂying
spacecraft which would have a number of key advantages over HICO:

1. Broader spectral bandwidth. CHI would collect data from 380 to 1650 nm. The longer infrared wavelengths
would improve atmospheric correction and make it possible to characterize beaches and plants along the
shoreline and snow and ice in alpine regions and in the Arctic.

2. Finer spatial resolution. CHI will collect data with 30-m GSD, which will be able to re-solve ocean bottoni,
coastal, glacier and arctic features.

3. Optimized orbit. CHI would ﬂy on a small dedicated satellite in a near-noon equatorial crossing time polar
orbit. It will be able to image locations in high latitudes every day and locations in mid to low latitudes
every 2nd or 3rd day.

4. Wide ﬁeld of regard. Agile spacecraft would be able to rotate CHI through 60 degrees, from -30° to +30°
from nadir, to allow rapid revisit (1-3 days) to study sites. It could also point fore or aft 20° to avoid
sunglint.

5. Optimized radiometric calibration. The agile spacecraft could allow moon imaging; CHI radiometric
calibration maintained on-orbit by scanning the full moon once a month.

6. Optimized spectral calibration. CHI will calibrate signal wavelengths on-orbit to within 0.2 nm by
comparing observed and known spectral features including Fraunhofer absorption lines and atmospheric
absorption features.

7. Complete data processing system. HICO data processed to level 1B; CHI would have a full data system,
with all data processed to geolocated end products. This would include reprocessing as needed and
archiving in a climate data center.
