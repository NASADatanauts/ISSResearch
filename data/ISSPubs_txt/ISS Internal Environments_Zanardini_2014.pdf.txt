E This paper focuses on the details of a Cabin Heat eXchanger (CHX) Dryout in Colum-
:1 bus, the European Laboratory part of the International Space Station (188), and the unique
§ and challenging conditions, which occur during a high beta angle phase. A particular case
§ happening between DOY154 and DOY163 of the year 2013 will be analyzed. Furthermore
if the paper illustrates how these difﬁcult conditions can be overcome by the Flight Control
g Team at the Columbus Control Centre (COL-CC).
ED A CHX Dryout and some of the challenges, which have been encountered during this
:0 speciﬁc high beta angle phase, are described below.

3 The CHX Dryout is a regular maintenance activity, which is performed every 6 weeks
g (+/— 1 week) to change from one CHX core to the other. This activity is done after an
5’ extended period of time of the active CHX Core being exposed to water, in order to prevent
3:2“ microbial and fungal growth on the CHX hydrophilic coating. Such fungus growth may
; cause hardware damage and possible crew health issues, therefore is particularly important
§ that a Dryout is regularly scheduled. The activity is nominally preceded by a Wet cycle
‘1’: phase lasting 7 days, in which the set point of the CHX control law is decreases to induce
‘2“ more condensation in the active core and to ﬂush the core prior to its deactivation. In the
E particular case described here, the wet cycle has been skipped due to some anomalies in the
E TCS subsystem, which resulted in the impossibility of changing the CHX inlet temperature
(53 set point.
8 At initiation of the CHX Dryout, the alternate Columbus Water Separator Assembly
E (CWSA) is activated, and the active CHX core, through which water is ﬂowing, is swapped
2 from one to the other. During the Dryout, both CWSAl & CWSA2 are left active for a
8 minimum of 16 hours. Having both CWSA on for that long amount of time ensures
g collection and separation of the condensate from the CHX to be dried out.
2 At the end of the Dryout, the CWSA corresponding to the dried core is deactivated.
Q An increase of humidity in the cabin is observed in the ﬁrst few hours of the Dryout,
E which results in a higher dew point in the cabin. During high beta angle period, the Heater
3 Control Unit (HCU) temperatures in certain areas, which are constantly shaded, are lower
3 than usual. To avoid condensation of the Columbus external shell, the difference between
E the dew point and the lowest temperature on any of the heater strings shall be maintained
Q at least at 44°C.

While performing the Dryout during a high beta angle period, this requirement can be
violated and corrective measures have to be taken to activate parts of the redundant HCU,
supporting the active HCU in heating up the shell and avoid the risk of condensation.
Another additional challenge in performing a Dryout during an high beta angle phase is
the fact that, when the redundant HCU is turned on, all its 6 heater strings are enabled, so
the initial power draw can be quite high and might exceed the power allocated to Columbus
during such a critical power phase. Only certain strings need to be active, hence all should
be disabled as soon as possible and, in case additional limitations are in place, different
strings have to be activated in sequence to guarantee that the power limits are not violated
and that there is no built up of condensation in Columbus.

% HE International Space Station (188) is a collaboration of ﬁve different International Partners (IPs):

0:: TNational Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) from the USA, Roscosmos from Russia, J apan

‘2“ Aerospace Exploration Agency (J AXA) from J apan, European Space Agency (ESA) from Europe and Cana—

E dian Space Agency (CSA) from Canada, Which all have their own control—Centers. The assembly phase started

E in 1998 and was completed in 2011, With the delivery of its last pressurized module.

{53 The International Space Station has been the most advanced human outpost in space for over a decade

8 and during its current exploitation phase is carrying on several experiments to investigate how the human

(32 body reacts to prolonged exposure to microgravity and radiation. It contains several laboratory modules, one

% of Which is the Columbus module, launched in 2008 as the main contribution to the 188 from the European

% Space Agency. Since then it has been controlled by the Columbus Control Center in Oberpfaﬂ'enhofen near

9 Munich, Germany.

(:5: Hardware designed and manufactured for use in such an environment is exposed to the same conditions

i of microgravity and radiation. Some of the difﬁculties caused by this harsh environment for equipment are

g overcome in the design phase of the speciﬁc hardware, through the use of materials certiﬁed for the speciﬁc

3 application ﬁeld. Other problems are solved by adopting real time reactions While operating the equipment

E to guarantee its best performance With the evolution of the boundary conditions.

Q The Columbus module is equipped With a series of subsystems to maintain the air temperature and
humidity Within an optimal range both for the crew and the electrical equipment. It is crucial that these
tools are kept operational even With unfavorable environmental conditions, in order to guarantee that the
critical functions and crew safety are guaranteed at all times.

In addition, the formation of condensation on the shell of the module must always be avoided, since it
can be the cause of hazard issues, if it gets in contact With electrical equipment.

This happened already once in 2007 When a computer malfunction on the Russian segment left the 188
without thrusters, oxygen generation, carbon dioxide scrubber, and other environmental control systems.
The root cause of the issue was condensation inside the electrical connectors, Which led to a short—Circuit
that triggered the power off command to all three of the redundant processing units.

In order to maintain the full functionality of the air conditioning subsystem in the Columbus module, one
particular operation has to be performed regularly to avoid health problems for the astronauts and hardware
damage: the Cabin Heat Exchanger Dryout process. It is critical for both the crew and the vehicle that this

In the following chapters it Will be analyzed in more detail how the modiﬁed boundary conditions can
deeply inﬂuence the execution of the Columbus Cabin Heat Exchanger Dryout and Which real time challenges
have to be overcome to make sure that this activity is completed successfully.

The ﬁrst part covers a brief introduction of the Columbus subsystems involved in the temperature and
humidity control and the Dryout process is explained With the support of telemetry analysis.

In the second part a speciﬁc Dryout operation during a high beta angle period is taken as an example and
compared With a nominal case; the effects of the modiﬁed conditions and the solutions adopted to overcome
the challenges are analyzed in the last section.

II. ISS Environment and High Beta Angle Overview
INCE 2000 the ISS has been permanently manned, at ﬁrst With 3 crewmembers. After the addition of
Sseveral more pressurized laboratories and modules 6 crewmembers are constantly on board since 2009.
15 Each group of 3 astronauts Who ﬂies up and down together on a dedicated Soyuz vehicle, represents an
E Expedition and each group lives onboard the ISS for about 6 months.
§ The ISS is a seIf—sustaining environment Which produces, for example its own power, maintains a constant
g pressure and air ﬂow and has a complex regenerative system to convert the carbon dioxide into oxygen and
E“, water. Nevertheless a lot of supplies, such as additional quantities of water, oxygen, nitrogen and propellant
5 need to be delivered by the frequent Visiting vehicles: the European Automated Transfer Vehicle (ATV),
8 the J apanese H—II Transfer Vehicle (HTV), the Russian PROGRESS and the recent commercial US vehicles
g DRAGON and CYGNUS.1
g The Columbus module has no own resources: nitrogen, air, power and collection of condensate water
g are provided by the United States Orbital Segment (USOS). Nevertheless, like any other module, Columbus
:2; provides air Circulation, temperature and humidity control, in order to guarantee the crew a comfortable
3 environment While they are performing their daily activities, such as maintenance tasks, exercise and science
é experiments.
2: While the internal environment can be actively controlled by the systems onboard, the external one is
(2: heavily inﬂuenced by the orbital parameters of the ISS. The International Space Station is located in Low
g; Earth Orbit (LEO) at an altitude of about 400 km, its orbit around Earth takes around 90 minutes. The ISS
a is traveling With an average speed of 27744 km/ h and every day the Station completes 15.7 orbits around
E3 the Earth.2
(2) One important parameter Which describes the attitude of the Station With respect to the sun is the beta
(95 angle. This is the angle between the Sun vector, Which is the vector between the earth and the sun and the
g ISS orbital plane. In Figure 1. the ISS beta angle and its variation during a one year period are represented.

While, on the contrary, When the beta angle is approximately zero, the amount of time Which the ISS spends
in eclipse is maximized.

During the early stages of the ISS life, While the Space Shuttle was in service the beta angle played a
very important role in the ﬂight schedule. Every time the beta angle was higher than 60 degrees, the Shuttle
could not be safely launched to the 188 due to the different thermal constraints of the two vehicles and the
fact that their desired attitude to mitigate the effects of the beta angle were not compatible.3

There are still certain effects coming from high beta angles on the 188, Which need to be worked from
the operation teams, With planned actions to minimize its effects on the equipment on board, especially in
terms of power and thermal requirements:

0 Power limitations might become necessary depending on the angle between the sun and the solar arrays,
since the shadowing 0n the ISS solar panels reduces the amount of power generated. These limits are
usually identiﬁed in advance by the Power Resources Ofﬁcer (PRO), a group of ﬂight controllers 0f the
Mission Control Center in Houston (MCC—H). These limitations are then forwarded to all positions in

E Houston and the IPs and each position is responsible for taking the necessary actions on their hardware
:‘r in order to meet the power restrictions.
8
g o The temperature of the modules is impacted as well by the amount and angle of the sunlight it absorbs.
g In the case of Columbus, based on its position on the 188, this means a decrease of the shell temperature
2. in the port area towards Node 2.
o
D
g c There can be communication outages (Ku—Band), because the Ku—Band antenna has to be parked to
g avoid breaching the Antenna low temperature limits. While most of the system telemetry is transmitted
g Via the S—Band antenna, Which is not impacted by this, the science data and the onboard Video are
i: acquired through the Ku—Band antenna, therefore there is a high impact on experiments in such cases.

the Russian Elektron, nitrogen is introduced by Russian assets and carbon dioxide is removed by the Russian
Vozdukh. This fresh air is drawn into Columbus by the IMV Supply Fan Assembly (ISFA), supported by
one Cabin Fan Assembly (CFA). It is combined With N 50% of used air from the Columbus cabin and then
passes into a ﬁlter to remove particles out of the air. A schematic of the Columbus air conditioning system
can be found in Figure 2.

The Temperature Control Valve (TCV) (belonging to the Cabin Heat eXchanger) separates the ﬁltered
air stream into one stream cooled in the active Cabin Heat eXchanger (CHX) core and dehumidiﬁed in
the Condensate Water Separator Assembly (CWSA). The other air stream ﬂows through the core Which is
not cooled. The ratio of the two air streams is based on the difference between the temperature set point
and the actual cabin temperature measured by the Cabin Temperature Sensors. The cool, dry air and the
bypassed air are combined again and diffused into the cabin. The condensate is forwarded to the USOS Via
the Condensate Return Line.

After being coated With water for an extended period of time, microbial and fungal growth can occur

5 on the CHX hydrophilio coating, causing damage and possible crew health problems. A periodic Dryout of
E? the CHX is needed to prevent this fungus growth on either core, therefore this activity is scheduled With a
E periodic interval of 42 days (+/— 1 week).
g During the Dryout operation, Which last about 17 hours, the following actions are performed in sequence:
E 0 During initiation of COL CHX Dryout, the redundant (alternate) CWSA is activated, the cold CHX
g core is swapped by Closing the related Water On/Oﬁ Valve (WOOV), Which determine the cold and
E the warm core, and the so called TCV sweep is performed to invert the movement of the Temperature
§ Control Valve.
g o For the duration of the Dryout, both Condensate Water Separator Assemblies (CWSA1&2) are left
EL active for a minimum of 16 hours. Having the CWSA of the CHX that is being dried out active for at
i least 16 hours ensures that the residual amount of condensate is pushed out of the dried out CHX.
in o The termination phase of the Dryout deactivates the CWSA corresponding to the dried core.
>~.
‘2"" During the activity several parameters deviate from their nominal values; the ones that are meaningful in
3 this speciﬁc case are the cabin temperature, the cabin air humidity and, as a consequence, the dew point.

IV. Columbus Dryout Challenges during High Beta Angle phases
A high beta angle Changes the environmental conditions of the 188, as already mentioned in Chapter II.
Especially during an operation such as the Columbus Dryout, Which already heavily inﬂuences the Columbus
environmental parameters (Chapter III), the contribution of the high beta angle leads to a particularly
EB Challenging situation. The major items of concern are the possible condensation 0n the Columbus shell and
3f the limited power availability.
V.
8
g A. Possible Condensation due to Low Shell Temperature
§ During the high beta angle phase, due to its position With respect to the ISS structure, the Columbus module
<2 is shadowed by the ISS structure. This conﬁguration impacts the temperature of the shell, especially on
E the port cone side (the side Which is attached to Node 2). The inﬂuence of the Beta Angle is so signiﬁcant
g that the Shell Heater temperature cannot be maintained Within the set limits. In fact, during this phase the
§ temperature on the port cone regularly decreases below the nominal 10W limit of 200C.
5? To avoid condensation and freezing on the module shell, the Columbus module is equipped With a network
g of heaters, a total of 156 heaters (78 primary and 78 secondary) grouped in 12 Circuits, also called strings (6
E: primary and 6 secondary). Figure 6 shows an overview of the distributions of the heater elements and the
;. HCUs on Columbus. The small, black triangles indicate the heaters.

Figure 6. Columbus Shell Heater positions (source: ESA)
The shell heaters are controlled by the Heater Control Unit (HCU), Which switches the circuits on and
off, based on the shell temperature upper and lower set—points that are monitored by temperature sensors
(Thermistors). In order to guarantee that the Columbus shell is not subject to condensation, the readings
of each thermistor have to be above the dew point plus a temperature error of 4.4OC at any time. The

"8","temperature error considers the uncertainty on the thermistor measurement, the dew point calculation, the
gradient between the coldest spot on the shell and the sensor location. During the high beta angle phase,
the temperature of the shell is lower than usual and during the Dryout phase the dew point is higher than
normal (as pictured in Figure 5). This combination of events causes the reduction of the delta between the
two values and it can happen that the delta reaches values lower than the margin of 4.4OC. This can be seen
in Figure 7 as She11_to_DeWPoint_DV graph, Which represents the difference between the lowest shell heater
temperature and the dew point plus the margin. If this value goes below zero, as in the left example during
a high beta angle period, the shell is at risk of condensation.

3 B. Limited Power Availability
LU
E As mentioned above, another impact of the high beta angle on the entire 188 power distribution system is
C; the fact that, due to the unfavorable position of the Solar Arrays and the additional shadowing caused by

E: 1. Enabling Temperature Control Law
% When the HCU temperature control is disabled the temperature starts to decrease immediately. In
5 case any of the thermistors shows a temperature Close to the dew point plus the 44°C error during
5 a Dryout the corresponding string would need to be activated by enabling the temperature control
2 law for that speciﬁc string. As this Will draw about 160W and could breach the given power limits,
% the possible use of an additional 160W need to be pre—coordinated and agreed upon With the Power
Q Resources Ofﬁcer in MCC—H before the power—down would start.
i 2. Performing a Ere—IIeat before the Power—Dewn .
g» A second p0ss1b1hty to prevent the s1tuat10n that any temperature on the shell might get too 10W
:3 is to perform a pre—heat before the power—down. This means that the shell temperature set points
i; are increased to a range between 250C and 280C for six hours before the power—down. This ensures
E that the shell temperatures are above thermal limits for at least 7 hours. With a pre—heat the shell
temperature is higher than usual and When the heaters are turned off for the power—down, a longer
time is needed for the temperature to decrease to the critical temperature, When condensation could
occur.

In Figure 9 an example of a pre—heat can be found. The thermistors shown are the ones around the port
cone, Which is usually the coldest part of the Columbus shell.

In case of a CHX Dryout, it has been seen that the critical phase in terms of temperature and dew point
values, lasts only a few hours, therefore, pre—heating the Columbus shell is an effective real time solution to
avoid condensation during a Dryout in high beta angle periods.

g: VI. Conclusion
c; A Dryout is an activity Which is important to perform regularly (42 days With a margin of one week)
8 to avoid microbiological and fungal growth contamination of the wet CHX core. The operational solutions
E3 described in this paper represent a series of actions Which can be taken to avoid delaying this important
é maintenance activity due to environmental conditions.
(L3 As speciﬁed in the previous Chapters, the hazard of condensation during a Dryout in Columbus is a
E serious issue, especially When this activity is performed during particularly critical timeframes, such as a
% high beta angle periods.
% Nevertheless, Columbus Flight Controllers have developed several operational workarounds, Which allow
(3 this activity to be performed Without any condensation risk to the Columbus module: the Heater Control
:5 Unit is the key to prevent possible condensation 0n the shell during a Dryout. Especially during the initial
<2: phase of the Dryout, When the risk of condensing 0n the shell is higher, the redundant control unit can be
ﬂ activated to assist heating up low temperature areas of the shell.
3 If the shell temperature decreases towards the critical limit in cases Where power limitations are in place
E and the tern erature control law of the active HCU has been disabled additional ower can be allocated
3 p 7 p
9 after coordination With MCC—H counterparts to be able to activate the individual heater strings. Another
possibility is to perform a pre—heat 0f the shell in advance to allow a straightforward execution of the Dryout
With a higher initial temperature of the shell.

To be able to prevent the condensation issue in real time the Flight Controllers constantly monitor the
dew point and the temperature of the shell and can intervene to recover the situation When needed With the
solutions described above.
