Abstract

Creation of effective life support systems (LSSs) is one of the main tasks of mediCO-biological support of long-duration space
ﬂight. Principles of development of such an LSS will be deﬁned on the basis of number of parameters, including mass-overall
and energetic limitations of interplanetary spacecraft, duration of expedition and crew size.

It is Obvious that including biological subsystems in LSS 0f long-duration interplanetary space ﬂights will help to form a full-
ﬂedged environment for humans in the spacecraft. It would be an appropriate solution for long-term biological needs of humans
and important for elimination of possible negative consequences of their long stay under artiﬁcial (abiogenous) environment.

Experiments with higher plants, conducted on board “MIR” orbital complex and Russian segment of 188, showed that plant
organisms are capable of long-duration normal growth, full development and reproduction without deviations under real space
ﬂight environment. These results allow us to assume that greenhouses are potential candidates to be a biological subsystem to
be included in the LSS for interplanetary space ﬂight.

Inclusion of greenhouse equipment in the spacecrafts will require a number of corrective actions in functional schemes of the
existing LSS, i.e. it will lead to redistribution of material streams inside an LSS and increase in functional load of authorized
systems. Furthermore, involvement of greenhouse in an LSS of an interplanetary spacecraft requires a number of technical tasks
to be Cleared. In the present review, we discuss the constructive, technological and mass-transfer characteristics of greenhouse
as a component part of the LSS for crews of long-term interplanetary missions, in particular, Mars expedition.
