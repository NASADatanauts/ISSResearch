Abstract
The low—Earth orbit (LEO) radiation environment has been directly observed by the Intra—Vehicular (IV) and Extra—Vehicular (EV)
Charged Particle Directional Spectrometers (CPDS) aboard the International Space Station (ISS). The EV instrument is mounted on the
SO truss 0f the ISS and consists of three separate silicon detector telescopes which are oriented in different directions. The IV instrument
is a single silicon detector telescope located inside the US Laboratory module of the ISS. We report on the current state of the data anal—
ysis for these instruments, which includes the proton stopping particle spectrum, relative carbon, nitrogen, and oxygen ion (CNO) abun—
dances, and linear energy transfer (LET) spectra.
