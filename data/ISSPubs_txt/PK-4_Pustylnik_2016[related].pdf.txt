New compleX—plasma facility, Plasmakristall—4 (PK—4), has been recently commissioned on board the
International Space Station. In complex plasmas, the subsystem of ,urn—sized microparticles immersed
in low—pressure weakly ionized gas—discharge plasmas becomes strongly coupled due to the high
(103—104 e) electric Charge on the microparticle surface. The microparticle subsystem of complex
plasmas is available for the observation at the kinetic level, which makes complex plasmas appropriate
for particle—resolved modeling of Classical condensed matter phenomena. The main purpose of PK—4
is the investigation of ﬂowing complex plasmas. To generate plasma, PK—4 makes use of a Classical
dc discharge in a glass tube, whose polarity can be switched with the frequency of the order of
100 Hz. This frequency is high enough not to be felt by the relatively heavy microparticles. The
duty cycle of the polarity switching can be also varied allowing to vary the drift velocity of the
microparticles and (when necessary) to trap them. The facility is equipped with two Videocameras
and illumination laser for the microparticle imaging, kaleidoscopic plasma glow observation sys—
tem and minispectrometer for plasma diagnostics and various microparticle manipulation devices
(e.g., powerful manipulation laser). Scientiﬁc experiments are programmed in the form of scripts
written with the help of specially developed C scripting language libraries. PK—4 is mainly operated
from the ground (control center CADMOS in Toulouse, France) with the support of the space station
crew. Data recorded during the experiments are later on delivered to the ground on the removable
hard disk drives and distributed to participating scientists for the detailed analysis. Published by AIP
