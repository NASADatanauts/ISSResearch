Abstract
Gene expression analysis using microarrays has proved to be an important method in life science. The opportunity to grow higher
plants on the International Space Station (ISS) opens up the possibility for gene expression proﬁling of plants grown in microgravity.
The work presented focuses on how to meet the scientiﬁc requirements of plant growth and the sample preservation, given the technical
and operational constraints associated with space research. The growth chamber (Multigen—2 Science Testing Unit) and a protocol sug—
gested to be used in the European Modular Cultivation System (EMCS) Multigen—2 experiment on the ISS to grow and later preserve
Arabidopsis seedlings, were tested on ground. The results showed that most of the plants developed normally. In order to avoid high
population stress the number of seedlings per growth area should be reduced. The RNAlater preservation method to be used in the space
experiment was compared with a quick freeze in Liquid Nitrogen (LN2). The RNA from samples preserved in RNAlater at room tem—
perature for 24 h was slightly more degraded than the RNA from the LN2 preserved samples (RNA integrity number, RIN: 7.7 and 8.6,
respectively). However, the RNA quality and quantity was satisfactory for microarray analysis. Of the genes analysed, 74 genes (0.28%)
were signiﬁcantly differentially expressed, most of them showing moderate to low regulation. Among the genes induced in the RNAlater
preserved samples, three salt inducible transcription factors (ZAT10, SZFl and SZF2) were identiﬁed, suggesting that the high salt con—
centration in RNAlater causes salt stress before the transcription stopped. In conclusion, the Multigen—2 preservation protocol tested
here will allow for the genes regulated by microgravity in the space experiment to be revealed. The results (10 indicate that not all the
biological processes are stopped instantly by the RNAlater. The limited diffusion indirectly caused by the microgravity may potentially
result in a different degree of salt stress in the test compared to the 1 X g control during the space experiment. This has to be accounted
for during the evaluation of the results. Since slightly degraded RNA was observed, further optimalisation of the preservation protocol
will be performed.
