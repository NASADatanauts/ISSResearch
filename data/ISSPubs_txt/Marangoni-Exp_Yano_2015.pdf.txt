This paper reports the experimental results on the instability and associated r011

structures (RSS) of Marangoni convection in liquid bridges formed under the micro—

gravity environment on the International Space Station. The geometry of interest is

high aspect ratio (AR 2 height/diameter 2 1.0) liquid bridges of high Prandtl number

ﬂuids (Pr = 67 and 207) suspended between coaxial disks heated differentially. The

unsteady ﬂow ﬁeld and associated RSs were revealed With the three—dimensional

particle tracking velocimetry. It is found that the ﬂow ﬁeld after the onset of instability

eXhibits oscillations With azimuthal mode number m = 1 and associated RSs traveling

in the axial direction. The RSs travel in the same direction as the surface ﬂow (CO—ﬂow

direction) for 1.00 3 AR 3 1.25 While they travel in the opposite direction (counter—

ﬂow direction) for AR 2 1.50, thus showing the Change of traveling directions With

AR. This traveling direction for AR 2 1.50 is reversed to the CO—ﬂow direction When

the temperature difference between the disks is increased to the condition far beyond

the critical one. This Change of traveling directions is accompanied by the increase

of the oscillation frequency. The Characteristics of the RSs for AR 2 1.50, such as

the azimuthal mode of oscillation, the dimensionless oscillation frequency, and the

traveling direction, are in reasonable agreement With those of the previous sounding

rocket experiment for AR 2 2.50 and those of the linear stability analysis of an inﬁnite

liquid bridge. ((3 2015 AIP Publishing LLC. [http://dX.d0i.0rg/10. 1063/1 .4908042]
I. INTRODUCTION

The instability of Marangoni convection due to the temperature gradient along the liquid—gas

interface has been studied extensively since Smith and Davis1 found by using the linear stability
analysis (LSA, hereafter) the hydrothermal wave (HTW, hereafter) in a liquid layer of Pr = 103—103,
where Pr is the Prandtl number of the ﬂuid. Their approach was used by Xu and DaVis2 for the insta—
bility of Marangoni convection in a liquid bridge (LB, hereafter) of inﬁnite length of Pr = 0.02—500.
They assumed a surface ﬂow from the heated side toward the cooled side and a return ﬂow in the oppo—
site direction. They obtained neutral stability curves of m = 0 and 1, Where m denotes the azimuthal
wave number of HTW that travels along the free surface of LB. The traveling direction for m = 1 is the
same With the surface ﬂow (CO—ﬂow direction, hereafter) While that for m = 0 is opposite (counter—ﬂow
direction, hereafter). They found that the critical mode of m = 1 is preferred for Pr < 62.2 while that

of m = 0 is preferred for higher Pr and also that this Pr—dependence is affected by the rate of heat
transfer from the liquid surface to the surrounding gas. The critical mode m = 0 in the ﬁnite LBs of
Pr = 105 with deformed free surface was shown numerically by Shevtsova and Legros3 for AR 2 2 / 3
and shown experimentally by Shevtsova er al.4 for AR 2 0.6, where the LB length, H , is normalized
by its diameter, D, thus deﬁning the aspect ratio, AR 2 H / D (Fig. 1). Afterwards, Shevtsova er al.5
found the mode m = 0 in the ﬁnite LBs of Pr = 14.3 and AR 2 0.9 with non—deformed free surface.
Recently, the instability in inﬁnite LB was revisited by Ryzhkov.6 His LSA revealed the presence of
two different neutral stability curves of m = 1(a) and m = 1(b); the HTW for the former travels in
the co—ﬂow direction as that for m = 1 of Xu and DaVis while the HTW for the latter travels in the
counter—ﬂow direction. Ryzhkov showed that the critical mode of m = 1(a) is preferred for Pr < 19.95
while that of m = 1(b) is preferred for higher Pr, concluding therefore that the critical mode of m = 0
found by Xu and Davis is not the most dangerous branch for any Pr in the inﬁnite LB.

The comparison of the LSA mentioned above with experimental data has been diﬂicult because
the length of the LB formed in experiment is limited. Figure 1 illustrates the experimental geometry
of the LB that is suspended between the heated disk and the cooled disk. Although the experimental
maximum AR is R(z3. 14) as predicted by the Rayleigh instability for the liquid column, much smaller
AR (say, AR < 1.0) is common in the previous experiments because the considerable LB deforma—
tion is unavoidable due to the hydrostatic pressure in the normal gravity. Recently, this limitation
is Challenged by Schwabe7’8 in his sounding rocket experiment, in which a LB of 2 CSt silicone oil
(Pr = 28) is formed in microgravity (pig, hereafter). The length of the LB is 15 mm and the disk
diameter is 6 mm, thus realizing a LB with AR 2 2.50 of non—deformed cylindrical shape. In this
unprecedentedly long LB, he observed the HTWs that travel in the counter—ﬂow direction. However,
he also observed the drifting Bénard—Marangoni cells that travel in the co—ﬂow direction. These two
ﬂow patterns appear simultaneously but travel in opposing directions to each other. The appearance of
such complicated ﬂow patterns may be due to (1) a large heat loss from the LB to the surrounding gas
in his experiment and (2) the fact that Pr = 28 is Close to Pr = 19.95 at which the Change of critical
branch from m = 1(a) to m = 1(b) is predicted by Ryzhkov.6

This paper is to report experimental data that can be compared with the previous LSA and the pi g
experiment. The data have been obtained from a series of space experiments}10 called Marangoni
Experiment in Space (MEIS), conducted on the International Space Station (188). The Fluid Physics
Experiment Facility (FPEF) designed for investigating the instability of Marangoni convection in long
LBs was used. Unlike the sounding rocket experiment whose duration is less than about 10 min, the
space experiment on 188 permits sufﬁciently long duration for each measurement, typically several
hours. This advantage has been exploited in the present experiments, where two silicone oils of 5 CSt
(Pr = 67) and 20 CSt (Pr = 207) were used to generate LBs of D = 30 mm and 50 mm. A wide range
of AR was experimented, i.e., 0.15 3 AR 3 2.08, but the present paper focuses mainly on the large
aspect ratios (AR 2 1.00). Note that Shevtsova er a1.“ recently conducted LSA to compare with the
space experiment for Pr = 67 and D = 30 mm. They reported that the critical temperature differences

"
"3","024108-3 Yano etal. Phys. Fluids 27, 024108 (2015)
for the onset of instability show favorable agreement for large AR (i.e., AR 2 1.50) but they did not
report ﬂow structures or associated HTWs.

The behaViors of ﬂow structures and HTWs at much higher AT than ATC (i.e., AT > 2ATC) in the
space experiments were reported previously,9’10’12’13 Where AT is the temperature difference between
the heated disk and the cooled disk and ATC is the critical value for the onset of instability. Those
previous reports indicated the presence of the HTWs that travel in the co—ﬂow direction at moderately
high AT9’10’12 and start to eXhibit Chaotic features at much higher AT.13 Furthermore, Yano er al.12
examined the behaVior of the vortical structure (VS) in the LB and pointed out the appearance of the
multi—roll structure for AR 2 1.25 by noting their resemblance With those reported by Chernatinsky
er al.14 Yano er al. also reported that the VSs travel synchronously With the HTWs in the co—ﬂow direc—
tion at AT z 4ATC. The multi—roll structure consists of more than two convection rolls With the same
sense of rotation. Such a ﬂow structure is often recognized in liquid layers15‘17 and is observed only
in LBs of large AR.12’18 The traveling of the convection rolls along the aXial direction of LBs after the
onset of instability was studied by Chernatinsky er al.,14 Schwabe,7’8 and Yano er al.13 The convection
rolls are called “roll” by Chernatinsky er al., “drifting Benard—Marangoni cells” by Schwabe, and
“vortical structures” by Yano er al. Those differently called structures appear to be the same and they
are called “roll structures (RSs)” in this paper. The traveling direction of RSs is co—ﬂow direction in
the experiments by Schwabe and Yano er al., While it is counter—ﬂow direction in the numerical result
by Chernatinsky er al. On the other hand, Shevtsova er al.19 found in their numerical study that the
propagating direction of aXisyrnmetric waves for AR 3 1 and Pr = 68 at a supercritical condition is
co—ﬂow direction Where the LES are cooled by the ambient gas ﬂow.

The present paper is to report the behaViors of the RSs and HTWs for large AR at conditions near
the onset of instability to provide thus a transition scenario that is consistent With the previous LSA
and the experiments on the LES of high Pr ﬂuids.

II. METHODS

All the experiments have been conducted in the FPEF on ISS.9’10 It can accommodate either a
30 rnm—diarneter disk apparatus or a 50 rnm—diarneter disk apparatus for LB formation. The LB is
formed between the heated sapphire disk and the cooled aluminum disk. The maximum LB length is
62.5 mm for both apparatuses, giving the maximum AR of 2.08 and 1.25 for 30 mm and 50 mm disks,
respectively. Note that 2.08 is Close to the theoretically achievable maximum value (i.e., AR 2 Tl?)
from the Rayleigh limit and only the sounding rocket experiment by Schwabe7’8 realized a larger
AR(= 2.50) in the past. To hold long LBs stably in the present ug experiments (typically, several hours
for each experiment), a slightly concave LB shape is Chosen, resulting in the volume ratio VR(=V/ V0)
to be 0.95 Where V and V0 are deﬁned in Fig. 1. Both disks are precisely temperature controlled to
keep AT to suppress time variations less than :01 OC. The LB formation apparatus is ﬁlled With argon
gas at 94 kPa and room temperature (20—23 0C).

As a high Pr ﬂuid, silicone oil manufactured by Shin—Etsu Chemical Co., Ltd.20 is used. Two
different kinematic Viscosities, i.e., 5 and 20 CSt, are Chosen. Their Pr numbers are 67 and 207, respec—
tively. Typical physical properties of the silicone oils at 25 0C are summarized in Table I. When neces—
sary, the temperature dependence of kinematic Viscosity, v, is evaluated from the following relation
in the manufacturer’s data sheets:

25 — T
V(T)—eXp (5.892X 273.15+T)XV(25)’ (1)
where T is in OC. As shown later, a representative value for the kinematic Viscosity is evaluated as
17 = (V(TH) + V(TC)) / 2, Where TH and TC are the temperatures of the heated disk and the cooled disk,
respectively. Note that the present 5 CSt silicone oil contains the photochromic dye21 at 0.01 %—0.05%
by weight. It is assumed that this quantity does not affect the physical properties of the ﬂuid except
for the temperature coeﬂicient of surface tension, 07*, Which is therefore measured in advance.

A schematic diagram of the measurement apparatuses is shown in Fig. 2. Three ﬁnger—sized B/W
CCD cameras for 3—D ﬂow Visualization are mounted near the transparent heated disk. A color CCD
camera and an infrared (IR) camera are used to observe the LB shape and the surface temperature

distribution, respectively. The temperature resolution of the IR camera is 10.2 0C. All images from
the cameras are digitized to 720 X 480 pixel frames at 30 frames/s. For disk temperature measure—
ment, two indium—tin oxide (ITO) ﬁlm sensors are used for the heated disk and three thermocouple
sensors are embedded ﬂush to the surface of the cooled disk. Their temperature signals are sampled
at 10 Hz to determine oscillation frequencies Which are well higher than 0.1 Hz under the present
conditions. The oscillation frequencies are also determined by the 3—D ﬂow Visualization and by the
photochromic dye activation technique.9’10’12 It is ensured that all these techniques provide consistent
measurements of oscillation frequencies. More details about the present experimental facility and
measurement apparatuses can be found in Refs. 9 and 10.

As shown later, the ATC can be less than 5 0C in some cases of the present experiment, Where
the temperature resolution of the IR camera is not suﬂicient to resolve surface temperature oscilla—
tion. T0 reveal oscillatory convection in the LB, three—dimensional particle tracking velocimetry (3—D
PTV)22 installed in FPEF is exploited. This technique was successfully used to quantify oscillatory
convection as well as steady convection in 5 CSt silicone oil LBs formed in FPEF.12 The working
ﬂuid is seeded With metal coated acrylic tracer particles having an average diameter of 180 ,um and
an average density of 1300 kg/m3. The three B/W CCD cameras are used to capture time series of
particle images for 3—D PTV. Modiﬁed particle tracking algorithm is developed here so that it can
handle some cases Where the ﬂuid is rather densely seeded.

while F increases monotonously With AR for 0.15 3 AR 3 0.7. It is interesting to note that there are
two branches in F and all the data considered here fall onto either of these two branches. The present
Mac exhibits local maxima at AR z 0.9 for Pr = 67 and 207 and at AR z 1.25 for Pr = 67. At this
latter AR, the present F for Pr = 67 exhibits a Change of critical branch Where F = 2.23 at AR 2 1.25
decreases sharply to F = 1.12 at AR 2 1.50. For AR 2 1.50, both Mac and F increase monotonously
With AR, and the present trend is in accord With the results of Schwabe at AR 2 2.50. The results
shown above indicate the presence of a Change of critical branch for long LB at AR = 1.25—1.50. This
Change of critical branch is Characterized by the sharp decrease of Mac and F . In What follows, the
branches for small AR and large AR are referred to as “branch A” and “branch B”, respectively.

The basic ﬂow patterns measured at Ma that is slightly lower than Mac are presented in Fig. 4.
The experimental conditions are listed in Table II, Where D = 30 mm, Pr = 67, and TC is kept con—
stant at 20.0 °C and TH 2 TC + AT. The particle trajectories are plotted on a half aXisymmetric plane
(i.e., r / z—plane), Where the steady aXisymmetry 0f the ﬂow ﬁeld for Ma < Mac is used to project

a single—RS for AR = 0.50 and 0.75. Not shown here, tWO—RS are also observed in LBs of AR = 1.75
and 2.00. The appearance of similar multi—RS was also reported by Schwabe and Velten18 in their
steady Marangoni convection in LB of AR = 2.05. It can be said that the instability 0n branch B
appears in long LBs which eXhibit tWO—RS (0r multi—RS) in the basic ﬂow.
Figure 5 shows a time series of oscillatory ﬂow structures and associated surface temperature for
Pr = 207 and AR = 1.25 (D = 50 mm) at Ma = 1.35Mac. This condition corresponds to a slightly
supercritical one Close to branch A as indicated by the ﬁlled triangles in Figs. 3(a) and 3(b). The exper—
imental condition and the observed oscillation Characteristics are given in Table III. The ﬂow structure
and surface temperature eXhibit a baCk—and—forth oscillation in a ﬁxed radial direction, forming a
standing wave (SW, hereafter) of m = 1 with a period of 109.2 s (F = 2.21). The relation between
the oscillation direction and the Viewing direction of the IR camera is depicted in Fig. 5(b), Where

x direction is perpendicular to the Viewing direction of the IR camera in this experiment. Only the
particle trajectories located in the region deﬁned With a dashed line are plotted onto an r / z—plane in
Fig. 5(a), Which also includes the surface temperature deviation and its laterally averaged dimension—
less proﬁle. Note that the phase superposition and the phase averaging over 13 oscillation periods
are applied to the particle traj ectories and the surface temperature deviation, respectively. The ﬂow
structures and the surface temperature deviations presented in Fig. 5(a) indicate the synchronous
travel of RS and HTW in the direction from the heated disk toward the cooled disk. Here, the location
of RS is marked With the arrows in each plot. It is also indicated that the lower temperature region
that is recognized as a dark band in the surface temperature deviation is always located near the tip
of RS. Ryzhkov and Shevtsova26 reported from their LSA of an inﬁnite LB that the HTWs due to
perturbations are in Close relation With the RSs due to superposition of perturbations and the basic
ﬂow. Their result seems to support the synchronous motion of HTWs and RSs shown in Fig. 5.
Figure 6 shows the ﬂow ﬁeld for Pr = 67 and AR 2 1.25 (D = 30 mm) at Ma 2 1.21Mac (AT
2 6.5 0C). This condition is also Close to branch A. Since the temperature resolution of the present
IR camera is not suﬁicient to capture surface temperature oscillations for this condition as mentioned
in Sec. 11, only the particle trajectories are shown here. The oscillation mode of the ﬂow ﬁeld is SW
(m = 1) With a period of 45 .5 s. The oscillation of particle trajectories in the r / z plane is seen in
Fig. 6, in which the presence of RSs and their traveling in the co—ﬂow direction are obvious. On the
left side of the LB, a new RS appears in the corner near the heated disk at t = 0—1 / 6 f , it travels With
growing in size for t = 1 / 6 f —3 / 6 f , it then occupies the entire left side for t = 3 / 6 f —5 / 6 f , it shrinks
With approaching the cooled disk for t = 5 / 6 f —8 / 6 f , and it ﬁnally disappears at the cooled disk at
t = 8 / 6 f—9 / 6 f . The same evolution of RS With the same period offset by a half period is seen on
the right side of LB. There are phases in Which two RSs eXist simultaneously on the same side of the

LB, forming the multi—RS. It can be said from Figs. 5 and 6 that the RS and the HTW for AR 2 1.25
under the instability condition Close to branch A travel in the CO—ﬂow direction. Not shown here, the
traveling of RSS in the CO—ﬂow direction is also observed at the critical condition for AR 2 1.00 and
Pr = 207.

The ﬂow structures observed under the condition very Close to branch B are shown in Fig. 7,
Where Pr = 67, AR 2 1.50 (D = 30 mm), and Ma 2 1.02Mac (AT 2 3.1 0C) as listed in Table III.
TWO—RSs similar to those in Fig. 6 are observed. However, the RSs travel in the counter—ﬂow direc—
tion. Not shown here, the RSs observed for AR 2 1.75 and 2.00 Close to branch B also travel in the
counter—ﬂow direction. It is, therefore, evident that the Change of critical branch that is Characterized
by the jumps of Mac and F in Fig. 3 is accompanied by the Change of the traveling direction of
RSs. Although the HTWs are not Visualized directly for AR 2 1.50 near the critical branch, they are
considered to be traveling synchronously With the RSs in the counter—ﬂow direction. Our previous
studiesg’lo’12 for Pr = 67 and D = 30 mm reported the traveling 0f HTWs in the CO—ﬂow direction
under the two conditions: (AR,Ma/Mac) = (150,402) and (2.00, 6.59). Note that the HTWs are
well resolved With the IR camera at these high Ma conditions. These results are included in Fig. 3
to indicate that their dimensionless oscillation frequencies lie on the extended curve of branch A.
The particle trajectories for AR 2 1.50 and Ma 2 4.02Mac are shown in Fig. 8, Where the presently
modiﬁed particle tracking technique is applied to improve the previous result.12 The comparison of
Fig. 8 With Fig. 7 demonstrates that similar two—RSs are present but their traveling direction is opposite
(i.e., in the CO—ﬂow direction in Fig. 8 vs. in the counter—ﬂow direction in Fig. 7).

C. Comparison with the literature data

The present results for AR 2 1.50 are compared With the previous studies reported by Xu and
Davis,2 Schwabe,7’8 and Ryzhkov6 in terms of the critical Marangoni number, the oscillation fre—
quency, the oscillation mode, and the traveling direction of RS/HTW. Xu and Davis as well as Ryzhkov
assumed a constant temperature gradient along the free surface of the inﬁnite LB. They deﬁned the
following Marangoni number, Ma*:

The results are summarized in Table IV. Note that the mode m = 0 reported by Xu and DaVis is
not included here because all the present experimental results indicate m = 1. It is pointed out that
the cooling/heating from the free surface strongly affects the instability of Marangoni convection.27’28
The effect is, therefore, evaluated in terms of the Biot number, Bi,8 deﬁned as follows:
. 61R
Bl = —_ gas , (6)
k (T — Tgas)
Where k is the thermal conductivity of the ﬂuid, q the heat ﬂux from the liquid surface to the surround—
ing gas, Rgas the thickness of the surrounding gas, T the mean temperature of the working ﬂuid
(=(TH + TC) / 2), and Tgas the temperature of the surrounding gas. Since the direct measurement of q for
the present experiments is diﬂicult, it is estimated numerically using commercial CFD software as re—
ported by Tiwari and Nishino,29 Who considered only the convective heat transfer. A two—dimensional
computational domain 45 mm (Rgas = 30 mm) in radius and 80 mm + H in height is considered, and
the LB is placed in the center of the domain. Steady, laminar ﬂows are assumed both in the LB and in
the surrounding gas. The estimated values of Bi are included in Table IV. As expected, they are not
large in magnitude for the present cases near branch B, i.e., |Bi| g 0.21. For this reason, the results
of LSA for Bi 2 0 are compared here. On the other hand, Bi 2 3.5 is reported by Schwabe8 for his
ug experiment. This considerably high Bi should be due to that D = 6 mm of 2 cSt silicone oil LB in
his experiment, thus producing a stronger convection than presently. As for Bi for LBs, Gaponenko
and Shevtsova30 reported Bi* 2 0.5 for AR 2 0.5 under microgravity condition, where their deﬁnition
of Bi* is based on the LB radius rather than Rgas used here. According to their deﬁnition, the present
|Bi| S 0.21 would be |Bi*| g 0.11. This appreciably smaller value than 0.5 is due to the fact that only
large AR (i.e., AR 2 1.5) is considered here. It is known that the average heat transfer coeﬂicients over
a ﬂat plate for laminar forced convection and laminar natural convection decrease With the length of

the plate, and a similar trend is expected for LBs. Actually, the Bi* for AR 2 0.5 evaluated for the
present condition is Bi* 2 0.42, Which is Close to the value reported by Gaponenko and Shevtsova.
The present results for AR 2 1.50, 1.75, and 2.00 at Ma z Mac give (Ma*,F*) = (279,1.10),
(294, 1.13), and (260, 1.10), respectively. Their instability is on branch B, thus the RSs travel in the
counter—ﬂow direction. These Characteristics are in agreement With those on branch m = 1(b) found
by Ryzhkov6 WhO reported Ma* 2 253, F * = 0.78, and the traveling of waves in the counter—ﬂow
direction. This agreement suggests that the present instability mode on branch B is corresponding
to that on branch m = 1(b) found by Ryzhkov. The HTW instability reported by Schwabe7’8 gives
(Ma*, F *) = (230, 1.00) for HTWs traveling in the counter—ﬂow direction, Whereas another instability
accompanied by drifting Bénard—Marangoni cells is observed in his experiment. The Characteristics
of the HTW are in agreement With those for branch m = 1(b) for Pr = 28 0f Ryzhkov. The agree—
ment mentioned here suggests that the end effect of LB in experiments accompanied by the steep
temperature gradients near the heated disk and the cooled disk might become substantially weak or
localized for long LB (say, AR 2 1.50) so that the overall instability mode observed there approach
to that for inﬁnitely long LB. This is in accord With the study by Kawamura er al.31 WhO reported the
presence of the end effect and its localization in the instability mode of thin liquid layers of high Pr.
It is important to note that the oscillation mode observed in the previous pig experiment7’8 and LSAZ’6
was rotating wave (RW, hereafter) While it is SW in the present results. According to Kuhlmann and
Rath,32 and Leypoldt er al.,33 the appearance of either SW 0r RW is determined by the amplitudes of
the Clockwise and the counter—Clockwise traveling HTWs, and SW appears When the amplitudes of
the two HTWs are equal While RW appears in other cases. The oscillation frequencies for SW and
RW are therefore equal at the onset of instability.32
On the other hand, the present results at Ma* 2 1031 and 1004, Which corresponds to Ma
2 4.02Mac and 4.61Mac, give F * = 3 .20 and 3.95, respectively, for the traveling of RSS and HTWs in

"
"12","024108-12 Yano el‘ al. Phys. Fluids 27, 024108 (2015)
the co—ﬂow direction. These Characteristics under the signiﬁcantly supercritical conditions are Close
to those for m = 1 of Xu and Davis2 and for m = 1(a) of Ryzhkov.6 It is interesting to point out that
the oscillation period of drifting Benard—Marangoni cells found by Schwabe7’8 takes approximately
2.5 s, giving F z 5.5 (F * z 3.49), and lies on the extended curve of branch A in Fig. 3(b). The cells
travel in the co—ﬂow direction as in the case for the present RS/HTW for higher Ma* and as well as
the HTW for m = 1 of Xu and Davis (or m = 1(a) of Ryzhkov). As for F *, both experiments agree
reasonably With each other While Xu and DaVis for Pr = 28 and D = 6 mm give a smaller value (i.e.,
F * = 1.73). As conjectured by Ryzhkov, this difference might be due to the end—wall effect that is
unavoidably present in experimentation of the ﬁnite LB suspended between the disks. Schwabe7’8
reported the simultaneous appearance of the HTWs traveling in the counter—ﬂow direction and the
Benard—Marangoni cells traveling in the opposite direction Whereas the present experimental results
indicate the traveling of both HTWs and RSs in the same direction. It is conjectured that the pres—
ence of the opposing traveling directions found by Schwabe reﬂects that the two instability modes of
m = 1(a) and m = 1(b) appeared simultaneously.
IV. CONCLUSIONS
This paper reports the experimental results on the instability and associated RSs of Marangoni
convection in liquid bridges of high Prandtl number ﬂuids (Pr = 67 and 207) With large aspect ra—
tio (AR 2 height/diameter) formed under the microgravity environment on the International Space
Station. The ﬂow ﬁeld under the steady state condition (i.e., Ma < Mac) indicates the presence of
the stationary multi—RSs for AR 2 1.25. After the transition to the oscillatory state, the ﬂow ﬁeld
starts to eXhibit the RSs that travel in the same direction as the surface ﬂow (co—ﬂow direction) for
1.00 3 AR 3 1.25 While to travel in the opposite direction (counter—ﬂow direction) for AR 2 1.50,
thus indicating the Change of the mode With AR (i.e., the change from “branch A” for AR 3 1.25 to
“branch B” for AR 2 1.50). The traveling in the counter—ﬂow direction on branch B is reversed at
the condition far beyond the critical one (say, Ma > 4Mac), Where the RSs are shown to travel in the
co—ﬂow direction synchronously With the HTWs. This Change of traveling directions is accompanied
by the increase of oscillation frequency. The oscillation Characteristics on branch B observed in the
present data, such as the onset condition of oscillation, the oscillation mode, the dimensionless oscil—
lation frequency, and the traveling direction, are reasonable agreement With those of the sounding
rocket experiment for AR 2 2.50 reported by Schwabe7’8 and those of the linear stability analysis of
an inﬁnite liquid bridge reported by Ryzhkov,6 suggesting that the instability mode on branch B found
for AR 2 1.50 is corresponding to that of m = 1(b) found by Ryzhkov.
