exercise were 0.72 BW during single—leg heel raises and 0.68 BW during double—leg squats. Forces
during CEVIS exercise were small, approaching only 0.19 BW at 210 W and 95 RPM. We conclude that
the three exercise devices studied were not able to elicit loads comparable to exercise on Earth, with the
exception of CEVIS at its maximal setting. The decrements were, on average, 77% for walking, 75% for
running, and 65% for squats when each device was at its maximum setting. Future developments must
include an improved harness to apply higher gravity replacement loads during locomotor exercise and
the provision of greater resistance exercise capability. The present data set provides a benchmark that
will enable future researchers to judge whether or not the new generation of exercise countermeasures
recently added to the ISS will address the need for greater loading.
