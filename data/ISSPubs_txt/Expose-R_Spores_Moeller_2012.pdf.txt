Spores of wild-type and mutant Bacillus subtilis strains lacking various structural components were exposed to simulated Mar-
tian atmospheric and UV irradiation conditions. Spore survival and mutagenesis were strongly dependent on the functionality
of all of the structural components, with small acid-soluble spore proteins, coat layers, and dipicolinic acid as key protectants. U
