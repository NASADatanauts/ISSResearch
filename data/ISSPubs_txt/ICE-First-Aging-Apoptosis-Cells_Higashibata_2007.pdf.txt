E Abstract
8- The ﬁrst International Caenorhabditis elegans Experiment (ICE-First) was carried out using a
_‘ Russian Soyuz spacecraft from April 19-30, 2004. This experiment was a part of the program of the
“Z, DELTA (Dutch Expedition for Life science Technology and Atmospheric research) mission, and the
a space agencies that participate in the International Space Station (188) program formed international
(cg research teams. A Japanese research team that conducted by Japan aerospace Exploration Agency
%. (JAXA) investigated the following aspects of the organism: (1) whether meiotic chromosomal
H‘ dynamics and apoptosis in the germ cells were normal under microgravity conditions, (2) the effect
of the space ﬂight on muscle cell development, and (3) the effect of the space ﬂight on protein
aggregation. In this article, we summarize the results of these biochemical and molecular biological
analyses.
2 Introduction
If The nematode Caenorhabditis elegans is a model organism for the study of most biological
""U functions involved in development and differentiation. Further, it is advantageous for space-
: ﬂight experiments due to its compact body size and easy handling.
C
'5: The ﬁrst International C . elegans Experiment (ICE-First) involved an international cooperative
91 research between Canadian Space Agency (C SA), Centre National d’Etudes Spatiales (CNES),
Z European Space Agency (ESA), National Aeronautics and Space Administrations (NASA),
% Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency (JAXA), and the Space Research Organization of the
3 Netherlands (SRON). This ﬂight experiment was a part of the program of the Dutch Expedition
2. for Life science, Technology, and Atmospheric research (DELTA) and was carried out using
'2 a Russian Soyuz spacecraft from April 19-30, 2004. The research teams Ofeach nation analyzed
several aspects of the space-ﬂown nematodes, such as gene expression, motility, apoptosis,
muscular atrophy, etc. In this article, we summarize the results of the biochemical and
molecular biological analyses that were carried out on the nematodes in Japan. The
experimental team comprised four research groups, namely, those of Dr. Ishioka (JAXA), Dr.
Higashitani (Tohoku University), Dr. Kagawa (Okayama University), and Dr. Honda (Tokyo
Metropolitan Institute of Gerontology). The mission was accomplished successfully, and
Z several results have already been published [1-4].

92 Experimental Objective of ICE-First
E In this cooperative experiment, we investigated the following aspects of C. elegans: (1) whether
'5: meiotic chromosomal dynamics and apoptosis in the germ cells were normal under
91 microgravity conditions, (2) the effect of the space ﬂight on muscle cell development, and (3)
“Z, the effect of the space ﬂight on sarcornere integrity and age-related protein aggregation.

(53 Flight Overview and Sample Preparation
%' The nematodes used in this experiment were prepared in Toulouse, France. After preparation,
H they were transported to Moscow. The ground control groups were kept in Moscow, and the
experimental ﬂight groups were transported to the launch site located at Baikonur, Kazakhstan.
The Soyuz spacecraft was launched 5 days after the preparation of the samples, and it was

docked 2 days after the launch. The ﬂight experimental groups were at the International Space
Station (ISS) for 10 days. The nernatodes were cultured in a chemically deﬁned liquid medium
(CeMM: C. elegans Maintenance Medium) in order to exclude the surface tension incident on

Z them [5]. The samples were maintained at 120C in KUBIK until the spacecraft docked at the

:F ISS. KUBIK is an incubator developed by ESA to perform biological experiments. In this

; experiment, two KUBIKs were uploaded: KUBIK Amber with an insert with a microgravity

> plate and a centrifuge, and KUBIK Topaz with only a microgravity plate. The uploaded worms

5 were cultured in KUBIKs throughout the experiment. After docking, the samples were exposed

g to a temperature of 200C. The samples were frozen in liquid nitrogen after the spacecraft was

"" landed.

Z

g During the ﬂight, the population size more than doubled for the space-ﬂown as well as the

(/2 ground control nernatodes. Statistical analysis revealed no signiﬁcant difference in the number

2, of the ground control and ﬂight groups of nematodes (p = 0.083). The total RNA and protein

2- oontent per nernatode were identical in the ﬂight and ground samples. These results
demonstrate that the two populations of nematodes developed equally well; no gross defects
in growth had occurred due to the space ﬂight.

Summary of apoptosis analyses

% During the development of C. elegans hermaphrodites, 131 of the 1090 somatic cells and

JD approxnnately 300 germ cells .undergo prograrnrned cell death as physiological apoptosis [6,

> 7]. In addition, DNA damage induced apoptos1s can occur at the meiotic paohytene nucleus

j> stage of the germ cells [8]. Checkpoint-induoed apoptosis is involved in maintaining genomic

g stability through the elimination of cells that have failed to repair DNA damage. However, the

2 occurrence of oheokpoint-induced and other types of physiological apoptosis in animals during

Z or as a result of space ﬂight has not been documented. In this experiment, we have analyzed

CD the occurrence of checkpoint-induced and other types of physiological apoptosis in germ cells

2 during space ﬂight by using a well-oharaoterized rnetazoan, the nematode C. elegans. Both

8 DNA damage oheckpoint-induced apoptosis and physiological apoptosis are mediated by the

%' core apoptotio machinery (CED-9, CED-4, and CED-3) and the engulfrnentrnachinery(CED-1

H‘ and CED-Z); however, the former apoptosis is differentially controlled by the checkpoint genes
(atl-I, mrt-2, rad—5, and him-7). Most of these C. elegans genes are highly conserved in
mammals [8,9]. Comparison of the number of cell corpses in wild-type or ced-1 rnutants, grown
under either ground or space ﬂight conditions, showed that both paohytene-oheckpoint-induced
apoptosis and physiological apoptosis in germ cells occurred normally under space ﬂight
conditions. In addition, apoptosis-related genes were expressed normally in the space-ﬂown

Z nernatodes. This is the ﬁrst report that documents the normal occurrence of several kinds of

E apoptosis, including oheokpoint-induced apoptosis, in the space environment. This ﬁnding

""'0 supports the hypothesis that humans would retain the ability to eliminate cells that have failed

> to repair cosmic radiation-induoed DNA lesions during space ﬂight. The details of these results

E have already been reported in another journal [1].

2 Summary of the molecular biological analyses of muscle development in the

9:, space-flown nematodes

:5

g The molecular mechanisms underlying muscle atrophy during space ﬂight are not well

2 understood. We analyzed the effects of a 10 day space ﬂight on muscle development in wild-

i type C. elegans (Bristol N2) using biochemical and molecular biological techniques such as
DNA microarray, real-time quantitative PCR, and quantitative western blot. The results of
these analyses revealed that the amount of myosin heavy chains (MHC) in both the body-wall

and pharyngeal muscles decreased in response to the space ﬂight. Furthermore, decreased
transcription of the body wall rnyogenic transcription factor HLH-l (CeMyOD) and the three
pharyngeal rnyogenic transcription factors PEB-l, CEH-22, and PHA-4 were also observed.

Z Following their return to Earth, microscopic observation of the nematodes revealed reduced
:F motility rates, indicating a functional defect. These results demonstrate that muscle
; development in C. elegans was altered in response to the space ﬂight. This altered development
> occurred at the level of gene transcription and was observed in the presence of innervation, not
5 simply in isolated cells. This important ﬁnding coupled with past reports of decreased
8- transcription levels of the same rnyogenic transcription factors in space-ﬂown vertebrates raises
_‘ the possibility that altered muscle development is a contributing factor to space ﬂight-induced
“Z, muscle atrophy in vertebrates. The details 0fthese results have already been reported in another
g journal [2].
2, On the other hand, the analyses of pararnyosin mutant unc-I5(e 73) nematodes showed results
2- that were different from those of the wild-type organisms. After the space ﬂight, atrophy of
the body-wall muscle and an increase in thick ﬁlament proteins were observed in the unc-15
nematodes. This result indicated that the mutant with abnormal muscles responded to
microgravity by increasing the total amount of muscle protein in order to compensate for the
loss of muscle function (manuscript in preparation).
2 Summary of the DNA microarray analysis
:.|: DNA microarray is a powerful technique to analyze the microgravity effect on gene
""U expressions. We compared the gene expression levels between the ground control worms and
> the space-ﬂown worrns. As shown in Table 1, the number of genes transcriptionally altered
E was listed up by gene ontology (GO) terms. In the space-ﬂown worrns, the up—regulated genes
'5: were dominant in the GOs related to embryonic and larval development, garnetogenesis, and
91 reproduction, and the down-regulated genes were dominant in the GOs related to locomotory
Z behavior, G-protein coupled receptor protein, and ion transport. my0-3, unc-5 4 , and hZh-I genes
% described in previous section are categorized as the down-regulated genes in “locomotory
5 behavior”. These results indicate that microgravity especially plays an important role of
g locomotory regulation, early ernbryO-genesis and the regeneration process in C. elegans.

Protein mapping of the space-flown worms
The alterations of entire protein expression of the space-ﬂown worms were analyzed by a
combination of two—dimensional gel electrophoresis. Over 1000 protein spots were detected
with SYPRO Ruby stain (Table 2, Fig. 1), and approximately 200 phosphoprotein spots were
detected with Pro—Q Diamond stain (Fig. 1). Approximately 10-15% spots signiﬁcantly
2 increased or decreased in the ﬂight samples compared with the ground control (Table 2).
I
""'0 In addition, several phosphoprotein spots drastically decreased in the ﬂight samples (Fig. 1,
> indicated in circles).
E
33-“ Summary of the effect of space flight on protein aggregation
T In order to examine the effect of space ﬂight on protein aggregation, we examined the change
9:) in the polyglutarnine (polyQ) aggregation in the transgenic C. elegans 0f (CAG)3 5 with yellow
a ﬂuorescent protein under muscle myosin heavy chain promoter. The space-ﬂown and ground
8 control nematodes were compared during the larval and young adult stages. The polyQ
%- aggregation in the space-ﬂown organisms was less than that in the ground control ones. These
"""" ﬁndings suggest that the protein aggregation rate of the space-ﬂown nematodes was slower
than that of the ground control ones (manuscript in preparation).

Concl usion
The ICE-First is one of the ﬁrst international collaboration that was performed at the
Z International Space Station using a genetic model species. A J apanese research team
:F participated in this program, and we concentrated on three investigations, narnely, apoptosis,
; muscle development, protein phosphorylation, and protein aggregation. The results of these
> investigations revealed irnportant evidence with regard to the effect of space ﬂight on the
E.- nernatode and validated that C. elegans is a valuable organism for space experiments. In
8' vertebrates, MyoD, a basic heliX-loop-heliX protein (bHLH), has been identiﬁed as a rnyogenie
"" factor playing a critical role in the determination and differentiation of skeletal muscle.
“Z, CeMyoD, which has been also identiﬁed as a body wall muscle speciﬁc transcription factor in
g C. elegans, is highly conserved in MyoD of vertebrates. Both of CeMyoD and MyoD has same
(I) function regulating MHC gene expression [10,11]. From this point, we suppose that C.
2, elegans is suitable to extrapolate one of the good answers against the muscle declination under
2- rnierogravity. As compared to other experimental species, this organism has advantages for
space experiments that include various lirnitations due to its compact size and easy handling
and also because abundant genetic information is available about this organism. The variety
of space experiments would increase if an automated experimental system were to be
developed.
This is a good opportunity for researchers who are interested in space life sciences;
Z opportunities for ﬂight experiments since the Columbia tragedy are few. We hope to continue
:F to execute such international cooperative experiments in the future.
