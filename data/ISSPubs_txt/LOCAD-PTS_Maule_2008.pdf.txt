Microorganisms within the space stations Salyut, Mir and the International Space Station
(ISS), have traditionally been monitored With culture-based techniques. These techniques
involve growing environmental samples (cabin water, air or surfaces) on agar-type media for
several days, followed by Visualization of resulting colonies; and return of samples to Earth
for ground-based analysis. This approach has provided a wealth of useful data and
enhanced our understanding of the microbial ecology Within space stations. However, the
approach is also limited by the following: i) More than 95% microorganisms in the
environment cannot grow on conventional growth media; ii) Signiﬁcant time lags occur
between onboard sampling and colony Visualization (3-5 days) and ground-based analysis (as
long as several months); iii) Colonies are often difﬁcult to Visualize due to condensation
Within contact slide media plates; and iv) Techniques involve growth of potentially harmful
microorganisms, Which must then be disposed of safely. This report describes the operation
of a new culture-independent technique onboard the ISS for rapid analysis (within minutes)
of endotoxin and [3-1, 3-glucan, found in the cell walls of gram-negative bacteria and fungi,
respectively. This technique involves analysis of environmental samples With the Limulus
Amebocyte Lysate (LAL) assay in a handheld device. This handheld device and sampling
system is known as the Lab-On-a-Chip Application Development Portable Test System
(LOCAD-PTS). A poster Will be presented that describes a comparative study between
LOCAD-PTS analysis and existing culture-based methods onboard the ISS; together With an
exploratory survey of surface endotoxin throughout the ISS. It is concluded that While a
general correlation between LOCAD-PTS and traditional culture-based methods should not
necessarily be expected, a combinatorial approach can be adopted Where both sets of data
are used together to generate a more complete story of the microbial ecology 0n the ISS.

"2","I. Introduction

The International Space Station (ISS) is an enclosed habitat, where crews of three to six astronauts live and work
for several months at a time. It was recognized early on in the history of the space program that microorganisms
might pose a health hazard to the crew if left unmonitoredl. Since the ﬁrst space ﬂight, by Yuri Gagarin in 1961,
microorganisms within spacecraft have traditionally been analyzed with culture-based techniques, both in the United
Statesz'5 and Russia6'13.

The current microbial requirements for the ISS are shown in Table 1 below. These requirements are currently
veriﬁed by the Crew Health Care System (CHeCS), an onboard kit consisting of various culture-based methods for
the analysis of air and water, as well as surfaces. Surfaces are analyzed with ‘Contact Slides’ (Biotest, Rocaway,
NJ), applied to a surface, incubated for 3-5 days, followed by Visualization of colonies. More sophisticated analyses
are performed on the ground following the return of ﬂight samples to NASA J ohnson Space Center.

Table 1. Current Microbial Requirements for Internal Surfaces 0f the International Space Station (ISS)
Requirements from 1ISS Mission Operations Requirements Document (MORD) section “7.4.4: In-ﬂight
environmental microbiology speciﬁcations and monitoring of air and surfaces” and “7.4.3 Preﬂight
Environmental Microbiology Speciﬁcations and Monitoring of Air and Surfaces”.

These culture-based techniques have provided extremely useful data regarding
the type and distribution of microorganisms in space stations, from Salyut13 t0 the i
1882. However, as with all techniques, there are several limitations; in this case, of
using a system to detect microorganisms based on their ability to grow on culture
media. Four of these limitations include: i) More than 95% microbial species
cannot be cultured in conventional growth media14'15; ii) Signiﬁcant time lags often
occur between onboard sampling and colony Visualization (3-5 days) and ground-
based analysis (as long as several months); iii) Colonies are often difﬁcult to
Visualize due to condensation within contact slide media plates (see Fig. 1); iV) - . .
Culture-based techniques involve growth of potentially harmful microorganisms,
which must then be disposed of safely. '

There are a variety of techniques used to detect microorganisms, each suitable
to a particular purpose. These techniques may test parameters such as a
microorganism’s ability to grow, metabolic activity, or the presence of
characteristic biological molecules. The Lab-On-a-Chip Application Development l
Portable Test System (LOCAD-PTS) detects the latter i.e., the presence of , ,
biolo ical molecules found in the cell walls of bacteria and fun i. These molecules Flgure 1' Condensatlon
. g _ . . .. . . . . g . within a ‘Contact Slide’
include. 1) Endotox1n, 11) [3-1, 3-glucan and 111) 11p0te1ch01c ac1d/pept1d0glyan.

. . . . . . . . . . onboard ISS

A common class1ﬁcat10n in microbiology is to d1V1de bacteria into two groups:
Gram-negative and Gram-positive. The ‘Gram’ refers to the Gram stain, developed
by Hans Christian Gram in 1884, to differentiate Klebsiella pneumoniae from pneumococcim. With this method,
Gram-negative bacteria stain pink and Gram-positive bacteria stain purple, and is related to structure of their cell
walls. EndotOXin - the bacterial form of which is also known as lipopolysaccharide (LPS) - is found predominantly
in the cell wall outer membrane of Gram-negative bacteria”, whereas lipoteichoic acid and peptidoglycan are found
in the cell walls of Gram-positive bacteria. The polysaccharide [3-1, 3-glucan is not found in either group of
bacteria, but only in the cell walls of fungi such as the baker’s yeast, Saccharomyces cerevisiae.

LOCAD-PTS detects endotoxin and [3-1, 3-glucan with the Limulus amebocyte lysate (LAL) assay. The LAL
assay is derived from early discoveries that microbial infection causes blood clots in the horseshoe crab Limulus
polyphemus18 and that the causative agent is endotoxin19'21. In 1977, the LAL assay replaced the rabbit pyrogen test
for endotoxin22 and in 1983, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) certiﬁed the LAL assay as a standard test for
endotoxins.

"3","The LAL assay is now used routinely to monitor endotoxin, as an important entity by itself and as a proxy for
Gram—negative bacteria, in a wide range of products and applications. These include: dairy products23, eye surgery
24, heart surgery25, dental surgery26, diagnosis of gram—negative peritonitis”, bioﬁlms in dialysis systems28, organs

While the LAL assay can be coupled to a UP°P°W9==h$LP$
turbidimetric reaction, this is time—consuming and labor— Factorc :> Activated Beta- 1.3 Glucan

The Endosafe PTS is a portable spectrophotometer Substrmpmm ananne 3 Wm"". mnne

the colorimetric LAL reaction takes place. Each LAL—
containing cartridge also contains p—nitroalanine, which Figure 2' Colorimetric LAL cascade
is converted into a yellow/green product if endotOXin is
present in the original sample.

The Endosafem PTS was then modiﬁed by the LOCAD Team at NASA Marshall Space Flight Center (MSFC)
t0 deem it ﬂight qualiﬁed, and ensure it could withstand the rigors of launch, and the space environment. The
instrument, along with a novel sample collection device, became known as the LOCAD—PTS. LOCAD—PTS
therefore consists of a modiﬁed Endosafem PTS, plus a surface sampling/processing kit that enables astronauts to
collect surface samples, dilute them with endotoxin—free water, mix, and then dispense as a liquid into a LOCAD—
PTS cartridge.

LOCAD—PTS was launched to the International Space Station (188) aboard Space Shuttle Discovery in
December 2006 and remains onboard the 188. This report describes preliminary results from eleven operations of
LOCAD—PTS onboard the 188 from March 2007 until the spring of 2008.

This report describes LOCAD—PTS operations performed on the 188 to address ﬁve main objectives: i)
Demonstrate correct instrument function in a mission environment (success criterion: mid/high reading for positive
control); ii) Demonstrate crew handling of LOCAD—PTS supplies without biological contamination e.g. from skin
(success criterion: <0.05EU/m1 reading for negative control); iii) Demonstrate consistent and reliable crew
operations of LOCAD—PTS in a mission environment; iV) Conduct general survey of surface endotOXin within Node
1 and the US Lab; and iV) Compare and contrast endotOXin data with colony forming unit (CFU) data obtained from
adj acent areas at each site.

III. Procedures
A. Crew Training
In general, crewmembers were trained in LOCAD-PTS operations approximately 12-18 months before launch.
In this experiment, procedures onboard 188 were performed by crewmember Sunita Williams, Peggy Whitson, Dan
Tani and Greg Chamitoff. Each received a 1-hour training session in the mock—up 188 US. Laboratory facility at
NASA Johnson Space Center (Houston, TX) several months preceding their mission. In addition, some
crewmembers attended a 2-day training session in molecular biology at the Marine Biological Lab (Woods Hole,
MA) during 2004, where they were familiarized with LOCAD-PTS. In the JSC training session, Williams was
trained to perform a complete end-to-end analysis of a surface swab with LOCAD-PTS, with special attention paid
to operation of the swabbing unit to perform mixing and dispensing operations.
B. Shipping and pre-launch
All LOCAD-PTS equipment was packaged by Teledyne Brown Engineering (TBE) at MSFC into a Half Cargo
Transfer Bag (CTB). The ‘Half’ refers to middeok locker equivalents (MLEs) i.e. a Half CTB will ﬁll half of a
Space Shuttle middeck locker. A Half—CTB has a 30 pounds maximum carrying capacity, with the dimensions of

transport and launch, major components (such as the two Readers) were separated by a solid foam material.
C. Launch and transfer to ISS

LOCAD-PTS was launched aboard Space Shuttle Discovery (STS-116) on December 9th 2006, which docked
with the ISS on December 12th 2006. Following docking, the half-CTB containing LOCAD-PTS was transferred
to the US Lab of the ISS, and stowed at ambient pressure (15 psi) and temperature (76°F) until use on March 31St
2007.

D. Overview of ISS Operations

Each operating session was deﬁned as either a ‘Phase 1’ session or
‘Phase 2’ session. Each Phase 1 session was performed according to the l
surface sampling layout in Fig. 8, with four surface swabs performed :33:
around two centrally placed media slides (for the culture-based detection of .‘//
fungi and bacteria). Each of these four swabs was analyzed with LOCAD- EEEER 1
PTS, so that data from LOCAD-PTS culture-based methods were obtained Egggg .-
for each site. The duration of a typical phase 1 session was approximately 3 Egggﬁ
hours. Each Phase 2 session consisted of ﬁve individual surface swabs 0f EWE
separate sites within the ISS; these sessions were slightly shorter than Phase
1 sessions, running approximately 2-3 hours. The selection of these sites H.
were sometimes guided by the LOCAD-PTS operations team, but often left $5553; 5“,
t0 crew discretion. These Phase 2 sessions constituted an exploratory
survey of surface endotoxin throughout the ISS.

A total of ﬁve Phase 1 sessions and ﬁve Phase 2 sessions were , ,

performed for LOCAD-PTS LAL analysis of surface endotoxin. Each Flgure 8' Surface sampllnglayout
Phase 1 session was performed by astronaut Suni Williams on March 31“,
April 30th, May 5th, May 8th and May 15th, 2007. The surface sites chosen for each of these ﬁve sessions are shown
in Fig. 9. Each of the Phase 2 LAL sessions were performed by astronauts Peggy Whitson and Dan Tani on
December 20th, 21St and 24th 2007 and February 2nd 2008. Phase 1 Glucan sessions began on June 21St 2008,
performed by astronaut Greg Chamitoff.

E. Swabbing

As can be seen from Fig. 8, each LOCAD-PTS swab covered a surface area of 250m2 (0r 2” X 2”), with all four
swabs surrounding two centrally placed contact slides (for the culture-based detection of bacteria and fungi) during
Phase 1. Swabs performed during Phase 2 similarly covered 250m2 (but contact media slides were not used in Phase
2). In this way, both culture-independent and culture-based methods were used together to analyze an approximate
10” X 10” area (i.e., the grey box in Fig. 8). The crew prepared to swab in this layout by placing four red post-it ﬂags
on the surface site (see red rectangles in Fig. 8); applying contact slides within those four post-it ﬂags; followed by
four swabs at the positions indicated. The swabbing protocol began with direct attachment of the water cartridge of
the swabbing kit via a push-and-turn action (while the knob 0f the swabbing unit was at position P). The water
cartridge was then attached to the swabbing tip by another push-and-turn action. At this point the swab unit was in

"
"7","the ‘swabbing conﬁguration’ i.e., a surface sample could be obtained by swabbing a surface with the swabbing tip
(see Fig. 10).
F. Mixing

Following swabbing, the dispensing tip was attached to the swab tip Via a push-on O-ring seal. This is called the
‘mixing/dispensing conﬁguration’ and at this point, mixing and dispensing took place. The knob on the swabbing
unit was manipulated up and down in notch W (see Fig. 5) ﬁve times at a rate of once per 2 seconds to mix the swab
sample with 1.2m1 0f endotoxin-free water in the water cartridge. Following mixing, the crew performed the
dispensing procedure (see below).

G. Dispensing

Following mixing, the knob 0f the swabbing unit was left in position 1. A further droplet was dispensed, and
then droplets were dispensed into an inserted LOCAD-PTS cartridge by cycling through notches 2-6. Moving the
knob down each of the subsequent notches (labeled 1-6) dispensed droplets of approximately 25m each. Fig. 11
shows Suni Williams dispensing a sample onboard the 188 during Phase 1 LAL operations.

IV. Discussion

This report describes the operation of a new type of biochemical microbial analysis performed aboard the
International Space Station (188) that builds upon the collective experience and excellent previous studies performed
in both the United States and Russia, from the early programs of Apollo4’5 and Salyut’13, to space station Mir’lo'lz, the
Shuttle-Mz'r program3 and most recently, the 1882’ 6'9.

It was the ﬁrst demonstration of complete biochemical analysis of environmental samples onboard a space
station from sampling to onboard data. While the analytical test performed was relatively simple - the Limulus
Amebocyte Lysate (LAL) assay for detection of endotoxin and [3-1, 3-glucar1 - the demonstration of the technology
and procedures serves as a foundation for future generations of more speciﬁc tests. The ease with which a variety of
crewmembers — pilots and scientists — performed procedures was especially important, given that a relatively high
level of hand-eye coordination and control was required, especially for the dispensing phase of operations. While
this procedure might be second nature to a biochemist, it may not so familiar to others, especially in a microgravity
environment; however, all crewmembers performed procedures equally well throughout each session.

A potential concern prior to this study was the absence of gloves from crew procedures, which could lead to
skin-derived biological contamination of the swab tip and false positive readings. The negative control was
designed to address this concern (where procedures were performed without a surface swab). N0 positive readings
were obtained during any of the three negative controls performed on orbit — indicating that procedures did not
introduce contamination to the swab tip (and that the reagents remained clean following extended storage on orbit).

"
"8","The waived requirement for gloves is a major advantage given the extra up—mass of clean gloves (and onboard
storage requirements), down—mass of used gloves, and greater crew time required for gloved operations. The robust
design of the cartridges, which enabled handling with bare hands, was a major beneﬁt to operations within the
distinctly non—steri1e ISS cabin environment.

While a general correlation should not be expected between data obtained with LOCAD—PTS and existing
culture—based methods, it is concluded that the two types of data should be used together to generate a more
complete story of microbial ecology on the 188. This approach — using a combination of culture—independent and
traditional methods, rather than one at the expense of another — has been implemented im many other areas from
hygiene monitoring on Earth35 to ﬁeld biology investigations of extreme environments on Earth, such as
Kamchatka36 and the Arctic”.
