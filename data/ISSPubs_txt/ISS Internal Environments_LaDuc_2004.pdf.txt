Molecular analyses were carried out on four preﬂight and six postﬂight International Space Station (188)-
associated potable water samples at various stages of puriﬁcation, storage, and transport, to ascertain
their associated microbial diversities and overall microbial burdens. Following DNA extraction, PCR
ampliﬁcation, and molecular cloning procedures, rDNA sequences closely related to pathogenic species
of Acidovorax, Aﬁpia, Brevundimonas, Propionibacterium, Serratia, and others were recovered in vary-
ing abundance. Retrieval of sequences arising from the iodine (biocide)-reducing Delftia acidovorans in
postﬂight waters is also of concern. Total microbial burdens of ISS potable waters were derived from data
generated by an ATP-based enumeration procedure, with results ranging from 0 to 4.9 X 10“ cells/ml.
Regardless of innate biases in sample collection and analysis, such circumstantial evidence for the pres-
ence of viable, intact pathogenic cells should not be taken lightly. Implementation of new cultivation
approaches and/or viability-based assays are requisite to conﬁrm such an occurrence.
