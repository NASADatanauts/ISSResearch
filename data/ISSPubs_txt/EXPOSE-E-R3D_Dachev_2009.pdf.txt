Abstract

The paper presents observation of relativistic electrons. Data are collected by the Radiation Risk Radiometer—Dosimeters (R3D)
B2/B3 modiﬁcations during the ﬂights of Foton M2/M3 satellites in 2005 and 2007 as well as by the R3DE instrument at the European
Technology Exposure Facility (EuTEF) 0n the Columbus External Payload Adaptor at the International Space Station (ISS) in the per—
iod February 20 — April 28, 2008. On the Foton M2/M3 satellites relativistic electrons are observed more frequently than on the ISS
because of higher (628"") inclination of the orbit. At both Foton satellites the usual duration of the observations are a few minutes long.
On the ISS the duration usually is about 1 min or less. The places of observations of high doses due to relativistic electrons are distributed
mainly at latitudes above 500 geographic latitude in both hemispheres 0n Foton M2/M3 satellites. A very high maximum is found in the
southern hemisphere at longitudinal range 0°—60°E. At the ISS the maximums are observed between 450 and 520 geographic latitude in
both hemispheres mainly at longitudes equatorward from the magnetic poles. The measured absolute maximums of dose rates generated
by relativistic electrons are found to be as follows: 304 nGy h‘1 behind 1.75 g cm—2 shielding at Foton M2, 2314 HGy h‘1 behind
0.71 g cm—2 shielding at Foton M3 and 19,195 nGy h‘1 (Flux is 8363 cm—2 s_l) behind les than 0.4 g cm—2 shielding at ISS.
