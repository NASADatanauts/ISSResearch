Abstract

Long—term analysis of data from two radiation detection instruments on the International Space Station (ISS) shows that the docking
0f the Space Shuttle drops down the measured dose rates in the region of the South Atlantic Anomaly (SAA) by a factor of 1.5—3. Mea—
surements either by the R3DE detector, Which is outside the ISS at the EuTEF facility on the Columbus module behind a shielding of less
than 0.45 g cnfz, and by the three detectors 0f the Liulin—5 particle telescope, Which is inside the Russian PEARS module in the spherical
tissue equivalent phantom behind much heavier shielding demonstrate that effect. Simultaneously the estimated averaged incident
energies of the incoming protons rise up from about 30 to 45 MeV. The effect is explained by the additional shielding against the
SAA 30—150 MeV protons, provided by the 78 tons Shuttle t0 the instruments inside and outside of the ISS. An additional reason is
the ISS attitude Change (performed for the Shuttle docking) leading to decreasing of dose rates in two of Liulin—S detectors because
of the East—West proton ﬂuxes asymmetry in SAA. The Galactic Cosmic Rays dose rates are practically not affected.

though they produce an enhancement in the dose rate,
the observed doses do not result in a dangerous increase —

The radiation ﬁeld at a location, either outside or inside
the spacecraft is affected both by the shielding and sur-
rounding materials (Badhwar et al., 1998; Shurshakov
et al., 1999; Benton and Benton, 2001; NCRP, 2002). Dose ,— .
