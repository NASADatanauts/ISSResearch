Abstract
Optimal nutrition will be critical for crew members who embark on space exploration missions. Nutritional assessment provides
an opportunity to ensure that crew members begin their missions in optimal nutritional status, to document Changes in status
during a mission, and to assess Changes after landing to facilitate return of the crew to their normal status as soon as possible
after landing. Nutritional assessment provides the basis for intervention, if it is necessary, to maintain optimal status throughout
the mission. We report here our nutritional assessment of the US astronauts who participated in the ﬁrst 12 International Space
Station missions.
