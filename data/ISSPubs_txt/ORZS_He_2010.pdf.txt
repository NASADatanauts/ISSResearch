Abstract
It is very important to recycle the inedible biomass of higher plants to improve the closure of bioregenerative life support system
(BLSS). Processing candidate higher plant residues into the soil—like substrate (SLS) as the plant growth medium is a promising way
to achieve. In this study, three different processing techniques of SLSs, using residues of wheat and rice as feedstock, were compared.
As for the ﬁrst traditional technique, SLSI was obtained by successive conversion of wheat straw by oyster mushrooms and worms.
In the other two methods, SLSs were produced with aerobic fermentation (SLS2) or anaerobic fermentation (SLS3) followed by worm
conversion. The changes in SLS cellulose, lignin, available elements and pH were measured during the production processes. The matu—
rity was evaluated by the value of C/N. The fertilities were compared in terms of available elements contents and lettuce productivities.
The results indicated that the second technique was optimal, whose process cycle was 30 days less than that of SLSI. The total cellulose
and lignin degradation of SLS2, achieved 98.6% and 93.1% during the 93—days—processing, and the lettuce productivity reached
12.0 g m‘2 day_l.
