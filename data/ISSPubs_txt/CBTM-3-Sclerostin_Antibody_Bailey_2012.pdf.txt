Figure 6. Histologic comparison of frozen and freshly processed rodent tail discs. Freezing results in subtle
differences in cell morphology observed at high magniﬁcation. Macroscopically, the previously frozen discs
(control specimen from STS-131; left) are comparable to those processed fresh (right; rat caudal disc). In
both cases the bone marrow spaces are maintained, and nucleus dehydration due to chemical processing for
parafﬁn embedding is evident. Although freezing results in subtle differences, no structural damage from ice
crystal formation is apparent.
