13 Abstract
14 A compact and reliable automatic method for plant nutrition supply is needed to monitor
15 and control space-based plant production systems. The authors have designed nutrient root
16 feeding system that allows minimizing and regulating nutrient and water supply Without loss of
17 crop yields in a space greenhouse. The system involves an ion-eXChange ﬁbrous artiﬁcial soil
18 (AS) BIONA-V3TM as a root-inhabited medium, a pack With slow release fertilizer as the main
19 source of nitrogen, phosphorus and potassium, and a cartridge With a granular mineral-rich ionite
20 (GMRI) as a source of calcium, magnesium, sulphur, and iron. The controller With electrical
21 conductivity meter controls the solution ﬂow and concentration in the mixing tank at speciﬁed
22 value. Experiments showed that the ﬁbrous AS stabilized pH of the substrate solution Within the
23 range of 6.0 to 6.6, favorable to the majority of crops. The experimental data conﬁrmed that this
24 technique allowed solution preparation for crops in space greenhouses by means of water
25 pumping through the cartridge, and minimization of the AS stock onboard the space vehicle.
26 1. Introduction
27 Expansion of human presence to lOW-Earth orbits, development of technologies for lunar
28 exploration, and space ﬂights to Mars and neighbouring asteroids all call for complementing the
29 life support systems (LSS) With biological subsystems that Will enhance autonomy and
30 biological adequacy of the crew environment (Gitelzon et.al., 2003, Berkovich et al., 2009).
31 Capability studies of space vehicles designed for remote space missions showed that in the
32 next decade the only component of LSS bio-subsystem could be a relatively small vegetable
33 or Vitamin production plant growth facility (PGF) as a source of natural Vitamins and
34 psychological support for the crew (Berkovich et.al., 2009). TWO PGFs developed at the
35 Russian State Scientific Center of the Institute of Biomedical Problems (IBMP), named

1

"
"4","1 “Svet” and “Lada”, have ﬂown in space; a new class of cylindrical conveyor-type PGF is

2 presented by several laboratory models that appear to be less demanding in terms of board

3 resources (primarily electric power and volume). Today, IBMP is engaged in testing a

4 prototype model of Vitamin PGF Vitaeycle-T designed for incorporation into the Russian

5 segment of the International Space Station.

6 All designs of Vitamin PGFs for different classes of space missions can be classiﬁed under

7 two categories depending on key service condition that is decisive for both the facility design

8 and crop cultivation technology including mineral nutrition supply:

9 1) gravity conditions (lunar and planetary bases);
10 2) microgravity conditions (orbital stations and exploration vehicles).
11 Gravity-speciﬁed PGFs are likely to implement some form of hydroponic technique
12 adapted to more rigid power constraints and volume limitations. In a large PGF water transpired
13 by the crop and then regenerated from air condensate Will have to be returned to the nutrient
14 solution preparation system. Thus, to provide adequate mineral nutrition to vegetables, at the
15 least solution pH and electrical conductivity must be automatically monitored and adjusted
16 (Domingues, 2012; Massa, 2011). Electrical conductivity is typically monitored using a
17 conductivity meter; pH is measured With the help of selective silver chloride electrodes. This
18 method produces satisfactory results, as Within the range of concentrations of salts suited for
19 crop nutrition solution, conductivity is essentially proportional to total salts concentration.
20 However, hydroponics microgravity application necessitates having no less than three
21 subsystems: to prepare and store mother solutions; to prepare fresh nutrient solutions; and to
22 monitor and adjust nutrient content at the root medium during plant growth. Consequently, the
23 facility Will have a cumbersome architecture With excessive equivalent system mass (Drysdale,
24 1999)
25 In the ISS greenhouse Lada minerals are provided to by granular clay TurfaceTM With slow-
26 acting fertilizer (SAF) Osmocote 14-14-14TM packed to root module (Bingham et a1., 2002). The
27 SAF amount is calibrated to provide sufﬁcient minerals for plant growth over planned
28 vegetation. Water pumped into the root module dissolves salts stored in SAF and then, owing to
29 osmotic pressure and diffusion, enriches the entire substrate volume. However, depending on
30 plants’ transpiration rate, soluble salts normally pass from SAF to substrate solution inside the
31 root module Within initial 10 to 15 days that is long before the end of lettuce vegetation period
32 (20-30 days). Therefore, plants may starve for minerals at the end of cultivation. While
33 increasing SAF dosage before sowing inevitably leads to exceeded concentrations of nitrate and
34 nitrite in plant biomass. Periodic introduction of new SAF doses before the next sowing is time-
35 consuming and endangers cabin air pollution.

"
"5","1 From our standpoint, a more convenient way to supply plants with mineral nutrients in
2 microgravity is to use a ﬁbrous ion-eXChange resin substrate (FIERS) loaded with plant nutrition
3 elements. Water potential control in the root zone can be adjusted by negative pressure
4 maintaining inside water-ﬁlled porous tubes immersed in the substrate (Berkovich et al., 2002,
5 Berkovich et al., 2003). FIERS is particularly good for microgravity as its capillary-porous
6 structure is unaffected by microgravity and does not pollute the cabin. The main disadvantage of
7 known FIERS is small mineral content per volume unit that dictates the necessity of relatively
8 large volumes of the store available onboard the space vehicle. For instance, to ensure the
9 speciﬁed annual Vitaeycle-T biomass production, the stock of FIERS BIONA-V3TM should
10 amount to 18 kg that will occupy about 150 dm3. The volume exceeding the PGF dimensions. T0
11 minimize the FIERS stock, we designed a mineral nutrition system with FIERS and enrichment
12 pack (column) with granular mineral-rich ionite mounted into the PGF water feeding system. If a
13 space greenhouse should grow plants during 2 - 3 months or longer, it will make sense to use a
14 SAF column as the main source of quickly consumed elements like nitrogen, potassium and
15 phosphorus (Berkovich et.al., 2013).
16 The aim of the effort was to test the new nutrient root feeding system integrated into a
17 conveyor—type PGF for leaf vegetables.
18
19 2. Methods
20
21 2.]. Mineral nutrition system
22 The functional diagram of the root feeding system is presented in ﬁg. 1. The system
23 consists of 10 root modules (RM) ﬁlled by FIERS BIONA-V3TM, an enrichment column with
24 GMRI BIOINA-312TM and an additional column with SAF Osmocote 14-14-14TM. The GMRI is
25 the main source of slowly-consumed elements (calcium, magnesium, sulphur, iron and
26 microelements); the SAF column is the key supplier of nitrogen, phosphorus and potassium
27 which are in particular demand for growing plants. Separate storage of the two types of nutrients
28 is of fundamental importance as their mineral gradients differ in both the way they dissolve and
29 the time course of their entry into the solution.
30 In the proposed system, water runs through the GMRI column into the mixing vessel with
31 a conductivity meter inside, and then into RMs. Upon receiving the signal of least acceptable
32 conductivity from the meter, the controller engages the pump that will keep on forcing water into
33 the bypass line and the mixing vessel Via the SAF column till conductivity in the mixing vessel
34 reaches a speciﬁed value.

"6","1 2.2. Calculation 0fthe mass and volume 0fthe enrichment column

2 Volumes of both enrichment columns and dry mass of nutritional substrates were

3 calculated on the assumption that:

4 1. mineral ﬂux is sufﬁcient to grow the desired crop;

5 2. certain time is needed for water to contact with substrate in the column;

6 3. in the output solution, each element must be present in at least its minimal acceptable

7 concentration.

8 Calculations were made using expressions:

9 M 2 (m Ci)/(ki-di); (1)
10 M = W/Vcrit; (2)
11 V = Tcont-w/ P. (3),
12 where M —mass of the column with nutritional substrate; m — expected plant biomass at the
13 end of speciﬁed time of PGF operation; Ci — weight content of the i-element in biomass; kz' —
14 weight content of the i-element in a unit of nutritional substrate mass; (11' —p0rti0n 0f the i-
15 element available to plants; W — total volume of water passing through the enriching column
16 during PGF operation; Vcrit — speciﬁc critical water volume equal to the volume that, when
17 running through one gram of substrate, produces output mineral concentrations no less than
18 minimal acceptable values; V — column volume; w — water ﬂow through the column; P —
19 nutritional substrate porosity; T cont — required time of water contact with the nutritional
20 substrate.
21 Reduction (due to wash-out) of mineral nutrients with the crop was calculated using the
22 (Domingues et a1., 2012) approach. Weight contents of nutrients in mass units of FIERS, GMRI
23 and SAF were taken from manufactures’ technical data. Total plant biomass was determined
24 based on the speciﬁcation for the PGF Vitaeycle-T, according to which this PGF must operate 72
25 days continuously with the average output of 60 g/day.
26 Time of contact between water and GMRI was determined as the time for establishing
27 nitrate-anion equilibrium concentration in the solution in the course of BIONA-312TM
28 moistening. It was assumed that, as a rough approximation, this time is the same for all other
29 elements. In this study, patches of dry GMRI with a mass of 3 grams were moistened with water,
30 covering the GMRI a layer of 1.0 mm to 1.5 mm thick, and exposed to 30 0C in a thermostat for
31 4 days in order to stabilize ion-eXChange resin granules. On the ﬁfth day, the resulted equilibrium
32 solution was removed and same volume of fresh water, heated to 30 0C, was added to the
33 sediment that was thereafter once again installed in the thermostat. During the next 4 hours the

4

"
"7","1 patches were one by one withdrawn from the thermostat for nitrate nitrogen measurement. The
2 test was repeated four times.
3 Speciﬁc critical volume of water that can be forced through the GMRI per mass unit was
4 determined by pumping water through a prototyped enrichment column with an average ﬂow
5 rate of 40 cm3/h in accordance with the requirement to contact time calculated using the
6 procedure described above. To imitate the column, a 500 ml separating funnel of glass was ﬁlled
7 with 220 g of GMRI BIONA-312TM and connected to a water tank raised above the funnel.
8 Output solution samples were collected daily to measure changes in pH, conductivity, and
9 chemical composition as a function of input water volume until concentration of a single element
10 reached 0.1 of initial concentration in standard Pryanishnikov’s solution (1976). Each test was
11 repeated twice.
12
13 2.3. pH dynamics
14 To monitor pH dynamics in pores of the FIERS BIONA-V3TM, patches were covered with
15 water with varying initial pH in a range imitating possible pH variation in irrigation water. Water
16 samples were prepared by adding sulfuric acid or caustic soda to potable water with 1:1 dry
17 FIERS/ water volume ratio. Fresh FIERS was used in the ﬁrst test, while FIERS cleaned of roots,
18 washed and dried after two consecutive crops of leaf cabbage, was used in the second. In both
19 instances, the FIERS patches were wrung out and pH was measured in resulting solutions after
20 1.5 and 48 hours. The tests were repeated three times.
21
22 2.4. Procedure ofvegetation experiments
23 The proposed system of mineral nutrient plant supply was further tested in two vegetation
24 experiments with Chinese cabbage Brassica chinensis L., cultivar Vesnianka. In one experiment,
25 the plants were raised in a laboratory model of conveyer-type cylindrical PGF Phytooyole-LED
26 (Erokhin et al., 2006) outﬁtted with red (650 nm) and blue (470 nm) light-emitting diodes that
27 provided ﬂux density no higher than 250 pmol/(mZ-s) (ﬁg. 2). The plant growth facility was
28 equipped with a unit of 10 RMs, each ﬁlled with 120 g of dry FIERS BIONA-V3TM (Berkovioh
29 et al., 2005). In the other experiment, plants grew under high-pressure sodium lamps located on
30 the laboratory stand described in (Berkovich et al., 2003). The root modules were designed as
31 tubes made of ﬁne-pore titanium tightly wrapped in three layers of BIONA-V3TM that were 0.6
32 cm thick, 25 cm long and had a total mass of about 60 g. Width of the internal, middle and
33 external layers amounted to 7.5, 9.5 and 12.5 cm, respectively. As a result, edges of the FIERS
5

"
"8","1 layers formed a quasi-plane planting surface. Seeds were inserted between edges of the FIERS
2 layers about 2.5 cm apart to the depth of approximately 0.5 cm.
3 Prior to the experiments, GMRI BIONA-312TM and SAF Osmocote 14-14-14TM quantities,
4 calculated according to the above-outlined procedures, were poured into separating funnels 0f
5 appropriate sizes, covered with water and left for 4 days as required for completion of transitory
6 processes in GMRI and establishment of equilibrium concentrations. In four days, the
7 enrichment columns were ready for mounting into water lines between the water tank and RMs.
8 Nutrient solution obtained by sending water through the GMRI column reached RMs and
9 moistened FIERS. Control plants were fed with the standard nutrient solution prepared according
10 t0 Chesnokov & Bazyrina (1960). Speciﬁed value of salt concentrations in the test nutrient
11 solution was calculated as a sum of salt concentrations in a control solution and in irrigation
12 water prepared by adding Ca2+ and Mg2+ sulfates t0 distilled water (potable water surrogate)
13 (table 1).
14 Planting was performed two days after completion of FIERS maturation and establishment
15 of equilibrium water potential across the RM volume. Seeds were laid every 3 and 6 days in
16 experiment 1 and 2, respectively, in one RM at a time. Ripe shoots were cropped and secondary
17 seeds took their place without regeneration of preceding FIERS. Conditions of the vegetation
18 experiments are presented in table 2.
19 During the experiments, salt concentrations in the nutrient solution were controlled daily
20 by measuring solution conductivity in the mixing vessel. As a control measure, salt
21 concentrations were determined both in fresh and stock nutrient solutions. Total sa1ts
22 concentrations in the solution mineralized using BIONA-312TM were determined every 10 and 7
23 days in experiment 1 and 2, respectively. For this purpose, 25 ml-samples were obtained from a
24 dedicated port between the enrichment column and mixing vessel.
25
26 2. 5. Monitoring and data processing
27 Fresh mass of plant shoots was measured with a Navigator electronic balance (Ohaus,
28 Sweden) with the capacity of 0-200 grams and repeatability of 0.01 g. Total sa1ts concentration
29 in the solution was available from readings of conductivity meter HI7634-00 displayed on
30 controller BL983319-1 which was calibrated in units of salt concentration ranging from 50 mg/l
31 t0 2 000 mg/l, with a 2% margin of error. Temperature and pH were measured with device
32 Expert-pH (Russia). Concentrations of minerals in solution samples were measured repeatedly 4
33 times using the following methods:
34 0 N—NO3' - photometry (Cataldo et a1., 1975);
35 0 N—NH4+ - photometry, indophenol green reaction (Samokhvalov et.a1., 1976);

7 3. Results and Discussion

8

9 3.]. Volume 0fthe enrichment column
10 Applying the enrichment columns in addition to FIERS reduced the overall volume of the
11 mineral nutrition system. Earlier experiments with cultivation of Chinese cabbage on different
12 types of GMRI were aimed at comparative evaluation of speciﬁc productivity of ion-exchange
13 resin substrates as a function of ion capacity (ﬁg. 3). The best results were obtained for the
14 BIONA-312TM substrate; as a result, this GMRI can be recommended for incorporation into the
15 mineral nutrition system. The mineral content 0fBIONA-312TM is summarized in table 3.
16 Table 4 presents calculated fresh biomass of salad crops containing minerals in quantities
17 equivalent to their content in 1 kg of dry BIONA-312TM. Calculations show that GMRI is short
18 of such elements as N, P, and K. To satisfy the demand of plants for these elements, GMRI mass
19 must be 5 to 10 times larger compared with the mass needed to provide plants with bivalent
20 cations, sulphur, and iron. Since all ion-exchange resin substrates have large fractions of ballast
21 substances, GMRI should be used only as a source of elements that plants take in relatively small
22 amounts, i.e. calcium, magnesium and sulphur, that are absent in the majority of SAF brands.
23 Calculation of the amount of BIONA-312TM necessary to supply plants in conveyer-type PGF
24 with these elements (besides the stock of elements in FIERS inside RMs) showed that
25 magnesium as the limiting element for this type of GMRI. Thus, quantities of substrate to be
26 stocked must be governed by levels of this element (table 5). The need of plants for magnesium
27 throughout the period of 72-day cultivation in a PGF can be met with 0.13 kg of dry GMRI.
28 Given the swelling ratio, a minimal volume of the enrichment column must be 0.38 dm3.
29 The results of estimating the time of contact between GMRI and water (T cont) sufﬁcient
30 for reaching an equilibrium concentration of ions in solution are presented in ﬁg. 4. The data
31 suggests that the nitrate-anion concentration reached equilibrium 20 minutes after the start of
32 measurements, thus having dictated the established minimal obligatory contact time of 20
33 minutes. According to expression (3), minimal volume of the enrichment column with the GMRI

7

"
"10","1 (V) that meets this condition is 0.22 dm3, providing for the actual maximal transpiration rate of
2 the crop in the conveyer PGF being equal to 200 cm3/h.
3 Another important characteristic of the enrichment column is the equilibrium salts
4 concentration in outﬂow water. As the stock of GMRI minerals depletes, equilibrium
5 concentration in outﬂow solution also decreases, Which underlies the ineVitable reduction in
6 yields. Dynamic studies of solution concentration at the output of the enrichment column showed
7 that, initially, concentration of salts decreases almost linearly from 1500 mg/l to 600 mg/l.
8 Decrease in salts concentration becomes slower When the rate of water passing through the
9 column reaches about 36 ml per 1 g of GMRI; salts concentration stabilizes at approximately 300
10 mg/l after the amount of water passing through the column reaches about 50 ml per 1 g (ﬁg. 5).
11 Analysis of the composition of solution ﬂowing out of the BIONA-312TM column revealed
12 different dynamics of concentrations of speciﬁc elements. For instance, passage of 50 ml of
13 water through 1 g of GMRI reduced concentrations of nitrogen and potassium almost four—fold
14 and magnesium concentration only in half (ﬁg. 6).
15 Works by several authors (Cometti et al., 2008; Chen et al., 1997) demonstrated the
16 feasibility of planting leaf vegetables in nutrient solutions containing salts in concentrations 0.5
17 to 0.1 of normal (standard) nutrient solutions Without loss in productivity. In this research team’s
18 experiments, speciﬁc water volume that passed through the BIONA-312TM column did not
19 reduce concentrations of nitrogen, potassium or phosphorus below 0.1 normal for
20 Pryanishnikov’s standard solution (1976), and remained Within the range of 50 to 100 ml per 1 g
21 of the substrate (ﬁg. 6a). In the meantime, calcium and magnesium concentration measured at
22 least 400 ml per 1 g (ﬁg. 6b). These data indicate that it is beneﬁcial to use two enrichment
23 columns to separate elements taken in by plants at different rates. Based on results of these
24 studies, the speciﬁc volume of water passing through the column (400 ml per 1 g) can be
25 considered as maximal acceptable for chosen GMRI. In View of the fact that during 72 days of
26 the ground-based experiment With PGF producing 60 g of biomass per day plants transpired
27 about 146 liters of water, the BIONA-312TM mass in the column should be no less than 370
28 grams. This quantity Will ﬁt in an enrichment column 0.68 dm3 in size.
29 To summarize, minimal column volumes calculated from quantities of mineral elements
30 necessary to ensure required productivity, duration of water-ionite contact, and maximum
31 speciﬁc water volume per 1 g of GMRI are equal to 0.38 dm3, 0.22 dm3,and 0.68 dm3,
32 respectively. Consequently, the maximum speciﬁc water volume appeared to be the major
33 parameter limiting the applicability of the column ﬁlled With BIONA-312TM. In View of these
8

"
"11","1 data and using safety factor 1.35, this research team has chosen a 1000 m1 column with 500 g of
2 GMRI BIONA-312TMfor the vegetation experiments .
3 Volume of another column and SAF mass were determined from the balance of mineral
4 elements and compounds in anticipated future crop biomass. The experiments have suggested
5 that dry salts dissolved rapidly and almost fully in water pumped in the column SAF, so that the
6 equilibrium total salts concentration in outﬂow solution was not attainable (table 6). By way of
7 calculation it was shown that, considering the GMRI BIONA-312TM mineral content in the
8 column and the FIERS BIONA-V3TM in the root modules, the speciﬁed productivity of
9 Vitaeycle-T in the 72-day operation period can be achieved by utilizing the mineral nutrition
10 system of the SAF Osmocote 14-14-14TM column with a minimal size of 0.1 dm3 to include 0.1
11 kg of SAF as a minimum.
12
13 3.2. pH autocorrection in substrate solution
14 While water pH varied between 5.0 and 7.9 units, pH in the FIERS BIONA-V3TM pores
15 stabilized at values known as optimal for most of the leaf vegetables, i.e. from 6.0 to 6.6 units;
16 buffer properties of the substrate still remained after its use for growing plants and regeneration
17 (ﬁg. 7). These data show that no pH correction is required for water or nutrient solution pumped
18 into BIONA-V3 inside Vitaeycle-T RMs throughout the speciﬁed period of operation.
19
20 3.3.Dynamics of changes in concentration of dissolved salts provided by the mineral
21 nutrition system
22 Dynamics of total sa1ts concentration in two major units of the mineral nutrition system —
23 the enrichment column and mixing vessel — is presented in ﬁg. 7. In both experiments, total salts
24 concentrations in the solution ﬂowing out of the enrichment column steadily decreased, attaining
25 their respective minimum values on approximately day 40, and then did not change signiﬁcantly.
26 In this period, the total concentration of dissolved salts dropped about 4.5 times so that, in terms
27 of minerals, the solution was Virtually identical to potable water pumped into the enrichment
28 column. Speciﬁc water volume injected into the column until BIONA-312TM was completely
29 exhausted made up 99 ml per 1 gram under the photon ﬂux density of approximately 250
30 pmol/(mZ-s) and 69 ml per 1 gram when PPF increased 1.7 times. However, because of the
31 regulator discharging the solution from the Osmocote 14-14-14TM column according to the
32 conductivity meter input signal, in both experiments with conveyer-type PGF the total salts
33 concentration in the mixing vessel did not fall below preset values in the course of two
34 sequential vegetation cycles (ﬁg. 7).
9

"
"12","1 Cyclic functioning of the regulator, connected with the conductivity meter, and range of
2 sa1ts concentrations variations in the mixing vessel are presented in ﬁg. 8. Data in the ﬁgure
3 demonstrate that the solution was discharged into the mixing vessel within time interval of 30 to
4 60 minutes. Minimal interval between the regulator iterations was recorded prior to crop
5 harvesting in the conveyer step where crop transpiration was the highest. It should be noted that
6 irrespective of the length of time between successive solution discharges from the SAF column,
7 sa1ts concentration in the mixing vessel did not fall below speciﬁed values more than by 2 %.
8 Mean total concentration of dissolved salts in the mixing vessel, calculated for each cycle, was
9 845 mg/l, compared with speciﬁed minimal value 780 mg/l with the variation amplitude no
10 greater than 5-7 % of the average.
11 The results proved the capability of the research team’s mineral nutrition system to
12 automatically stabilize sa1ts concentration in the nutrient solution with acceptable deviation.
13 Volume of the nutrient solution obtained using the designed mineral nutrition system was
14 sufﬁcient to sustain more than two months of leaf vegetables cultivation in conveyer-type PGF
15 with PPF in the range of 200 to 450 umol/(m2°s).
16
17 3.4.Speciﬁc mass and volume offertilizers in enrichment columns and root module
18 substrates per unit ofuseful plant mass
19 Planned productivity of salad plants in Vitaeycle-T averaged about 150 g/d from 1 m2 of
20 illuminated surface. In laboratory tests, productivity of the conveyer crop fed by the mineral
21 nutrition system and illuminated by red and blue LEDs generating PPF = 250 umol/(mz's) was
22 almost half of expected values. PPF increase to 4204150 umol/(m2°s) resulted in harvesting crop
23 which exceeded planned productivity by 50-60 % (ﬁg. 9). As a result, it appears that light level
24 when using LEDs in a Vitamin PGF with the average productivity of 60 g/d should be about 300
25 — 400 umol/(mz's).
26 Comparison of speciﬁc productivity of Chinese cabbage grown solely in FIERS BIONA-
27 V3TM and the same FIERS combined with enrichment columns is given in ﬁg. 10. Calculated
28 productivity of crops raised on FIERS made up about 0.8 g of fresh mass per 1 g of dry BIONA-
29 V3TM . Introduction of two enrichment columns into the mineral nutrition system increased
30 speciﬁc productivity in terms of 1 g of total resin substrates and SAF mass 2.4 and 2.8 times,
31 with PPF averaging 250 and 420 umol/(m2 's), respectively. Speciﬁc productivity per unit of total
32 resin substrate volume within the mineral nutrition system increased more than 15 times in
33 comparison with crops grown on FIERS only.

"13","1 4. Conclusions
2 ° Designed mineral nutrition system With FIERS BIONA-V3TM set in the root zone is able
3 to automatically maintain adequate levels of water potential, concentrations of mineral
4 salts and pH inside cylindrical RMS of the conveyer-type Vitamin PGF.
5 ° Designed mineral system is capable to support growth of no less than two nominal
6 successive crops in each RM Without FIERS replacement.
7 ° Designed mineral system halves the mass and reduces more than 15-fold the volume of
8 FIERS necessary for the functioning of conveyer-type Vitamin PGF on-board of a space
9 vehicle.
