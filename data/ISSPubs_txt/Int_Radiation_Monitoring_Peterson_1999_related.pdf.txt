Abstract
Estimating uncertainty in lifetime cancer risk for human exposure to space radiation is a unique challenge. Conventional
risk assessment with 10w-linear-energy-transfer (LET)—based risk from Japanese atomic bomb survivor studies may be
inappropriate for relativistic protons and nuclei in space due to track structure effects. This paper develops a Monte Carlo
mixture model (MCMM) for transferring additive, National Institutes of Health multiplicative, and multiplicative excess
cancer incidence risks based on Japanese atomic bomb survivor data to determine excess incidence risk for various US
astronaut exposure proﬁles. The MCMM serves as an anchor point for future risk projection methods involving biophysical
models of DNA damage from space radiation. Lifetime incidence risks of radiation-induced cancer for the MCMM based on
10w-LET Japanese data for nonleukemia (all cancers except leukemia) were 2.77% (90% conﬁdence limit, 0.75—11.34) for
males exposed to 1 SV at age 45 and 2.20% (90% conﬁdence limit, 0.59—10.12) for males exposed at age 55. For females,
mixture model risks for nonleukemia exposed separately to 1 SV at ages of 45 and 55 were 2.98% (90% conﬁdence limit,
0.90—11.70) and 2.44% (90% conﬁdence limit, 0.70—10.30), respectively. Risks for high-LET 200 MeV protons (LET = 0.45
keV/ptm), 1 MeV a-particles (LET = 100 keV/ lam), and 600 MeV iron particles (LET = 180 keV/ptm) were scored on a
per particle basis by determining the particle ﬂuence required for an average of one particle per cell nucleus of area 100
ptmz. Lifetime risk per proton was 2.68 X 10—2% (90% conﬁdence limit, 0.79 X 10_3%—0.514 >< 10_2%). For a-particles,
lifetime risk was 14.2% (90% conﬁdence limit, 2.5%—31.2%). Conversely, lifetime risk per iron particle was 23.7% (90%
conﬁdence limit, 4.5%—53.0%). Uncertainty in the DDREF for high-LET particles may be less than that for 10w-LET
radiation because typically there is very little dose—rate dependence. Probability density functions for high-LET radiation
quality and dose—rate may be preferable to conventional risk assessment approaches. Nuclear reactions and track structure
effects in tissue may not be properly estimated by existing data using in Vitro models for estimating RBEs. The method used
here is being extended to estimate uncertainty in spacecraft shielding effectiveness in various space radiation environments.
