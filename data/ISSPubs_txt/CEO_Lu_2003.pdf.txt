One of my favorite things to do when I have time off ""'
is to just watch the world go by. Whenever I get a
chance, I spend time just observing the planet below.
It turns out you can see a lot more from up here than
you might expect. First off, we aren’t as far away as
some people think—our orbit is only about 240 miles
above the surface of the Earth. While this is high
enough to see that the Earth is round (believe me, it
is), we are still just barely skimming the surface when
you consider that the diameter of the Earth is over
8000 miles.

So how much of the Earth can we see at one time?
When you are standing on the ground, the horizon is a
few miles away. When in a tall building, the horizon
can be as far as about 40 miles. From the 188, the

"
"2","distance to the horizon is over 1000 miles. So from
horizon to horizon, the section of the Earth you can
see at any one time is a patch about 2000 miles across,
almost enough to see the entire United States at once.
It isn’t exactly seeing the Earth like a big blue marble,
it’s more like having your face up against a big blue
beach ball. When I look out a Window that faces
straight down, it is actually pretty hard to see the
horizon—you need to get your face very close to the
Window. So What you see out a Window like that is a
moving patch of ground (or water). From the time a
place on the ground comes into View until When it
disappears over the horizon is only a few minutes
since we are traveling 300 miles per minute.

length of a football ﬁeld). At a distance of 1000 miles,
that translates into a height of about 20 miles. There
really isn’t a sharp boundary to the atmosphere, but it
gets rapidly thinner the higher you go. Not many
airplanes can ﬂy higher than about 10 miles, and the
highest mountains are only about 6 miles high. Above
about 30 miles there is very little air to speak of, but at
night you can see a faint glow from what little air
there is at that height.
