IMPORTANCE As durations of manned space missions increase, it is imperative to H
understand the Iong-term consequence of microbial exposure on human health in a
closed human habitat. To date, studies aimed at bacterial and fungal contamination
of space vessels have highlighted species compositions biased toward hardy, persis-
tent organisms capable of withstanding harsh conditions. In the current study, we
assessed traits of two independent Aspergillus fumigatus strains isolated from the In—
ternational Space Station. Ubiquitously found in terrestrial soil and atmospheric envi—
ronments, A. fumigatus is a signiﬁcant opportunistic fungal threat to human health,
particularly among the immunocompromised. Using two weII-known clinical isolates
of A. fumigatus as comparators, we found that both ISS isolates exhibited normal in
vitro growth and chemical stress tolerance yet caused higher lethality in a vertebrate
model of invasive disease. These ﬁndings substantiate the need for additional stud-
ies of physical traits and biological activities of microbes adapted to microgravity
and other extreme extraterrestrial conditions.

icroorganisms are unavoidable inhabitants of human-made structures in space
due to anthropogenic sources, including human and cargo movement (1). Our

understanding of how the stressors of such environments, which include microgravity
and increased exposure to irradiation, inﬂuence microbial biology over time remains in
its infancy (2). Changes in microbial community composition and microbial species
characteristics have the potential to affect human health and safety, particularly in light
of the fact that extended periods of time in space have been shown to alter vertebrate
and human immunity (3, 4). Furthermore, as durations of manned space missions
increase, such as going to Mars, it becomes of heightened importance to understand 9
the breadth and potential consequences of host-microbe interactions in crew habita- 5
tion. There exists an unmet need for studies characterizing individual microbial species %
isolated directly from space environments, as sampling experiments to date have 8
aimed at understanding changes in microbial community composition at the species 8
level (4—6), and it has been documented that simulated space environments provide a :h
poor comparison for what is actually observed in orbit (7), highlighting a need for g
additional experimentation with samples derived from space environments. :3-

While, unsurprisingly, most of the sampled bacterial diversity from space environ- g
ments aligns with commensal organisms (8), many fungi represent a unique compo— §
nent of microbial communities in space environments, as their populations are not a
replenished by virtue of human presence, suggesting they have exploited or adapted ?-
to a proliferative niche aboard these human-made structures. Fungal colonization of g
space vessels is nothing new, as various species have been isolated from the Skylab, b)
Mir, and various modules of the International Space Station (ISS) (United States, Japan’s g
KIBO, and the Russian segments) (5, 6, 9—13). Fungi have been reported to cause b
damage to electrical and structural components through the decomposition of wire (é
insulation and window gaskets (13). The most commonly sampled fungal genera from g
space environments include the terrestrially ubiquitous sporulating molds Cladospo- Z
rium, Penicillium, and Aspergillus. Airborne spores, also known as conidia, are ubiquitous 2
in terrestrial environments and can exacerbate pulmonary allergic reactions (14) and ‘39
cause life-threatening invasive infections after germinating in immunocompromised 0'
individuals (15, 16). Among airborne fungi, Aspergillus fumigatus is the most frequently 93
encountered agent of pulmonary complications and invasive infections, as infections a
can result in invasive aspergillosis (IA) in immunocompromised populations, with “N
average mortality rates of 50% even with proper diagnosis and treatment (17). 3

Globally encountered in soil and air, A. fumigatus is well adapted to colonizing g
diverse environments through its metabolic diversity, broad stress and thermal toler- ‘<
ances, and easily dispersed conidia (18—20). Likely underlying the ubiquity and patho— ‘8
genic capacity of A. fumigatus is a great degree of genetic diversity observed among 8
strains from diverse environmental and clinical sources (21—23). While many factors H
may contribute to the ubiquity of A. fumigatus, the production of small bioactive
molecules, or secondary metabolites (SMs), has become of particular interest, as these
compounds have been shown to play central roles in niche exploitation, stress toler-
ance, and virulence (17, 24, 25). Considering A. fumigatus as a ubiquitously encountered
opportunistic pathogen with great metabolic and genetic diversity, it is an organism of
particular interest to monitor and examine as a contaminant of human space vessels.

Here, we report an initial characterization of two A. fumigatus strains isolated from
different sources of the 155. Our experimental approach aimed to investigate each
strain’s genetic origins and characteristics, in vitro growth and stress tolerance, second-
ary metabolite production, and virulence. Given the importance of A. fumigatus as an
opportunistic pathogen, both 155 strains were studied in comparison to two well-
known clinical isolates to assess pathogenic traits that may be of consequence to
human health.

RESULTS
Identiﬁcation of A. fumigatus sampled from the ISS. Air and surface sampling during
the Microbial Observatory Experiments on the ISS identiﬁed numerous bacterial and
fungal isolates (7). For this study, we chose to focus on two independently sampled
strains of A. fumigatus which were initially identiﬁed by morphological characteristics
and later veriﬁed by internal transcribed spacer (ITS) region sequencing (ITS sequences
for ISSFT—021 and |F1SW—F4 are available under GenBank accession numbers KT832787
and KX675260, respectively). Strain ISSFT-021 was sampled from a high—efﬁciency
particulate arrestance (HEPA) ﬁlter, and strain |F1SW—F4 was obtained from a hard
surface adjacent to the cupola window (Fig. 1A) via wiping surface materials. By nature
of this sampling method, it is impossible to know exact residence times aboard the ISS
for each strain. U
Whole—genome sequencing (WGS) of ISSFT-021 and |F1SW—F4 (26) reveal 54,960 and g
52,129 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) compared to the clinical isolate and 2
model laboratory strain Af293, respectively, which is not outside the genetic diversity 8
observed among 95 sequenced A. fumigatus isolates (Fig. 1B). Figure 1C shows a %
phylogeny of these isolates of A. fumigatus inferred using maximum likelihood from £3;
SNP sequences covered in every genome (147,792 total SNP positions). The tree also 8
includes information on individual isolate mating type, clinical or environmental origin, 3-
and also geographical location. This analysis illustrates the genomic variation that exists g
with A. fumigatus and, moreover, suggests that we are unable to predict phenotypic §
characteristics (i.e., virulence) based on clinical/environmental origin, mating type, or a
geographical isolation source. With regard to mating type, strains ISSFT-021 and CEA1O 1:37
(another clinical isolate and model laboratory strain) are MAT1—1, while |F1SW—F4 and £2
Af293 are MAT1—2. Interestingly, ISSFT—021 and |F1SW—F4 show a close relationship to g
the patient isolate Af300 (27), suggesting these three strains may have arisen from a (D
common origin. Figure S1 in the supplemental material shows the same phylogenic a
data represented in a phylogram. As it has been suggested previously that genetic a
consequences resulting from irradiation exposure during time in space may manifest as 3
insertions and deletions (indels) over point mutations (28—30), we analyzed ISSFT-021, 3
|F1SW—F4, and CEA1O and averages from all sequenced isolates included in this study g
against the reference genome (Af293) and found no obvious enrichment for indels in ($3
the ISS isolates (see Fig. 52 in the supplemental material). (33.
Visual characterization and growth rates of ISS strains in vitro. To assess £2
basic physiological phenotypes of strains ISSFT-021 and |F1SW—F4, growth characteris— a
tics of the ISS strains were investigated on deﬁned glucose minimal medium (GMM) “N
(31). Gross visual assessment of point-inoculated GMM plates revealed slight differ— 3
ences in colony diameter and pigment production after a 5-day incubation (Fig. 2A), 03
indicating that each strain possesses unique physical and chemical properties under 2-
these conditions. An examination of radial growth rates revealed that both ISS strains (2
signiﬁcantly outgrew both Af293 and CEA1O at all time points investigated (Fig. 28), 8
which is consistent with previous reports of strain-dependent variations in growth rates H
ofA. fumigatus isolates (21) as well as increased biomass production for some microbes
during exposure to space environments (32). As early spore germination rates may
favor niche exploitation and establishment of robust growth (21), we next sought to
determine whether ISS isolates exhibited different germination dynamics in vitro.
Figure 2C shows there were no differences in germination rates between ISSFT-021,
|F1SW—F4, and CEA1O in liquid GMM, as nearly all spores germinated after an 8—h
incubation, while Af293 showed a marked delay in germination.
ISS strains show no enhanced resistance to chemical stresses in vitro. While
unstressed growth (Fig. 2) revealed several differences between ISS and patient isolate
strains, it is reasonable to posit that resistance to stressful conditions may play a greater
role in colonization and propagation aboard harsh space vessel environments. There-
fore, we challenged all strains to a variety of classical chemical stresses on GMM to assay
susceptibility to osmotic stress (sodium chloride [NaCl]), DNA damage stress (methyl

supplemented media compared to that under unstressed growth conditions. No 2
signiﬁcant differences in growth reduction were observed for either ISS strain in (SD
comparison to Af293 or CEA10 (Fig. 38). For oxidative stress tests, we chose a diffusion g
assay (33) to reduce experimental variation in working with this chemical (unpublished :
observations). Zones of inhibition (Fig. 3C) were measured to infer sensitivity to 91
hydrogen peroxide. No signiﬁcant differences were observed between ISS strains N
regarding hydrogen peroxide sensitivity (Fig. 3D); however, both were signiﬁcantly 3
more resistant than Af293 and less resistant than CEA10, demonstrating an intermedi— 3

Secondary metabolite analysis among ISS and clinical isolates. SM proﬁles of cg
ISSFT—021, |F1SW—F4, CEA10, and Af293 were examined after culture on solid GMM by i
using high—performance liquid chromatography—photodiode array detection—mass
spectroscopy (HPL-DAD-MS) analysis. Examination of the SM proﬁles revealed a distinct
chemical signature for each strain under the condition tested (Fig. 4A). Detailed yield
analysis of each SM produced was carried out (Fig. 48). Compared to Af293, an increase
in fumigaclavine A production was observed with |F1SW-F4 (P = 0.0001) but not with
ISSFT—021, whereas a signiﬁcant decrease in fumigaclavine C production was noticed in
both strains (P = 0.04 and 0.0001 in ISSFT-021 and |F1SW—F4, respectively). Fumiquina—
zoline production increased in |SSFT—021 (P = 0.0004) but not in |F1SW—F4 compared to
the two controls. Pyripyropene A production increased in both ISSFT—021 and |F1SW—F4
(P = 0.0063 and 0.0018, respectively). Observed SM yields for CEA10 were lower than
for any other strain, with an observed decrease in production of all but two compounds
(pyripyropene A and fumagillin) (Fig. 4A). Nevertheless, as production of SMs in media
does not necessarily replicate the pattern of SM production during infections, the
potential in vivo SM proﬁles of the ISS strains remain unclear.

While a detailed analysis of SNPs with potential consequence on SM regulation and 3
production was beyond the scope of the present study, Data Set S1 in the supplemen- g
tal material shows polymorphisms within 26 SM gene clusters that produce either 1
known SMs or have strong bioinformatic support to produce a likely SM (34). The 55""
combined analysis of CEA10, |SSFT—021, and |F1SW—F4 identiﬁed 1,578 variants in 8
comparison with Af293 within the boundaries of the 26 SM gene clusters, and 504 of 3
these variants were predicted to result in nonsynonymous substitution in an SM cluster 0'
gene (see Data Set S1). Importantly, our analysis corroborated the previously published 3
point mutation R202L in thD (Afu8900200), which results in loss of fumitremorgin g
production in Af293 (35), as well as the previously described frameshift mutation in (A
Tch in the CEA10 trypacidin cluster that leads to loss of function of the trypacidin
polyketide synthase (36). A metabolite between pyripyropene A (peak no. 5) and
fumagillin (peak no. 6) (Fig. 4A, starred) was observed via liquid chromatography—mass
spectrometry (LC/MS) in the CEA10, |SSFT—021, and |F1SW—F4 strains (see Fig. S3 in the
supplemental material). We used high-resolution mass spectrometry (494.2276 positive
mode) to obtain a proposed molecular formula of C27H31O6N3 for the compound (see
Fig. S4 in the supplemental material). A chemical database (Reaxys) search using the
proposed formula revealed no known A. fumigatus metabolite that matched this
formula. However, the metabolites versicamide F from Aspergillus versicolor (37) and
taichunamides C and F from Aspergillus taichungensis (38) matched the proposed
formula. These ﬁndings might indicate that the compound is a previously uncharac-
terized prenylated indole alkaloid produced by A. fumigatus.

sure between astronauts and A. fumigatus, it is of high importance to investigate the g
virulence potential of these isolates. Therefore, we tested the virulence of both ISS 3
strains against CEA10 and Af293 in a larval zebraﬁsh model of IA, which has been shown g
to recapitulate key aspects of disease observed in murine models and human disease 1
(39, 40). As immunocompetent zebraﬁsh larvae, like humans and mice, do not succumb 9""
to lethal infection following A. fumigatus challenge (39), we utilized neutrophiI-deﬁcient B
larvae [Tg(mpx:mCherry—ZA-Rac2D57N)] (41) to investigate virulence differences be- a
tween strains. Recapitulating previous reports in a murine infection model (27), we 0'
found that CEA10 was more virulent than Af293 (P < 0.0001), while |SSFT—021 caused :
signiﬁcantly more lethality than CEA10 (P = 0.0075) (Fig. 5A). Furthermore, no signif— g
icant difference was observed in virulence between |SSFT-021 and |F1SW—F4 (P > 0.1), (A
while |F1SW-F4, like |SSFT-021 (Fig. 5A), was signiﬁcantly more virulent than CEA10 (P =
0.0025) (Fig. SB).
DISCUSSION
In the present study, we investigated two independently isolated strains ofA. fumigatus
from the ISS for differences in genetic makeup, growth characterizations, stress toler-
ance, secondary metabolite production, and virulence. While microbial colonization of
space vessels is unavoidable and is well-established in the literature (1, 8), less under-
stood is how the unique stresses found aboard space vessels, such as increased
irradiation and microgravity, affect microorganisms and their biology. Therefore, as
A. fumigatus is the most signiﬁcant airborne opportunistic mold pathogen of humans
(42), it became prudent to investigate the ISS A. fumigatus strains for factors that may
affect health-related interactions with astronauts aboard the ISS and initiate lines of
investigation into how space ﬂight may inﬂuence this particular pathogen.

Samples from HEPA ﬁlters, 16 surface locations, 12 air samples, and debris collected 8
using vacuum cleaners across multiple spaceﬂights during the Microbial Observatory 3“
Experiments (7) revealed the presence of many microbial species aboard the ISS. 3
Among ~200 bacterial and fungal isolates identiﬁed using molecular methods (7), a
fungal strains were particularly enriched with members of the genera Penicillium, E
Aspergillus, and Rodoturulla. However, only two isolates were identiﬁed as A. fumigatus 5
from these samples; one each from a 40-month-old HEPA ﬁlter (|SSFT-021) and a surface %
location adjacent to the cupola window (|F1SW-F4) (Fig. 1A). Interestingly, since the (:3—
inception of the ISS, ~20 years of environmental monitoring did not reveal the presence E6
of A. fumigatus (43). Considering the environmental ubiquity of this species, this '8
anomaly might be partly due to collections from small surface areas (25 cm2), compared 3
to the larger 1-m2 sampling areas adapted during this study. In addition, regular ISS 2
operation and environmental monitoring protocols utilized conventional methods, in (E
which the isolation of Aspergillus was reported but not identiﬁed to the species level 3
(43). Unfortunately, ISS operations did not archive any fungal strains isolated during Z
these 20 years of operation; therefore, we could not address whether or not any of the 2
Aspergillus isolates were A. fumigatus. Hence, even though A. fumigatus is ubiquitous in (ED
the terrestrial atmospheres and would thus be an unsurprising contaminant of the ISS, g
this is the ﬁrst report about the isolation of A. fumigatus from the ISS. :
Following initial culture and ITS sequence-based identiﬁcation of the isolates as p1
A. fumigatus, we undertook WGS to facilitate the current and future studies of |SSFT-021 B
and |F1SW—F4 (26). Analysis of SNPs among all publicly available sequenced isolates 3
(>100 total; 95 unique isolates included in the present study) across a global range of 0'
clinical and environmental sources shows considerable genetic diversity, consistent 2
with previous reports of genetic variance in A. fumigatus (22). Given that we are unable g
to know how, when, and where |SSFT-021 and |F1SW-F4 initially colonized the ISS, it is (.9.-
curious that both strains bare the closest relationship to the strains Af300 and JN1O (27)
(Fig. 1C; see also Fig. S1 in the supplemental material). Af300 was isolated in 1995 in
Manchester, United Kingdom, from a leukemia patient (David Denning, personal com—
munication), and JN1O is an environmental isolate of unknown sampling origin. Further
clouding the origins of these strains is that cargo shipments to the ISS are manufac-
tured and launched from all over the world.
Notably, both ISS isolates show no enhanced accumulation of SNPs (Fig. 18; see also
Fig. 52 in the supplemental material), suggesting that life aboard the space station was
not accompanied by an accumulation of mutations presumably from enhanced expo-
sure to irradiation and microgravity; however, since the proper terrestrial control strains
do not exist for |SSFT-021 and |F1SW—F4, we cannot determine/quantify mutations that
may have accumulated during time aboard the ISS. Interestingly, previous data suggest
that DNA damage resulting from time aboard the ISS may favor chromosomal aberra-
tions and large deletions over point mutations (28—30), a conclusion that may have

been fueled by studies that reported ﬁnding no detectable mutations from time in
space, although these experiments utilized experimental setups that would favor
detection of point mutations over large genetic lesions, or the studies were possibly too
short in duration for mutations to accumulate (44). Sequence analysis with ISS A. fu-
migatus strains suggested that there is no enrichment for any type of mutation we
could identify through our resequencing-based mapping approach, namely, indels, in
comparison with Af293 (see Fig. 52), yet it remains to be determined whether A. fu-
migatus possesses inherent characteristics that would facilitate maintenance of
genomic integrity over other biological systems in space (including humans and other
eukaryotes) from which mutation data have been inferred.
Our reported in vitro analysis showing increased radial growth rates for space
isolates versus clinical isolates (Fig. 2) is not without precedent, as enhanced fungal U
growth from Aspergillus and Penicillium species recovered from Mir, compared to O
terrestrial reference strains, has previously been reported (8). However, there is a :55
considerable difference among growth rates for terrestrial strains of A. fumigatus, and 8—;
so whether or not the increased growth rate observed in this report is a consequence %
of life in space (i.e., mutation) or simply due to natural variation is not possible to 0-
determine without comparison to original terrestrial isolates. While a detailed analysis 3“
of speciﬁc SNPs in the ISS isolates was beyond the scope of our present study, the 3
number tota| SNP differences of ISSFT-021 and |FiSW-F4 compared to Af293 were a
within the range of documented variance among existing sequences of environmental E
A. fumigatus strains (Fig. 1), suggesting that, without a more detailed analysis, the ISS 5
strains likely reﬂect genetic diversity already found on Earth (22). %
While it is conceivable that differential growth rates among A. fumigatus isolates (21) (:3—
may favor more rapidly growing strains in gaining a niche foothold, the stresses aboard E6
the ISS likely inﬂuence microbial colonization to a greater extent than de novo growth '8
rates. As such, stress tolerance may play a more dominant role in the ability of 3
A. fumigatus to colonize harsh niches. Given that the stress response pathways of Q
A. fumigatus are unarguably involved in this organism’s environmental ubiquity and its (3
leading position as an opportunistic pathogen (18, 45, 46), it is still unclear how existing 3
genetic heterogeneity plays a role in stress tolerance. While limited in scope, we found Z
no enhanced ability of the ISS strains over Af293 and CEAiO to tolerate a diversity of 2
chemical stresses (Fig. 3), suggesting that stress tolerance may not play a dominant role (SD
in A. fumigatus persistence aboard the ISS. Future studies aimed at guiding enhanced g
disinfectant protocols aboard space vessels should consider these data and pursue :
effective methods for clearing surfaces of A. fumigatus. However, it was observed that p1
both ISSFT—021 and |F15W—F4 were signiﬁcantly more resistant to UV irradiation than 8
clinical isolates (26), and current studies are under way that will leverage sequence data a
and molecular approaches to elucidate these mechanisms. It is critical to note that care 0'
must be taken in interpreting these results, as terrestrial equivalents or reference 2
strains, even if identiﬁed as the same species, do not represent experimental controls. c
Future studies aimed at determining the effects of microgravity and space irradiation a
on A. fumigatus biology will require direct comparison to terrestrial clones not sub-
jected to time in space.
Examination of secondary metabolite proﬁles of clinical and ISS strains revealed
differences in SM production (Fig. 4). Whether these changes are due to adaptations to
unfavorable environmental conditions, such as low nutrient availability, enhanced
irradiation, and microgravity, remains to be determined and will be the focus of future
studies. One clear example linking genomic data to SM production was found with
strain |FiSW—F4, with which increased levels of fumigaclavine A (47) were detected,
whereas fumigaclavine C (48) production was signiﬁcantly decreased (Fig. 4). The prenyl
transferase FgaPTi in A. fumigatus is known to be responsible for the prenylation of
fumigaclavine A to form fumigaclavine C (49), and in the |F1$W—F4 strain there exists a
frameshift mutation in fgaPTi (see Data Set Si in the supplemental material) that might
be responsible for the observed accumulation of fumigaclavine A. Additional differ—
ences in metabolite production between the two ISS strains compared to Af293 could

be due to SNPs found within regions of the secondary metabolite gene clusters (see
Data Set S1). Fumagillin, a toxic SM (50), is produced by both Af293 and CEA10, while
production was signiﬁcantly decreased in both of the ISS strains (Fig. 4). While fumag—
illin can alter neutrophil responses to pathogenic stimuli (51, 52), among other ele-
ments of host defense (17), it has been proposed as a potential virulence factor.
Interestingly, the more virulent ISS strains showed lower fumagillin production, sug-
gesting that in vitro fumagillin production proﬁles may not be accurate predictors of
virulence potential, based on our in vivo ﬁndings with the neutrophiI—deﬁcient larval
zebraﬁsh model. Monomethylsulochrin, a proposed precursor in the trypacidin path-
way, is produced by both ISS strains and Af293 but not by CEA10, despite the ability of
this strain to produce trypacidin (36). However, our study was insufﬁcient to pinpoint
which, if any, of the metabolites has inﬂuence on the increased virulence observed in U
the two ISS strains, and additional experiments will be necessary to identify the 0
connection between increased virulence and speciﬁc metabolite production. :55
As A. fumigatus is a ubiquitous environmental organism and multifaceted opportu- 8—3
nistic pathogen (19), many studies have aimed at understanding traits underlying %
pathogenesis and whether a strain’s virulence potential can be inferred preemptively 0-
and indirectly from isolation source, physical traits, or genetic data. Interestingly, 3“
studies have been unable to consistently support the hypothesis that clinical strains 3
have undergone a selective bottleneck and are therefore more virulent than environ— g
mental isolates (21, 22, 53). As both ISSFT-021 and |F1SW-F4 are environmental isolates, E
albeit from a highly unusual environment, our ﬁnding that both ISS strains are more 5
virulent than the two clinical strains reinforces the idea that isolation source is not %
predictive of pathogenic potential and also reinforces the conclusion that all strains of (:3—
A. fumigatus, regardless of origin, possess an infective potential (54). Alternatively, EB
previous reports have suggested a correlation between in vitro growth rates and '8
virulence (21, 55). While we did observe higher growth and germination rates of ISS 3
isolates in vitro (Fig. 2), the greatest difference was the slower growth and germination Q
of Af293 compared to all others, which may contribute to the lower virulence of this (3
strain; however, the identical germination rates and slightly reduced radia| growth of g
CEA1O are less suggestive of an underlying inﬂuence on virulence potential. Addition— Z
ally, the growing body of literature characterizing A. fumigatus strain-dependent phe- 2
notypes has revealed broad phenotypes, including toxin production (54, 56) and host CED
immune responses (27), that suggest a complex milieu of factors involved in predicting g
the outcome of host-A. fumigatus interactions. Furthermore, there has been speculation 1
that mating type (MAT1—1, MAT1—2) may offer insight into the pathogenic potential of p1
A. fumigatus isolates (53, 57), yet this supposition has been challenged by more recent 8
studies using isogenic mating-type pairs (58). Both ISS strains are closely related a
(Fig. 1C; see also Fig. S1 in the supplemental material) but possess opposite mating 0'
types (Fig. 1C) and were found to be more virulent than either Af293 (MAT1—2) or CEA1O ‘<
(MAT1—1) and equally virulent as each other (Fig. 5). Regardless of these strains coming (2
from uncontrolled genetic backgrounds, our ﬁnding supports current data that suggest a
there is no link between mating type and virulence. Despite the ISS isolates coming
from an extreme environment and possessing opposite mating types, different growth
rates in vitro, and distinct SM proﬁles between themselves and Af293 and CEA10, our
cumulative data are unable to offer a predictive potential of enhanced virulence for
these strains.
This study has shown the existence of distinct A. fumigatus isolates on the ISS. The
origin of these strains remains unknown, yet analysis of genome sequence data showed
their relationship to 93 other sequenced genomes of this species and revealed a close
relationship to a known patient isolate, Af300. Considering the genetic diversity and
environmental ubiquity of A. fumigatus, it is not surprising to observe signiﬁcant
phenotypic variation among isolates, including growth rates, stress tolerance, SM
production, and virulence, with virulence being a multifaceted phenotype in this
opportunistic pathogen and likely a culmination of traits that render the pathogenic
potential of any given iso|ate difﬁcult to predict. Altogether, the present study rein-

forces the idea that all A. fumigatus strains, regardless of isolation source or genetic
origin, represent potential pathogens and should serve to guide current and future
sampling and maintenance regimens for space vessels.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Isolation and veriﬁcation of A. fumigatus isolates from the ISS. Particulates associated with HEPA
ﬁlters were scraped, and approximately 1 mg of material was resuspended in sterile phosphate-buffered
saline (PBS; pH 7.4) before being spread onto potato dextrose agar (PDA) plates (7). To collect samples
from cupola surfaces, sterile polyester wipes were used. The sampling wipes were assembled and
manifested in the Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL, Pasadena, CA) prior to space ﬂight. Brieﬂy, each
polyester wipe (9 by 9 in.; ITW Texwipe, Mahwah, NJ) was folded two times and soaked in 15 ml of sterile
molecular-grade water (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, M0) for 30 min, followed by transfer to a sterile zip lock
bag (59). The wipes were packed along with the other kit elements at Ames Research Center (ARC;
Moffett Field, CA) and included TC (total count, tryptic soy agar) and SDA (Sabouraud dextrose agar) U
contact slides (Hycon, EMD Millipore, Billerica, MA), Opsite adhesive tape (Smith & Nephew, |nc., London, E
United Kingdom), and an air sampling device with gelatin ﬁlters (Sartorius, Gottingen, Germany). Each :5
sampling kit was sent to the ISS as a part of the Space-X cargo and was returned to Earth on Soyuz TM-14 a
or the Dragon capsule. The kits were delivered to JPL immediately after returning to Earth. During each a
sampling session on the ISS, only one astronaut collected samples from eight different locations, using CD
wipes and contact slides. Each wipe was used to collect a sample 1 m2. The control wipe (environmental 9;
control) was only taken out from the zip lock bag, unfolded, and packed back into the zip lock. The 8
samples were stored at 4°C until the return trip to Earth and subsequent processing. 3
The sample processing took place in a class 10K cleanroom at JPL immediately upon delivery of the :3-
return kits. Each wipe was aseptically taken out from the zip lock bag and transferred to a 500-ml sterile g
bottle containing 200 ml of sterile PBS. The bottle with the wipe was shaken for 2 min followed by 3
concentration with a concentrating pipette (InnovaPrep, Drexel, MO) using 0.45-p.m hollow ﬁber 5
polysulfone tips and PBS elution ﬂuid. The environmental control and each sample were concentrated U)
to 4 ml. A 200-p.l aliquot was serially diluted in PBS to estimate the cultivable population. 1:33-
Concentrated samples were diluted in PBS (up to 10—6 of each original sample), plated on the media SB
(100 MI; in duplicates) Reasoner’s 2A agar (R2A) for environmental bacteria and PDA for fungi, and _CD
incubated at 25°C for 7 days; CFU were then counted. A minimum of ﬁve isolates of distinct morphol- CD
ogies was picked up for each location from each type of medium. The isolates were archived in the g
semisolid R2A or PDA slants (agar media diluted 1:10) and stored at room temperature. For identiﬁcation 0
purposes, each fungal isolate was revived on PDA medium. Once a culture was conﬁrmed to be pure, 6
DNA extraction was performed by colony PCR (UltraClean DNA kit [Mo Bio, Carlsbad, CA] or Maxwell \
automated system [Promega, Madison, WI]). Concurrently, two cryobead stocks (Copan Diagnostics, g
Murrieta, CA) were prepared for each isolate. Fungal DNA was used for PCR to amplify ITS regions with Z
primers ITS1F (5’ TTGGTCATI'TAGAGGAAGTAA 3’) and Tw13 (5’ GGTCCGTGTI'I'CAAGACG 3’) (60) fol- O
lowing an established protocol (61). The fungal sequences were searched against the UNITE database (<1)
and identiﬁed based on the closest similarity to ITS sequences of fungal type strains (62). 3
Publicly available raw sequencing reads of all A. fumigatus strains used in this study were down- 0'
loaded from either the NCBI Sequence Read Archive (SRA) or the E81 European Nucleotide Archive (ENA) (.2
for comparison to the ISS isolates. SNPs were called against the Af293 genome reference (NCBI accession —\
number GCA_000002655.1) using the Snippy pipeline and default settings (63). Brieﬂy, the Snippy .01
program aligns reads to the genome reference sequence by using BWA v0.7.12-r1044 (64), and variants [\D
are called using the FreeBayes program v0.9.21-7-g7dd41db (65). The variants are then quality ﬁltered, 3
and a ”core” set of SNP variants (deﬁned as those SNPs with sufﬁcient sequencing coverage for the O)
genomic location for all isolates) are extracted from the data using Snippy. A custom python script 2-
(https://github.com/nextgenusfs/genome_scripts/blob/master/snippy2tree.py) was used to convert the (Q
SNP data to binary format, and a maximum likelihood phylogeny was inferred using RAxML v8.2.8 (66) C
with 1,000 bootstrap replicates. Snippy variant call ﬁles (VCF) from CEA10, ISSFT-021, and |F1SW-F4 were 8
imported into CLC Genomics Workbench v9.01, and the variants were ﬁltered and annotated based on """"
overlap with secondary metabolite gene cluster predictions (34). To determine which variants would
result in nonsynonymous changes to coding genes, the variants were annotated using the Amino Acid
Changes module of CLC Genomics Workbench.
Fungal culture. After initial isolation on PDA plates, all A. fumigatus strains were grown on solid
glucose minimal medium at 37°C, unless otherwise noted, for conidial preparation, physiological analysis,
and stress tests. Conidial preparations for in vitro analyses were harvested after approximately 72 h with
sterile 0.01% Tween—water and gentle agitation with an L-shaped spreader before being passed through
a double layer of sterile mica cloth into a 50-ml screw-cap tube. Conidia were enumerated with a
hemocytometer before adjustment to various concentrations as needed. Original spore suspensions
maintained as glycerol stocks were stored at — 80°C.
Physiological analysis. All GMM plates for physiological analysis and stress testing were measured
to contain 25 ml. For radial growth assessment, 1 X 104 conidia in a volume of 10 Ml were centrally
inoculated onto GMM plates. Radial growth was measured daily at the time points indicated. For spore
germination rate assays, 100 ml of liquid GMM was inoculated with 5 X 106 spores/ml and grown at 37°C
and 250 rpm. At 2, 4, 6, and 8 h, 1-ml samples were drawn, pelleted in a tabletop centrifuge for 1 min
at maximum rpm and resuspended in a ﬁnal volume of 100 Ml to concentrate spores and germlings for
facile enumeration. As germlings can clump, clouding clear counts, each sample was brieﬂy sonicated in

a water bath for 10 5. One hundred cells per condition were counted and scored. A spore was considered
germinated when the germ tube diameter was greater than or equal to the diameter ofthe swollen base.
Stress tests. Radial growth was assayed as described above but after supplementation with various
stressors. Concentrations for stress chemicals were as follows: 1 M NaCl, 4 MM menadione, 25 Mg/ml
Congo red, and 0.01% methyl methanesulfonate. For assessment of H202 sensitivity, it is easier to obtain
consistent results by using a modiﬁed diffusion assay (33) over direct medium supplementation, as done
for the stressors listed above. Brieﬂy, spores were evenly suspended in 55°C GMM while still liquid at a
ﬁnal count 1.5 X 104 per 25-ml plate. Following solidiﬁcation of the agar, a 1-cm circular core was
removed from the center of each plate, and the resulting hole was inoculated with 100 pl of 4% H202.
Zones of inhibition were measured after 48 h.
Secondary metabolite extraction and analysis. Fungal isolates were cultivated at 30°C on GMM
agar plates (6 g/liter NaNO3, 0.52 g/liter KCI, 0.52 g/liter MgSO4-7HZO, 1.52 g/liter KHZPO4, 10 g/liter
D-glucose, 15 g/liter agar supplemented with 1 ml/liter of trace elements) at 10 X 106 spores/pJ per plate
(10 cm). After 5 days, agar was chopped into small pieces and extracted with 25 ml methanol (MeOH),
followed by 1-h sonication and ﬁltration. Extraction and sonication steps were repeated with 25 ml of 1:1
MeOH-dichloromethane. After a second ﬁltration, combined crude extracts of each isolate were evap- g
orated in vacuo to yield a residue that was then suspended in 25 ml of water and partitioned with ethanol E
acetate (EtOAc; 25 ml). The EtOAc layer was evaporated in vacuo, redissolved in 2 ml of 20% dimethyl 2
sulfoxide—MeOH, and 10 MI was examined by HPLC-DAD-MS analysis. HPLC-MS was carried out using a 8
ThermoFinnigan LCQ Advantage ion trap mass spectrometer with a reverse-phase C18 column (3 pm; 2.1 Q-
by 100 Mm; Alltech Prevail) at a ﬂow rate of 125 pJ/min. The solvent gradient for LC/MS was 95% 8
MeCN—HZO (solvent B) in 5% MeCN—HZO (solvent A), both of which contained 0.05% formic acid, as :h
follows: 0% solvent B from 0 to 5 min, 0 to 100% solvent B from 5 min to 35 min, 100% solvent B from O
35 to 40 min, 100 to 0% solvent B from 40 to 45 min, and reequilibration with 0% solvent B from 45 to 3
50 min. 3
Zebraﬁsh care and maintenance. Adult zebraﬁsh were reared as described previously (39). Brieﬂy, 6
adults were maintained on a dedicated aquatic system and exposed to a light/dark cycle of 14 h and Q
10 h, respectively, and fed twice daily. After spawning, embryos were collected in E3 buffer and stored 3
at 285°C. Methelyne blue, an ingredient of E3 buffer that inhibits fungal growth, was omitted from E3 %
buffer (E3-MB) at 24 h postfertilization. All larval zebraﬁsh procedures and adult husbandry were 3'
performed in compliance with NIH guidelines and approved by the University of Wisconsin—Madison £2
Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee. CD
Larval zebraﬁsh virulence assay. Virulence assays were performed using the larval zebraﬁsh model 8
of invasive aspergillosis as described previously (39) with slight modiﬁcations. Larval immune suppres- 3
sion was obtained genetically through the use of transgenic mpx:mCherry—2A-Rac2D57N larvae (41). Prior 0
to infection, larvae were screened and selected for mCherry expression in neutrophils to identify (i
individuals harboring the dominant negative allele. Brieﬂy, hindbrain ventricle infections were performed 0
at 48-h postfertilization, versus 36 h postfertilization, as originally reported. Brieﬂy, conidial stocks in PBS :5
at a concentration of 1.5 X 108 conidia/ml were mixed 2:1 with 1% phenol red to 1.0 X 108 conidia/ml Z
to visualize injection success. Larvae were anesthetized in E3-MB supplemented with 0.2 nM tricaine 2
(ethyl 3-aminobenzoate; Sigma-Aldrich) prior to microinjection of 3 nl spore suspension or PBS vehicle CD
control into the hindbrain ventricle through the otic vesicle. Following microinjection, larvae were rinsed 3
several times to remove anesthetic and housed individually in wells of a 96-well plate in ~100 Ml E3-MB. g
Survival of individual larvae was scored daily using loss of heartbeat as the readout for mortality. ""
Statistical analysis. In order to compare differences in SM production between isolates, the area a
under the electrospray ionization curve (ESI) was integrated for each compound. SM data collected from ""
three independent biological replicates were used for statistical analysis. Ordinary one-way analysis of B
variance (ANOVA) was conducted to compare the level of production of seven identiﬁed SMs between a
Af293 (treated as a control) and CEA10, |SSFT-021, and |F1SW-F4. The data are presented as column 0'
charts with corresponding error bars. Data analysis was conducted using GraphPad Prism version 7. <
Survival analysis for larval zebraﬁsh infection experiments was performed as previously described (39) by (Q
pooling experimental replicates and generating P values via Cox proportional hazards regression g
analysis. g
