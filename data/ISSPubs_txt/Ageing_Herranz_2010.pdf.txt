Abstract

Genome-wide transcriptional profiling shows that reducing gravity levels during

Drosophila metamorphosis in the International Space Station (188) causes important

alterations in gene expression: a large set of differentially expressed genes (DEGs) are

observed compared to lg controls. However, the preparation procedures for spaceflight

and the nonideal environmental conditions on board the ISS subject the organisms to

additional environmental stresses that demonstrably affect gene expression. Simulated

microgravity experiments performed on the ground, under ideal conditions for the flies,

using the random position machine (RPM), show much more subtle effects on gene

expression. However, when the ground experiments are repeated under conditions

designed to reproduce the additional environmental stresses imposed by spaceflight

procedures, 79% of the DEGs detected in the 188 are reproduced by the RPM experiment.

Gene ontology analysis of them shows they are genes that affect respiratory activity,

developmental processes and stress-related changes. Here, we analyse the effects of

microgravity on gene expression in relation to the environmental stresses imposed by

spaceflight. Analysis using ’gene expression dynamics inspector’ (GEDI) self-organizing

maps reveals a subtle response of the transeriptome to microgravity. Remarkably,

hypergravity simulation induces similar response of the transeriptome, but in the

opposite direction, i.e. the genes promoted under microgravity are usually suppressed

under hypergravity. These results suggest that the transeriptome is finely tuned to

normal gravity and that microgravity, together with environmental constraints associated

with space experiments, can have profound effects on gene expression.
