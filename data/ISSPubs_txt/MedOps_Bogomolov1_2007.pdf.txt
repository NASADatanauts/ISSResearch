Abstract

The main purpose of the medical support system aboard International Space Station (188) is crew health maintenance and
high level of work capability assurance prior to during and after in space ﬂights. In the present communication the Russian point
of View dealing With the problems and achievements in this branch is presented. An overview on medical operations during
ﬂight and after ﬁnalization of the space missions based on Russian data of crew health and environment state monitoring, as
well as data on the inﬂight countermeasures (prophylaxis) jointly With data on operational problems that are speciﬁc to 188 is
presented. The report summarizes results of the medical examination of Russian members of the ISS and taXi crews during and
after Visits to the 188.
