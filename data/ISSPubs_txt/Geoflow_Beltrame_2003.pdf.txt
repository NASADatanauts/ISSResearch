ABSTRACT
Codimension 2 bifurcatiOn of convective patterns in the nonrotating spherical Bénard Problem of Boussinesq
fluid is studied using center manifold reduction. The aim is to determine, in the GEOFLOW—experiment

theicritical aspect ratio and Rayleigh number corresponding to the (E, 2’ + 1) mode interaction. In the case
of the (2, 3) interaction, the), existence of heteroclinic cycles are examined versus the Prandtl number.

INTRODUCTION ’

The bifurcation theory with symmetry is a powerful tool in the spherical Bénard problem, in which the
near-onset conVection in a self-gravity spherical shell of ﬂuid is considered. In this problem, there are two
natural bifurcation parameters: one is the Rayleigh number R, which is proportional to the buoyancy force
responsible for the onset of convection; the second one is the aspect ratio 77 which is the ratio of the inner to _
the outer radius of the shell. When the Rayleigh number is increasing the “trivial” solution loses its stability.
Generically, a unique spherical mode 2 is unstable (codimension 1, only Ra is allowed to vary). In this case,
we expect only stationary or travelling waves solutions (Gaeta and Rossi, 1984). For speciﬁc aspect ratio
numbers nc, two modes (2,2 + 1) are unstable (codimension 2, Ra and n vary). For this mode interaction
the dynamics are more complex. It is already known since the article of Guckenheimer and Holmes (1988)

. that structurally stable heteroclinic cycles between group orbits of equilibria (i.e. steady states) can arise
due to the symmetry of the problem. The (1,2) interaction was studied from a numerical point of view by
Firiedrich and Haken (1986) and later by Armbruster and Chossat (1991) using group theoritic methods. A
general study of the (B, E + 1) interaction was presented in Chossat and Guyard (1996). The authors show,
under certain “generic” conditions, that heteroclinic cycles of various types exist and these connections
are “robust” against small perturbation. Finally, Chossat (1999) has been proved that a heteroclinic cycle
persists when the system is.slowly rotating around an axis. In this case, not only steady-states but time
periodic ﬂows with the form of rotating waves are connected by heteroclinic orbits.

' The GEOFLOW-experiment on ISS is an opportunity to ﬁnd such intermittent-like behavior dynamics

and thereby to corroborate the theory. But it has two speciﬁcities Campared to the previous studies: -

o The simulated central force ﬁeld (dielectrophoretic force ﬁeld) differs from the gravity ﬁeld. Indeed,
the gravity and buoyancy forces have the same mathematical form and then degeneracy occurs in
the bifurcation equations. In particularly, the existence of heteroclinic cycles is proved only in the
degeneracy case neighborhood (Chossat and Guyard, 1996). -

o The presence of a thin conductor wire inside the shell (which is needed to control the potential of the
inner sphere). This Wire is breaking the symmetry of the problem and could play a relevant role on
bifurcations.

In this present work, the problem has the spherical O(3)-symmetry, i.e., there is not rotation and we
neglect the inﬂuence of the wire. The aim of this paper is to determine 'if the degeneracy conditions could
be satisfy with the experiment requirements. After a brief description of the model, we compute by a linear
study the critical values of the both parameters Ra and n in order to obtain a mode interaction. Then, the
bifurcation equations of the (2,3) interaction are presented and the method of the bifurcation coefﬁcients
computation is described. Finally, we present the variations of these coefﬁcients versus the Prandtl number.
GENERAL FRAMEWORK . . . l- ..

The governing equations for perturbations {I of the velocity ﬁeld of the ﬂuid. and 8 of the temperature
ﬁeld are set in the Boussinesq approximation. They are given, after a suitable nondimensionalization, by

The functions 9*(7‘) : £5 and h*(r) = f3 are respectively the dimensional less central force and the
temperature gradient. The system of equations (1) is deﬁned in the domain
' Q={(T16)¢)ln<r<1}i
where 17 is the aspect ratio. The ﬂuid is viscous, then we consider “rigid boundaries”: 17' = 6 on 09 and the
temperature is imposed on boundaries: 9 = 0 on 89.

We develop each solution (6,8) in the generalized spherical harmonics (Chossat and Giraud, 1983):

The spherical functions Tim are known by a recursive relation and they are determined by a formal com-
puting. - ' ' '

Remark: We do not have use toroidal and poloidal decomposition, as in Friedrich and Haken (1986),
because we need to differentiate the scalar potential to obtain the velocity ﬁeld. This derivation is a source
of numerical errors. Furthermore, this decomposition occurs only for an'incompressible ﬂuid.

LINEAR STABILITY _

The pure conductive solution becomes unstable when the Rayleigh number increases (i.e. A). The
instability arises when the linearized system (1) has a. zero eigenvalue. Due to the spherical symmetry, we
obtain an ordinary differential system with the unique variable 7' for each mode 3. Furthermore, it does not

depend on the m indice. The radial functions, i.e. afn(r), are discretized thanks the Chebychev polynomials
(“pseudo—spectral” method, Funaro, 1992). The eigenvalues problem is solved by an Arnoldi method (see
6.5;. Laure, 2000). ' - .

For each mode EC corresponds a critical Value Ac. This critical mode depends on the aspect ratio 17.
We can prove that 8c tends to inﬁnity when 1] tends to 1 (Chossat, 1979). Then, the 86(1)) is an increasing
function. The ﬁgure 1 shows the function €c(n) for EC 5 6. We remark that for some Values of the ratio
aspect, two modes co-exist. In particularly, for no E 0.33 the interaction (2,3) holds (Figure 1). The
interaction (1,2) can be not reached experimentally, because it appears for n < 0.3.
Let us now consider the bifurcation situation for the critical values Ac 2 19.8 and 776 = 0.333 corre-
spending to the (2,3) mode interaction.

These equations keep the 0(3) symmetry of Eq. (1), and therefore have a certain equivariant structure.

RESULTS
I In order to obtain the “pure” solutions a: = i1 #421 and y 2 dz‘ /—§2§, it is necessary that:
o a close to zero,
o 611 < 0 and 622 < 0.
P‘iirthermore, in order to obtain the existence for heterocline cycles, it is required that
I bc > 0.
All these conditions are satisﬁed if 9* x h*. It is not our case thus we have to compute numerically these
coefﬁcients. _

The coefﬁcients are shown in Figures 2 and 3 as a function of the Prandtl number ”Pr (—3 < logPT < 4).
The cubic coefﬁcients 611 and 622 are negative for all values of 79¢. The quadratic coefﬁcient a has the
same order that cubic coefﬁcients for the range P, < 10‘1. Otherwise, a is negligible. And a vanishes for
73,. § 0.237 and changes its sign. The coefﬁcient b holds the same sign for all Prandtl values. On the other
hand, 0 changes its sign for Prandtl close to the unity. So, for ’PT > 1, the product be is negative, we cannot
ﬁnd cycles. .

Hence, the value Pr = 0.237 is very interesting because a is close to zero and the requirements of
heterocline cycles existence are satisﬁed. We give in Table l the coefﬁcients values for this case.

A second interesting point is the degeneracy case for Pr =2 0.95 for which c = 0. The dynamic issues
from this bifurcation is poorly known. A recent study for the interaction (1,2) has been treated by Porter
and Knobloch (2001).
