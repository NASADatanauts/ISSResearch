Abstract
The Objective of the “DOsimetry 0f BIOlogical EXperiments in SPace” (DOBIES) project is to develop a standard dosimetric method as
a combination of different techniques to estimate absorbed dose, dose equivalent, and linear energy transfer (LET) spectrum in biological
samples in space experiments. The detectors investigated in the project include various types of thermoluminescence detectors (TLDs), such as
LiF:Mg,Ti, LiF:Mg,Cu,P, CaSO4sz, as well as A1203zC used as TLD and Optically stimulated luminescence detectors (OSLDs), and track-
etch detectors (TED). This paper describes the DOBIES project and reports preliminary results Obtained during the BASE-A experiment carried
out at the International Space Station (188) in September, 2006. The results are compared to data from previous space exposures carried out
by the members of the DOBIES project.
