Abstract
Hormonal changes in humans during spaceflight have been demonstrated but the underlying mechanisms are still
unknown. To clarify this point thyroid and testis/epididymis, both regulated by anterior pituitary gland, have been analyzed
on long-term space-exposed male C57BL/10 mice, either wild type or pleiotrophin transgenic, overexpressing osteoblast
stimulating factor-1. Glands were submitted to morphological and functional analysis. In thyroids, volumetric ratios
between thyrocytes and colloid were measured. CAMP production in 10—7M and 10—8M thyrotropin-treated samples was
studied. Thyrotropin receptor and caveolin-1 were quantitized by immunoblotting and localized by immunofluorescence. |n
space-exposed animals, both basal and thyrotropin-stimulated CAMP production were always higher. Also, the structure of
thyroid follicles appeared more organized, while thyrotropin receptor and caveolin-1 were overexpressed. Unlike the control
samples, in the space samples thyrotropin receptor and caveolin-1 were both observed at the intracellular junctions,
suggesting their interaction in specific cell membrane microdomains. |n testes, immunofluorescent reaction for 36- steroid
dehydrogenase was performed and the relative expressions of hormone receptors and interleukin-1B were quantified by
RT—PCR. Epididymal sperm number was counted. |n space-exposed animals, the presence of 3B and 17B steroid
dehydrogenase was reduced. Also, the expression of androgen and follicle stimulating hormone receptors increased while
lutenizing hormone receptor levels were not affected. The interleukin 1 [3 expression was upregulated. The tubular
architecture was altered and the sperm cell number was significantly reduced in spaceflight mouse epididymis (approx.
—90% vs. laboratory and ground controls), indicating that the space environment may lead to degenerative changes in
seminiferous tubules. Space-induced changes of structure and function of thyroid and testis/epididymis could be
responsible for variations of hormone levels in human during space missions. More research, hopefully a reflight of MDS,
would be needed to establish whether the space environment acts directly on the peripheral glands or induces changes in
the hypotalamus-pituitary-glandular axis.
