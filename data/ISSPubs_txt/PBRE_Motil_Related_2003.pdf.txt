Experimental data on ﬂow pattern transitions, pressure drop, and ﬂow characteristics
for cocarrent gas—liqaid ﬂow through packed columns in microgravity is analyzed. The
pulse ﬂow regime exists over a wider range ofgas and liquid ﬂow rates under micrograv-
ity conditions. Furthermore, maps used to predict transition boundaries in normal grav-
ity do not apply in microgravity. The ﬂow regime data are compared to the widely used
Talmor map and a new transition criterion between bubble and pulse ﬂow in micrograv-
ity is proposed. The pressure-drop data clearly show that interfacial eﬁects can increase
the pressure drop by as much as 300% compared to those predicted by the single-phase
Ergan equation. A two-phase friction factor is correlated to the superﬁcial gas and
liquid Reynolds numbers and the Saratman number. New data are also presented on
the inﬂuence of gravity on the pulse amplitude and frequency.
