How gravity inﬂuences the growth form and ﬂavor components of plants is of interest to the space program because plants could
be used for food and life support during prolonged missions away from the planet,' where that constant feature of Earth’s environ-
ment does not prevail. We used plant growth hardware from prior experiments on the space shuttle to grow Brassica rapa and Ara-

"" bidopsis thaliana plants during 16-d or ll-d hypergravity treatments on large—diameter centrifuge rotors. Both species showed

radical changes in growth form, becoming more prostrate with increasing g-loads (2—g and 4-g). In Brassica, height decreased and

' stems thickened in a linear relationship with increasing g—load. Glucosinolates, secondary compounds that contribute ﬂavor to

Brassica, decreased by 140% over the range of micro to 4-g, while the structural secondary compound, lignin, remained constant
at ~15% (w/w) cell wall dry mass. Stem thickening at 4—g was associated with substantial increases in cell size (47%, 226%, and

‘ 33% for pith, cortex, and vascular tissue), rather than any change in cell number. The results, which demonstrate the profound

effect of gravity on plant growth form and secondary metabolism, are discussed in the context of similar thigmostresses such as
touch and wind.
