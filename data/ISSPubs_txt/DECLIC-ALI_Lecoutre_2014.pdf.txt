Abstract
Boiling phenomena in the tWO—phase region of SF6 close to its critical point have been observed using the
high—quality thermal and optical environment of the CNES dedicated facility ALI—DECLIC on board the
International Space Station (188). The weightlessness environment of the ﬂuid, Which cancels buoyancy
forces and favorizes the three—dimensional spherical shape of the gas bubble, is proven to be an irreplaceable
powerful tool for boiling studies. To identify each key mechanism of the boiling phenomena, the ALI—
DECLIC experiments have beneﬁted from i) the well—adapted design of the test cells, ii) the high—ﬁdelity of
the ALI insert teleoperation When long—duration experiment in stable thermal and microgravity environment
are required and iii) the high repeatability of the controlled thermal disturbances. These key mechanisms
were observed by light transmission and interferometry technique independently With two sample cells ﬁlled
With pure SF6 at a near—critical density. The ﬂuid samples are driven away from thermal equilibrium by
using a heater directly implemented in the ﬂuid, or a surface heater on a sapphire optical Window. In
the interferometry cell, the bulk massive heater distinguishes two symmetrical tWO—phase domains. The
modiﬁcation of the gas bubble shape is observed during heating. In the direct observation cell, the gas
bubble is separated by a liquid ﬁlm from the thin layered transparent heater deposited on the sapphire
window. The liquid ﬁlm drying and the triple contact line motion during heating are observed using light
transmission. The experiments have been performed in a temperature range of 10K below the critical
temperature TC, With special attention to the range 0.1 mK g TC — T g 3 mK very close to the critical
temperature. The unique advantage of this investigation is to provide opportunities to observe the boiling
phenomena at very low heat ﬂuxes, thanks to the ﬁne adjustment of the liquid—vapor properties, (e.g. surface
tension), by precise control of the distance to the critical point. We present the new observations of the
gas bubble spreading over the heating surface Which characterizes the regime Where vapor bubbles nucleate
separately and grow, as well as liquid drying, vapor ﬁlm formation, triple contact line motion, which are
the key mechanisms at the origin of the boiling crisis When the formed vapor ﬁlm reduces the heat transfer
drastically at the heater wall.
