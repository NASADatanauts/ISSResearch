The strategy of space simulation experiments are shown in the top panel of this figure; (A) The C-ion exposure in the first step
is assumed to correspond to the IR exposure in space and the later steps are designed to determine the repair efficiencies of
DNA double strand breaks (DSBs), introduced by the I-Scel expression vector. The repair of DSBs is considered to be mainly
due to two pathways shown in the bottom panel, non homologous end-joining (NHEJ) and homologous recombination (HR). As
a principle for determination of DSB repair efficiency, we measure the TK' mutants generated through NHEJ or TK+ revertants
generated through HR, respectively. The representative data obtained with this system is shown in the inserted table.
