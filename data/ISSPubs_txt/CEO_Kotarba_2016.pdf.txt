0L5 information about the degree of imperviousness for individual pixels (:1: 20% errors); nevertheless it accurately
estimated the spatially—averaged degree of imperviousness for the whole study area (30.2% vs. the reference
value of 30.1%). These results show that [55 photography is an important source of nighttime imagery for
mapping the extent of impervious surfaces, and represents a considerable improvement over OLS capabilities.

The difference between ISS-based and HRL—I classiﬁcations (shown as C, D, and E) are added for reference; this is based on OLS data (E1vidge,Tuttle, et al., 2007). See Section 4 for a
discussion of this dataset. For A, B and D the threshold between pervious and impervious surfaces was set to soil sealing greater than 0%. The OLS overestimation seen in D is partially
corrected if the threshold is changed to > 10% (E).
