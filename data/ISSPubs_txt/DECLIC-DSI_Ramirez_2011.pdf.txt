Abstract. Dynamical microstructure formation and selection during solidification processing,
which has a major inﬂuence on the properties in the use of elaborated materials, occur during
the growth process. In situ observation of the solid—liquid interface morphology evolution is
thus necessary. On earth, convection effects dominate in bulk samples and may strongly
interact with microstructure dynamics and alter pattern Characterization. Series of solidification
experiments with 3D cylindrical sample geometry were conducted in succinonitrile (SCN) —
0.24 wt%camph0r (model transparent system), in microgravity environment in the Directional
Solidification Insert 0f the DECLIC facility of CNES (French space agency) on the
International Space Station (ISS). Micrograyity enabled homogeneous values of control
parameters over the whole interface allowing the obtaining of homogeneous patterns suitable
to get quantitative benchmark data. First analyses of the Characteristics of the pattern (spacing,
order, etc.) and of its dynamics in microgravity will be presented.
1. Introduction
The study of solidification microstructure formation and selection, if any, is very important in the
engineering and processing of advanced new materials [1]. The interface patterns formed by
solidification largely govern mechanical and physical properties of materials. The two most typical
microstructures are cells and dendrites, and their characteristics profoundly inﬂuence the properties of
a wide range of commercial metallic alloys. The correlation between microstructure and processing
conditions can be best examined by directional solidification in which all experimental parameters can
be accurately and independently controlled.
The evolution of the spatial pattern of cells or dendrites occurs under dynamic conditions of growth in
which the forming pattern reorganizes into a rather periodic array so that in situ and real time
observation of the solid—liquid interface is a precious tool to get a detailed knowledge of the entire
time—evolution 0f the interface pattern. This explains the very extensive use of transparent organic

analogs that behave like metallic alloys regarding solidification but are transparent to Visible light so
that classical optical techniques are sufficient for their observation [2].

A major impediment in the study of three—dimensional pattern evolution in ground—based studies is
the strong inﬂuence of convection on cellular and dendritic patterns. Extensive ground—based studies
carried out in metallic and organic bulk samples have clearly established that ﬂuid flow modifies the
structure of the solute boundary layer that inﬂuences the pattern development [3, 4]. Directional
solidification experiments under low gravity conditions provide a unique setting to investigate
microstructure development in spatially extended sample geometries with negligible convection and
under well—controlled conditions of growth rate, temperature gradient and alloy composition.
Consequently, those experiments timely provide unique benchmark data to validate the predictions of
theoretical and computational models with purely diffusive growth regime. The study presented here
was thus conducted using the Directional Solidification Insert (DSI) dedicated to in situ and real time
characterization of the dynamical selection of the solid—liquid interface morphology in BULK samples
of transparent materials, which was developed by the French Space Agency (CNES) in the frame of
the DECLIC project (Dispositif pour l'Etude de la Croissance et des Liquides Critiques). The DECLIC
facility of CNES was launched with 17—A shuttle ﬂight (August 2009) as part of a joint NASA/CNES
research program and is installed on the International Space Station in microgravity environment. The
main instrument monitoring is made from the CADMOS center, the French User Support and
Operation Centre (USOC) in Toulouse. Taking advantage of provided tele—science capabilities,
scientists have the possibility to follow in near real—time conditions and to remotely control
experiments. The commissioning of the D81 was realized in December 2009 and siX runs of two to
three weeks each were performed from April 2010 to April 2011.

After a brief description of the experimental procedure and methods of analysis of images, results
will be described and discussed in terms of pattern formation and evolution.

2. Experimental procedure

The DECLIC—DSI insert mainly contains 2 elements: the Bridgman furnace and the experimental
cartridge. Complete descriptions of DECLIC and its inserts can be found in [5—6].

The experimental cartridge includes the quartz crucible and a system of volume compensation made of
stainless steel that is useful to accommodate the specimen volume variations associated to phase
changes. The cylindrical crucible has an inner diameter of ten millimeters and a length that enables
about ten centimeters solidification, thus allowing the study of the whole development of extended 3D
patterns from the initial stage to the steady state. The crucible is equipped with a flat glass window at
the bottom and a lens immersed in the melt at the top. The main observation mode (Axial observation)
takes advantage of the complete aXial transparency of the cartridge provided by these last two
elements: the light coming from LEDs passes through the cartridge from the bottom to the top,
therefore crossing the interface. The optical imaging system formed by the immersed lens and a
following relay lens forms the image of the interface on a CCD camera. On the same cartridge aXis, an
interferometer is also set but it will not be detailed here (more information on its use can be found in
[7]). The interface can also be observed from the side (Transverse observation).

In this study, we used a Succinonitrile (SCN) — 0.24 wt% Camphor alloy. For filling the crucible,
SCN purified by NASA by both distillation and zone melting was used. The alloy was then prepared
by adding the solute. All procedures for sample preparation were carefully realized under vacuum to
avoid humidity contamination. Once sealed, the cartridge was inserted inside the Bridgman furnace.

A thermal gradient ranging from 10 to 30 Kem‘1 is imposed by regulated hot and cold zones,
respectively, located above and below the adiabatic area where the interface is positioned. Upward
solidification is achieved by pulling the crucible down into the cold zone of the furnace at a rate
ranging from 0.1 to 30 ym/s. For a defined alloy concentration, varying the thermal gradient or more
conveniently, the pulling rate, leads to the development of various interface morphologies, ranging
from planar front (high gradient — low pulling rate) to cellular and finally dendritic pattern (low

gradient — high pulling rate). In the experiments detailed here, the thermal gradient is set to 28 K/crn
and pulling velocities range from 0.5 to 12 ym/s.

3. Analysis methods

In situ and continuous observation leads to a huge amount of images so that adequate and as
systematic as possible procedures had to be developed and validated to extract relevant quantitative
data. Quantitative characterization of the patterns consists in measuring the evolution, as a function of
time and growth parameters, of the parameters that describe the interface morphology, such as the
primary spacing, order/disorder level of pattern, 3D—shape, tip radius, etc. Concerning shape of
structures and tip radius, measurements are based on interferometric analysis that is not described
here, as the data required to perform these analyses are not yet available (data stored on hard—disk still
on 188). For more information on shape reconstruction by interferometric analysis in DECLIC—DSI,
one may refer to Bergeon et al. [7].

Image treatment and analysis procedures have been developed on Visilog® Image Analysis
Software (Noesis, France) to facilitate exploitation of results. The first step is to obtain a binary image
that is then used as an input for specific procedures dedicated to the determination of the primary
spacing distribution and the characterization of the pattern order/disorder and type (Minimal Spanning
Tree analysis [8, 9] and number of first neighbors [9]). In this article, analyzes are limited to
characterization of primary spacing evolution. Primary spacing can be considered as the center—to—
center distance between two neighboring cells. Its determination requires beforehand cell detection
and identification. Each cell center is then determined together With the identification of the first
neighbors so that center—to—center distances can be calculated. The spacing histogram is then drawn to
determine the average spacing and the standard deviation.

4. Results

Figure 1 illustrates the microstructures obtained for pulling rates ranging from 0.5 ym/s to 12 ym/s. In
all cases, the pictures correspond to the interface microstructure after about 40 mm of growth. The
microstructure is clearly cellular With large spacing at low pulling rate, for example at 0.5 ym/s (figure
1(a)) 0r 2 ym/s (figure 1(b)) but the deep cells observed at 4 ym/s (figure 1(0)) become dendritic
(sharpening 0f the tips, anisotropy of the tip shape) at 8 ym/s as observed on the zooms of figure 1(d)
and 1(e). The spacing obviously decreases when the pulling rate increases and this decrease is faster at
low pulling rates.

The initial stages of microstructure formation are more or less the same Whatever the pulling rate.
This is here described on the basis of the experiment at VP = 4 ym/s. The starting interface
corresponds to VP = 0 (figure 2(a)). After triggering the pulling, morphological instability initiates by
forming linear ridges along sub—boundaries that finally underline a rather complex array (figure 2(b)).
Between these defects, in interface areas that are still smooth, sorne poxes may be present: they can be
described as circular undulations 0f the interface. Ridges underlining sub—grain boundaries
progressively emit new ridges in their transverse direction and simultaneously, a quite uniform
corrugation that corresponds to the initial Visible wavelength of morphological instability invades the
interface (figure 2(0)). The amplitude of all these interface modulations starts to increase, channels are
forming but it is still difficult to identify cells (figure 2(d)). At this stage, the interface dynamics is
extremely fast and pattern disorder high. There is then a progressive decrease of disorder and a clear
pattern of cells is eventually reached (figure 2(e)). The dynamics then clearly slows down and is
limited to progressive size adjustment and array ordering (figure 2(f)).

The evolution of spacing was measured as a function of time for each pulling rate. Two examples
of such data are given on figure 3, for VP = 1 ym/s and VP = 4 ym/s. Figure 3(a) corresponds to the
spacing variation as a function of solidified length. In the very beginning of microstructure formation,
it is not possible to determine the spacing With center—to—center methods, as microstructure does not
form closed cells (figures 2(c) and 2(d) for example). So the three first measurements are performed
using a FFT (Fast Fourier Transform) based method.

At low pulling velocity (for example 1 ym/s), the spacing progressively increases to reach its steady—
state value; size adjustment is performed by cell elimination. At higher velocity (for example 4 ym/s),
the spacing variation presents an overgrowth at the beginning of solidification before a slow decrease
to reach the steady—state value. This dynamics is consistent with previous observations on thin samples
of succinonitrile—based alloys, for example by Seetharaman et a1. [10], but the mechanism of spacing
adjustment still needs to be Clarified in our case. Usually, spacing adjustment is considered to occur by
tip splitting for but this does not occur frequently enough here to explain the magnitude of decrease.
The existence of another spacing adjustment mechanism was mentioned by Han et a1. [11], who
observed significant lateral motion of dendrites when a significant perturbation is present in the
system. In their case, this perturbation was a tertiary branch of a dendrite growing to become a
primary. The disturbance in spacing then propagates through the whole pattern and helps for a fine
adjustment of spacing. In our case, the physical mechanism generating new cells still needs to be
identified. Either some disturbance or the macroscopic concavity 0f the interface could be of major
importance in array dynamics. Indeed, Weiss et a1. [12] described the drifting of a cellular pattern
along a concave interface where new cells keep forming at the top of the slope and drift towards the
center where most of them disappear by overgrowth. Further analyses are in progress to validate such
hypothesis.

Figure 3(b) presents the evolution of the “selection factor“ SF as a function of the solidified length:
SF 2 Ak/kav with lav, the average value of spacing and Al, the corresponding standard deviation
extracted from the histograms of spacing. This selection factor reﬂects the sharpness of selection.
Whatever the pulling rate, it is worth noting that the spacing selection is weak as the selection factor
ranges from 0.13 (i.e. :13% from the average value) to 0.20 but it appears that this selection tends to
be stronger when pulling rate increases. The weak selection at low pulling rate is associated to high
disorder, illustrated for example on figure 1(a) for VP = 0.5 ym/s.

5. Conclusion

In this article, we presented some of the very first results obtained in microgravity using the

Directional Solidification Insert 0f the DECLIC facility on board ISS. The quality of the experimental

system that provides very clear images of the interfacial microstructure during its Whole evolution has

been demonstrated. Microgravity environment provided the conditions to get quantitative benchmark
data: homogeneous patterns corresponding to homogeneous values of control parameters along the

Whole interface were obtained. Long solidifications have been performed to get the Whole dynamics

and mechanisms of microstructure formation or change, spacing adjustment, pattern ordering, etc.

These data are currently under treatment. The limited analyzes presented here ask many questions that

require comprehensive and systematic measurements, presently in progress, especially concerning the

process of spacing adjustment.

Simultaneously, similar ground experiments on thin samples are performed to extract the
dimensionality inﬂuence on both mechanisms and shape characteristics. Lastly, numerical 3D phase—
field modelings are also currently starting for further analysis and comparison.
