Abstract
Coat protein complex I (COPI) and COPII are required for bidirectional membrane trafﬁcking
Z between the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and the Golgi. While these core coat machineries and
E other transport factors are highly conserved across species, high-resolution imaging studies
""'0 indicate that the organization of the ER—Golgi interface is varied in eukaryotic cells. Regulation of
> COPII assembly, in some cases to manage distinct cellular cargo, is emerging as one important
5 component in determining this structure. Comparison of the ER—Golgi interface across different
8' systems, particularly mammalian and plant cells, reveals fundamental elements and distinct
% organization of this interface. A better understanding of how these interfaces are regulated to meet
% varying cellular secretory demands should provide key insights into the mechanisms that control
% efﬁcient trafﬁcking of proteins and lipids through the secretory pathway.

E- The secretory pathway in eukaryotic cells is responsible for biogenesis and proper
intracellular distribution of a Wide range of proteins, complex carbohydrates and lipids.
Trafﬁcking in the secretory pathway is highly dynamic and responsive to speciﬁc cellular
functional demands. Forward transport (also known as anterograde transport) of newly
synthesized proteins and lipids is initiated at the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and, as such,
Z ER-to-Golgi transport represents a Vital gateway to the endomembrane system.

"""" in vivo was demonstrated through experiments using brefeldin A (BFA) in which the
addition of the drug allowed Golgi-speciﬁc oligosaccharide modiﬁcation of ER—retained
vesicular stomatitis Virus G—protein131. The results were interpreted as a consequence of a
redistribution of resident Golgi proteins to the ER. In accordance with this hypothesis,
reversible BFA—induced disruption of the Golgi has been observed in microscopy

Z studies132=133. It is now established that primary targets of BFA are ARF GEFs, such as

E GBFl in mammalian cells134=135. BFA stabilizes the interaction of inactive ARFs with

'IU their GEFs136 as well as ARF GEF binding to Golgi Inernbranes134, which in turn

E route depends tightly 0n the homeostasis of the retrograde pathway, which ensures not

8- only the retrieval of resident proteins that escape the ER but also facilitates the recycling

E In this Review, we discuss how the ER—Golgi interface and COPII-mediated trafﬁcking
varies in different species. We focus on the plant and mammalian systems as exquisite
examples of how divergent adaptation of common components of the trafﬁcking system has
allowed the unique needs of differentiated eukaryotic cell types to be met. Ultimately, a

3): The ER and Golgi: partners in secretion

§ The ER is responsible for initiating the synthesis, folding and quality control, as well as

9-; priming the glycosylation, of a large part Of the cellular proteome. It has a unique

9:) architecture that is characterized by a network of interconnected membrane tubules and

2 sheets that form closed polygons. Most proteins that have been synthesized in the ER are

8 transported to the Golgi during their biogenesis. The Golgi has several fundamental cellular

%' roles. First, it functions as a central platform for connecting anterograde and retrograde

H- protein ﬂow within the secretory pathway3. Second, it serves as a complex carbohydrate
‘factory’ that supplies the material needed to build the plant cell wall and the glycoprotein

matrix surrounding animal cells, as well as the donor groups for glycosylation of many
proteins and lipids4_10. Last, the Golgi also provides a membrane scaffold for the dynamic

Z binding of various signalling and sorting proteins1 “2. In most eukaryotes, the membranes

I of the Golgi assume a characteristic stacked morphology With cisternae that differ in

""ID enzymatic content and activity13914. This highly polarized organization deﬁnes cis-, medial-

: and transcisternae, With the cis-Inost cisternae facing the ER”. The trans-Inost cisternae

§ face the trans-Golgi network (TGN), a tubular vesicular cluster that executes ﬁnal sorting

2 steps to post-Golgi destinations, exchanges material With the endocytic pathway and can, at

g least in plants, eXist as an independent organelle from the Golgi16=17.

(5) Basic elements of the ER—Golgi interface

a With a few notable exceptions, including cytoplasmic, nuclear and signal peptide-containing
proteinslg, secreted proteins follow a conventional ER—Golgi secretory route. T0 eXit the
ER, fully folded soluble and membrane cargos are packaged into COPII-coated carriers at
specialized, long-lived subdomains 0f the ER, termed ER eXit sites (ERES)19»20. Although
the number, size and dynamics of ERES vary across cell types and species, most eukaryotic
cells examined so far display these organized export zones on ER membranes. ERES are

Z enriched in COPII and appear as discrete puncta during ﬂuorescence imaging of COPII coat

:F proteinszl—24. In addition to the core COPII components, large multidomain SEC16 proteins

j> models suggest that SEC16 establishes an ERES scaffold that recruits COPII to export zones

é through multiple interactions With coat subunits27. In all cell types studied, the COPII

9:: Mechanisms of interface control

g While most cell types examined use these basic conserved ER—Golgi trafﬁcking

3 components, studies are revealing additional layers of control that inﬂuence the morphology

E- of the ER—Golgi interface and transport carriers. In some cases, the COPII export machinery
seems to have adapted to manage diverse secretory cargos. For example, certain mammalian
cell types must export large secretory cargos from the ER such as 300—400 nm procollagen
ﬁbres33 or 100—500 nm lipoprotein particles, Which are larger than the reported size of a
standard 60—90 nm COPII-coated vesicle19=34. Several lines of evidence indicate that the
COPII cage is ﬂexible35=36, and this would allow the formation of larger COPII-coated

% intermediates and thereby the transport of large cargo. A combination of structural

'IU approaches has revealed that SECl3—SEC31 subunits can self—assemble into polyhedral

:9 cages of distinct orders through moderate variation in geometries of subunit

E interactions37_39 (FIG. 2). Such ﬂexibility in the COPII cage has also been observed in

3:)""- cells40 and in reconstitution studies using COPII proteins and giant unilamellar vesicles41.

""‘ These studies show that the COPII coat can form extended tubular structures and constricted

9:, tubules resembling ‘beads on a string’ that are of sufﬁcient dimensions to accommodate

g procollagen ﬁbres.

H- genetic studies have revealed that isoform-speciﬁc mutations in SEC23A cause
developmental defects due to deﬁciencies in collagen secretion, Whereas smaller secretory

cargos undergo normal trafﬁcking4244. Similarly, human ohylomioron retention disease has
been linked to mutations in the SARlB isoform, Which cause fat malabsorption due to

Z deﬁciency in the secretion of large lipoproteins from enterooytes45=46. Interestingly, the

E interaction of SARI isoforms With distinct coat subunits and appropriate regulation of SARI

'IU GTPase activity seem to be crucial for the export of large prooollagen and chylomicron

3): oargos in COPII carriers. Recent studies have also revealed that monoubiquitylation of the

E. SEC31 subunit is required for ER export of prooollagen in developing mouse embryonic

8:- stem cells“. This post-translational modiﬁcation could alter SEC31 structure and ﬂexibility

g or recruit a cofactor that inﬂuences COPII assembly to generate large vesicles. Collectively,

% these ﬁndings support a model wherein distinct subunits of COPII can be assembled in

a different geometries and modulated by SARI GTPase activity to produce different sized

é. transport carriers in various cell types.
The composition, size and number of ERES also vary across cell types and are inﬂuenced by
the cargo that is being secreted. Cells that export large prooollagen from the ER depend on
the transmembrane TANGOl—CTAGES (transport and Golgi organization protein 1—
outaneous T cell lymphoma-associated antigen 5) complex that localizes to ERES and has a
crucial role in ER export of selected oargo48=49. The TANGOl—CTAGES complex interacts

Z With SEC23—SEC24, but is not itself packaged into COPII carriers. Instead, it is thought to

% coordinate prooollagen capture into large vesicles at ERES through binding to lumenal

j> prooollagen and regulation of cytoplasmic SEC23—SEC24 (REF. 49). Interestingly,

E orthologues of TANGOl and CTAGES have only been identiﬁed in vertebrates, suggesting

'5: that this complex has evolved to manage large cargo in specialized cell types. Indeed, in

9* plant cells, large cellulose ﬁbrils are polymerized directly at the plasma membrane rather

“Z, than being assembled before their seoretion50. In addition to the effects of cargo dimension

2 on ERES composition, secretory cargo load inﬂuences ERES size and number. For example,

8 in plant cells the number of ERES and the recruitment of SEC24 to ERES increases in cells

a transiently expressing ER export-competent membrane cargo. However, this occurs only if
the cargo contained an ER export motif51. In mammalian cells, acute increases in cargo load
cause ERES to fuse, producing larger but fewer eXit sites. Conversely, a chronic rise in
secretory cargo increases both the size and number of ERES52 as well as the expression of
SEC24 and SEC16 in part through the activation of an ER stress-sensing unfolded protein
response (UPR) pathway53. These ﬁndings demonstrate that cargo type, size and volume

Z inﬂuence ERES structure and abundance, and that the cargo can inﬂuence the organization

:F of the ER—Golgi interface. More generally, the UPR is likely to have a prominent role in

; controlling ER—Golgi membrane structure and function during the development of many cell

j> types.

8- After secretory oargos have exited the ER in COPII carriers, these intermediates fuse with

% target membranes using a conserved core machinery. However, the distances that these ER-

% derived carriers travel and the requirement for cytoskeletal ﬁlaments differ depending on the

a cell type. The target membrane for COPII carriers also varies in addition to the set of

g. tethering factors that are engaged. For example, animal cells rely on microtubules to guide

2‘ COPII vesicles towards an ER—Golgi intermediate compartment (ERGIC) en route to cis-
Golgi oompartments54. Indeed, multiple types of miorotubule-based motors localize to this

that are characteristic of the ERGICSS. By contrast, in other species, including yeast that

Z have a more compact ER—Golgi organization, COPII vesicles seem to fuse directly to cis-

Variations in the ER—Golgi interface
Models comparing the ER—Golgi interface in mammalian and plant cells are shown in FIG.
3 and FIG. 4. In cultured mammalian cells, the Golgi stacks are clustered and connected by
inter-cistemal tubules to form a Golgi ribbon57. This conﬁguration is fundamentally
Z different from plants, in which the Golgi is composed of individual stacks of ﬂattened
E oistemae58=59, termed Golgi bodies or stacks. This morphology is seen in the insect
'IU Drosophila melanogaster 60 and the yeast Pichia pastorzs22 as well as in the unicellular
3): parasites T rypanosoma brucei61 and T oxoplasma g0ndii62. The yeast Saccharomyces
g cerevisiae may represent an extreme example, in which cis-, medial- and trans-Golgi
8' oistemae seem to be completely unstaokedzz. Notably, the plant Golgi is distinct from these
% other species in that it shows rapid motility (up to 4 pm per sec)58, and this requires the
% activity of aotomyosin motors59=63_65 and close association with tubular ER strands. This
% latter feature is underscored by the absence in plants of the ERGIC, which is found in
S, mammalian oells66—69.
""9..
The ERGIC as a distinct intermediate organelle
Implicit in the ER—Golgi organization of eukaryotio species are different strategies to
efﬁciently transport cargo from the ER to the Golgi. In S. cerevisiae and in plant cells, ER—
Golgi transport ﬁts a simple model whereby COPII carriers shuttle cargo from the ER to the
Z Golgi by fusing directly with the cis-Golgi70 or by generating new oistemae by homotypio
IE fusion. In mammalian cells, the situation is more complex as the distances between ERES
; and the cis-Golgi compartment are longer than in yeast and plant cells. Indeed, the ERGIC
> may be necessary to facilitate this long-distanoe transport in mammalian cells. Previous
é models described the ERGIC as a specialized domain of the ER71 or the cis-Golgi72,
2 although it may be more appropriate to consider the ERGIC as a distinct organelle73=74 that
Z functions in COPI-dependent sorting of retrograde cargo, in concentration of anterograde
% biosynthetio cargo75 and possibly in post—ER protein quality control76. Early live-cell
<53 imaging analyses suggested that ERGIC structures may move from ERES to the Golgi by
%- tracking on miorotubules54=77. These results seeded the transport complex mode119=78
H‘ whereby newly unooated COPII vesicles would fuse to form transient pleiomorphic
vesicular tubular clusters, which would then be transported to the Golgi Via long-range

microtubule tracks and dynein motors. The tubular clusters would either homotypieally fuse
to form new cis-Golgi cistemae, or they would fuse with the ﬁrst cistemae of the cis-Golgi.

Z COPI-coated vesicles formed from tubular clusters and cis-Golgi membranes would then

If recycle components back to the ER (FIG. 3a).

; An alternative model for ER—Golgi protein transport in mammalian cells, termed the stable

5 compartment model, Views the ERGIC as a more static structure. This model proposes that

g: positioning of the ERGIC between ERES and the Golgi facilitates a two-step transport

% process, which involves short-range mierotubule-independent transport of COPII vesicles

% from ERES to the ERGIC followed by long-range microtubule-dependent transport of

a anterograde cargo-rich domains from the ERGIC to the cis-Golgi. Mierotubule-assoeiated

2. proteins such as the mierotubule plus enddirected motor kinesin and the minus end—directed

2- motor dynein have been found in association with the ERGIC. Moreover, functional
analyses indicate that kinesin operates in recycling of membranes to the ER, whereas dynein
is needed for anterograde transport54=79=80. In the stable compartment model, kinesin and
dynein would mediate steady-state positioning of the ERGIC but also have an active role in
transport: kinesin would facilitate mierotubule plus end-directed retrograde trafﬁcking to the
ER and dynein—dynactin would facilitate the transport from the ERGIC to the cis-Golgi74.

Z Elements of the aetin cytoskeleton such as actin-binding proteins (speetrin)11=81 and

% regulatory GTPases (CDC42)82 have also been invoked as dynactin-recruiting factors during

)> this process.

E . .

.5: Currently, it is not clear whether the stable compartment or the transport complex model

9, better explain ERGIC function in trafﬁcking. Imaging studies have shown that small soluble

9:) cargo is sorted into Golgi-direeted carriers from long-lived ERGIC structures83, although the

g machinery responsible for this event has not been deﬁned. It is also possible that both

8 mechanisms operate to transport cargos of varying size that move through the ERGIC. For

%- example, smaller cargo molecules could move through more mobile transport carriers,

H- whereas larger cargo present in mammalian cells may be trafﬁcked in ERGIC transport
complexes. Dual-label imaging experiments that simultaneously monitor ERGIC markers
and a broad range of secretory cargo may help resolve this issue.

COPII carrier dynamics in plant cells

2 Analyses in plant cells indicating that ER export can occur while Golgi stacks are moving in

IE close association with ER tubules84 raise a fundamental question of how proteins and

; membranes are efﬁciently transported from the ER to mobile Golgi stacks (FIG. 3b). One

> model has postulated that an active ERES produces a localized signal that uneouples a Golgi

association of foci with Golgi stacks has also been validated in several reports in which
other COPII proteins were labelled, including SARI, SEC23 and SEC24, and that

Z investigated both heterologous as well as endogenous plant expression systerns51=85_95 (FIG.

E 4f). Together, this supports the model that ERES are in continuous association with Golgi

:3 stacks24=96.

E The presence of COPII vesicles in plants is still debated. Vesicle-like structures have been

3:5: rarely detected89=97_99 in electron microscopy analyses of high-pressure frozen A. thaliana

% tissues; moreover, the directionality of such structures (that is, whether these are budding or

% fusing intermediates) could not be established. Nonetheless, in studies of high-pressure

a freeze-substituted A. thaliana root tip cells, irnrnunogold labelling analyses with antibodies

2. speciﬁc for A. thaliana SARI and SEC23 showed labelling of some vesicle-like

E- structures67=99. The difﬁculty to Visualize budding COPII vesicles in plants raises the
possibility that these entities may be very quickly consumed at the ER surface. Through
optical manipulation of individual Golgi stacks with laser tweezers100 in highly vacuolated
cells, it has been shown that lateral displacement of individual Golgi stacks is followed by
continued link—age and rapid growth of the attached ER tubule. This ﬁnding indicates that in
these plant cells the Golgi and ER are ﬁrmly attached, possibly through a tethering matrix at

E the Golgi—ER interface that physically links the two organelles together84.

I

g The association of ERES with individual Golgi stacks in plant cells is conceptually feasible

> in the context of a rnatriX-rnediated attachment of the ER with Golgi stacks. For example,

é ERES could facilitate export to a Golgi stack at an ER—Golgi interface that is relatively

2 static. Such an organization would be more energy efﬁcient than a system that stochastically

Z produces ERES. This may be analogous to Caenorhabditis elegans in which ERES are

E closely juxtaposed to the Golgi and proteins such as the SEC-l6-interacting protein TFG-l

8 direct movement of COPII carriers away from the ERIOI. It is also possible that in addition

%- to ERES—associated Golgi, new ERES may be formed on the ER to initiate de novo

H- assembly of Golgi stacks. Fluorescent protein localization analysis has shown that the YFP—
SEC24 fusion protein is enriched at the Golgi surface97, and this was proposed to represent
the accumulation of COPII carriers before fusion97. This possibility is consistent with
ﬁndings in yeast and mammalian cells showing that COPII may be partially retained on ER-
derived carriers until they reach the Golgiloz. As mentioned above, putative COPII vesicles

Z have been detected in close association with cis-cisternal Golgi elements in electron

E rnicroscopy analyses of A. thaliana cells, and the formation of these initial ciS-cisterna may

""'0 be functionally analogous to the mammalian ERGIC67. Disassernbly of COPII coats is

3): initiated when SARI hydrolyses its bound GTP (BOX 1), although coat subunits seem to be

S. slowly released after carrier formation. It has also been shown that ﬂuorescent protein

a fusions of two plant SARI isoforrns distribute along the ER facing the Golgi”. Together,

z these ﬁndings suggest that ER export in plant cells relies on a unique organization in which

% a specialized subdomain of the ER and an associated Golgi stack act as a secretory unit with

5 COPII carriers being formed and quickly released at the ER subdornain and partially coated

é. COPII carriers then associating with the Golgi. Additional validation of this model could be

"""" achieved by analysing the subcellular distribution of SEC16, which would be predicted to
associate with the ER-facing Golgi stacks. A scenario in which COPII vesicles form and are

transported from the ER at a rate that is faster than COPII unooating at the Golgi is
consistent With the observation that ﬂuorescently tagged versions of COPII components can

Z be readily Visualized in live plant cells, although COPII vesicles have rarely been seen at an

E ultrastructural level in plantle3—106.

_'U

> In contrast to mammalian cells, plant ER—Golgi transport does not depend on cytoskeletal

E components. In highly vacuolated plant cells, the Golgi undergoes actornyosin-dependent

3:5: movement, but chemical inhibition of this movement does not disrupt the transport between

% the ER and Golgi. This has been demonstrated by ﬂuorescence recovery after

g photobleaching (FRAP), in Which markers were tracked in immobilized Golgi after treating

5 cells With aotin-disrupting ohernioalsz. Miorotubules also do not seem to be involved in ER—

2. Golgi protein transport in plants; for example, rates of ER—Golgi protein trafﬁc are similar

2. in cells With depolyrnerized actin and in cells depleted of both actin and rniorotubulesz.
Fluorescence recovery of cycling proteins has also been observed upon photobleaohing of
Golgi in untreated oells24, again supporting the model that ER export can occur toward
rnotile Golgi. However, it has not yet been established Whether there are differences in ER—
Golgi transport kinetics between cells With disrupted versus intact aotin, or between fast or
slow moving Golgi stacks.

Z

% Different forms for unique functions

3): A conserved core machinery transports biosynthetio cargo forward in the early secretory

g pathway and is balanced With retrieval routes that maintain the ER and Golgi compartments.

8' In eukaryotio cells, COPII assernbly produces transport intermediates from the ER, Which

% then rely on RAB GTPase-dependent tethering factors and the SNARE-dependent

% membrane fusion machinery for delivery of cargo to the Golgi. Similarly, retrograde

% transport depends on the COPI machinery to produce retrograde-direoted vesicles that also

2. require conserved tethering factors and SNARE proteins for fusion With ER membranes. In

2- spite of this conservation, diversity in eukaryotio cell types and cellular functions generate
tremendous variety in the organization of this ER—Golgi interface. Each trafﬁcking step
between ER and Golgi compartments provides multiple opportunities for regulation that
could inﬂuence vesicle and organelle size and shape. Indeed, there are now clear examples
in Which the expression levels of these core components and their covalent modiﬁcation (for
example, phosphorylation or ubiquitylation) alter the morphology of COPII carriers.

% Moreover, the additional control provided by accessory factors such as TANGOl and

JD CTAGES and cytoskeletal components in certain cell types also affects ER—Golgi

> organization. Finally, inherent ﬂexibility in both the COPII35 and COPI107 coats that allows

E oargos of different sizes to be accommodated can inﬂuence the morphology of ER—Golgi

"
"12","Brandizzi and Barlowe Page 12
should provide important insights into how trafﬁcking and compartmental organization are
integrated Within the early secretory pathway. For example, the existence of an ERGIC in

Z certain cell types and not in others remains mysterious. As discussed above, P. pastoris

E yeast cells56 and vacuolated plant cells106 lack an ERGIC but instead contain compact ER—

""IU Golgi units (S300 nm distance between the two organelles) that are thought to be ﬁrmly

3): connected through a tethering matrix. However, such a compact arrangement may not

é provide the space that would be needed for the assembly of large cargo into dissociating

2 transport carriers Without generating membrane connections between the ER and Golgi

g compartments. Indeed, there are no known large secretory cargos (Z300nm) in P. pastoris or

g A. thaliana. By contrast, active secretory cells in vertebrates generally contain an ERGIC,

c5? and these cell types often transport large cargo molecules such as procollagen.

_,

2. Cellular architecture as a driving force for interface organization
Although the cargo that is being transported may be one driver of ER—Golgi organization, an
alternative structural demand for the ERGIC in vertebrate cells may be to bridge the large
distance between the perinuclear ER and the plasma membrane. In this context, the ERGIC
and a microtubule network may be needed to facilitate efﬁcient transport and limit diffusion

Z of intermediates. By contrast, the plant ER and Golgi are ‘sandwiched’ Within a thin layer of

E cytoplasm between the tonoplast and the plasma membrane due to the presence of a central

'IU vacuole that occupies most of the cell volume (FIG. 4d). Cytoskeletal elements may

3): therefore not be needed to facilitate bidirectional ER—Golgi trafﬁc or to restrict diffusion of

5 transport intermediates. Finally, a more extensive set of ER—Golgi tethering factors is

8' present in cells that contain an ERGIC. In plants, there are no apparent homologues of

% mammalian GRASP65 (Golgi reassembly-stacking protein of 65 kDa), GM13O (cis-Golgi

% matrix of 130 kDa) and giantin vesicle tethering factors108. However, plants do require a

3 p115 homologue for ER—Golgi transport and express other Golgi-looalized coiled-coil

2, domain proteins With sequence identify to tethering faetors109. Although the function of

P'- these proteins has yet to be determined, this simpliﬁed set of tethering factors may underlie
matriX-mediated attachment of ER—Golgi units in plants. Nevertheless, questions regarding
how the ERGIC is generated and maintained in mammalian cells remain unanswered.
Interestingly, loss of GM13O leads to the disruption of the mammalian Golgi ribbon1 10. The
absence of GM13O homologues in plants may suggest that the acquisition or loss of
specialized tethering factors may have been a contributing factor for the unique organization

% of the plant Golgi during evolution from the last common eukaryotic ancestor.

I

; Notably, variations in the ER—Golgi interface can also eXist Within the same species. For

g example, most characterizations of ERES in plant cells have been acquired in highly

5-"" vacuolated cells. In specialized tissues such as root meristem cells and columella cells that

91 are comparatively less vacuolated, a large percentage of Golgi stacks (370%) have been

“Z, reported to not closely associate With the ER106. How ER export occurs towards Golgi

g stacks in these cells is unknown. Although most cells are highly vacuolated in plants, these

Conclusions and perspectives

Z A useful guide for the biologist’s View of the cell has been that structure reﬂects function.
E This perspective has been powerfully applied to the study of membrane trafﬁc With an
'IU understanding that the molecular basis for observed membrane structures and dynamics is
> tightly coupled With function. In this Review, we focus on individual stages in membrane
E transport that inﬂuence organization of the ER—Golgi interface. Through a comparative
3:5: analysis of model systems, we begin to see how this core structural machinery is adapted to
—, meet cell-speciﬁe requirements. However, future studies Will need to further integrate
Z . . .
% cellular regulatory networks that control biosynthetie rates and ﬂux through trafﬁcklng
a routes With this core machinery. For example, changing developmental and environmental
2. conditions that alter the proﬁle of protein and lipid cargos must be integrated in a manner

2- that maintains the organization of the ER—Golgi interface. Global regulation through the
UPR clearly has a key homeostatic role in coordinating protein and lipid biosynthetie rates
in response to environmental conditions. But studying how the UPR orchestrates such
adaptation may be challenging because there are multiple branches of the UPR in animal
and plant eells53=111, and these are likely to work in concert With several other signalling
networks that regulate membrane trafﬁc. Advancing such ‘systeIns-level’ questions Will

Z depend on the identiﬁcation of all required factors, in viva microscopy and eell-free assays
% to accurately measure cargo biosynthetie and transport rates, as well as the elucidation of the
)> sensor networks that are in place for overall coordination of distinct trafﬁcking steps.

5 Continued comparative analyses across a range of model organisms should ultimately allow
'5: us to further deﬁne the mechanisms that underlie the regulation of ER—Golgi transport in the
9* context of cellular function.

Figure 3. The ER—Golgi interface and ERES have a distinct organization in mammals and plants
a | In mammalian cells, ER exit sites (ERES) are orientated towards a juxtaposed
endoplasmic reticulum (ER)—Golgi intennediate compartment (ERGIC). Coat protein
complex 11 (COPII)-coated vesicles originate Within cup—shaped ER subdomains, Which are
associated With the plus end of microtubules. Upon ﬁssion of vesicles from the ERES, the
Z SEC13—SEC31 ca e is de 01 Inerized, but the SEC23—SEC24 coat is artiall retained.
I g P y P y
'IU Vesicles reach the ERGIC in a microtubule-independent manner Where they are tethered
:9 through the interaction between SEC23 and the TRAPPI (transport protein particle I)
E tethering complex. COPI mediates forward protein transport from the ERGIC towards the
§- Golgi as well as recycling back to the ER membrane (the latter is not shown). b | In plant
% cells, ERES and Golgi are closely associated, possibly through a matrix (indicated in grey)
m that holds the ER and the Golgi together. The existence of COPII vesicles in plants is still
2 debated (denoted by the question mark); vesicle—like structures have been seen89=97=99=106
9, rarely in electron microscopy analyses of high-pressure frozen Arabzdopszs thalzcma tissues,
T: although it was unclear Whether they were undergoing budding 0r fusion. Unlike
mammalian cells, plant cell ER—Golgi transport does not rely on the microtubule
cytoskeleton.
