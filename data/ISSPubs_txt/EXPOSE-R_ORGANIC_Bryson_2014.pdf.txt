Abstract: The ORGANIC experiment on EXPOSE-R spent 682 days outside the International Space
Station, providing continuous exposure to the cosmic—, solar- and trapped-particle radiation background for
fourteen samples: 11 polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) and three fullerenes. The thin ﬁlms of the
ORGANIC experiment received, during space exposure, an irradiation dose of the order of 14 000 M] m—2
over 2900 h of unshadowed solar illumination. Extensive analyses were performed on the returned samples
and the results compared to ground control measurements. Analytical studies of the returned samples
included spectral measurements from the vacuum ultraviolet t0 the infrared range and time-of—ﬂight
secondary ion mass spectrometry. Limited spectral changes were observed in most cases pointing to the
stability of PAHs and fullerenes under space exposure conditions. Furthermore, the results of these
experiments conﬁrm the known trend in the stability of PAH species according to molecular structure:
compact PAHs are more stable than non-conipact PAHs, Which are themselves more stable than PAHs
containing heteroatoms, the last category being the most prone to degradation in the space environment. We
estimate a depletion rate of the order of 85 i 5% over the 17 equivalent weeks of continuous unshadowed
solar exposure in the most extreme case tetracene (smallest, non-compact PAH sample). The insigniﬁcant
spectral changes (below 10%) measured for solid ﬁlms of large or compact PAHs and fullerenes indicate a
high stability under the range of space exposure conditions investigated on EXPOSE-R.
