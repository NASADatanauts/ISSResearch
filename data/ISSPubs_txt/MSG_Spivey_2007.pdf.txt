The Microgravity Science Glovebox (MSG) is a double rack facility aboard the
International Space Station (ISS) designed for gravity-dependent phenomena investigation
handling. The MSG has been operating in the 188 US Laboratory Module since J uly 2002.
The MSG facility provides an enclosed working area for investigation manipulation and
observation in the 188. The MSG’s unique design provides two levels of containment to
protect the ISS crew from hazardous operations. Research investigations operating inside
the MSG are provided a large 255 liter work volume, 1000 watts of dc power Via a versatile
supply interface (120, 28, i 12, and 5 Vdc), 1000 watts of cooling capability, Video and data
recording and real time downlink, ground commanding capabilities, access to 188 Vacuum
Exhaust and Vacuum Resource Systems, and gaseous nitrogen supply. With these
capabilities, the MSG is an ideal platform for research required to advance the technology
readiness levels (TRL) needed for the Crew Exploration Vehicle and the Exploration
Initiative. Areas of research that will benefit from investigations in the MSG include thermal
management, ﬂuid physics, spacecraft fire safety, materials science, combustion and reacting
control systems, in situ fabrication and repair, and advanced life support technologies. This
paper Will provide a detailed explanation of the MSG facility, a synopsis of the research that
has already been accomplished in the MSG, an overview of investigations planning to
operate in the MSG, and possible augmentations that can be added to the MSG facility to
further enhance the resources provided to investigations.

The Mierogravity Science GlovebOX (MSG), shown in Fig. 1, is a research facility on—board the International
Space Station (188) in Which fundamental and applied scientific research is conducted that supports NASA’s
Vision for Space Exploration. The unique design of the facility allows it to accommodate science and technology
investigations in a “workbench” type environment. The facility has an enclosed working volume that is held at a
negative pressure With respect to the crew living area. This allows the *J‘W7‘77 .75

integration team of engineers and support personnel is available at the
Marshall Space Flight Center (MSFC) to assist researchers With the complex task of building and operating an
experiment for space. The team advises experiment development groups on engineering issues during the design
phase of their investigation, assists With 188 manifesting and planning, and provides support through the testing and
analysis activities that are required to assure that experiments are compliant With 188 safety and interface
requirements. An engineering unit and development unit is available at MSFC for use during payload development,
verification, and on—orbit operation. A high fidelity training unit is located at the J ohnson Space Center for training
of ISS crew members. Once experiments are transported to the ISS, either by the NASA Shuttle, the Russian Soyuz
0r Progress vehicles, or the European Space Agency’s (ESA) Automated Transfer Vehicle (ATV), the crew installs
the experiment hardware in the MSG and configures it for operation. Depending on its design, the actual experiment
can be conducted either by the crew or by the ground—based investigator through two—way real—time data links.
Experiment progress can be monitored from the ground through the several MSG Video cameras, or cameras
embedded in the experiment. A teleseience center at MSFC provides investigators a link to interact With the
experiment during ﬂight operations. The investigator can be located at either MSFC or their home laboratory, Where

"5","C. Data Handling

The MSG data handling system allows for communication With the MSG facility and experiments plus
remote operation of the MSG facility and experiments operating inside the WV. The following interfaces are
provided to experiment hardware in the work volume; MIL—STD—1553B (Via the laptop computer), RS—422 Serial
Interface and Digital Input/Output (I/O) and Analog Input Interface. Investigations are also provided an Ethernet
interface that is directly connected to the ISS Ethernet.
D. Video Systems

The MSG Video System is provided to observe and record experiment behavior. The MSG Video Drawer
consists of the following: four Video recorders, multi—input LCD monitors, Hitachi HV—C20 CCD full color cameras,
touCh—pad, footswiteh and a headset/mierophone. The Video system has the capability to simultaneously record the
Video signal, display it on the monitors and downlink the Video signal to the ground. Experiments that provide their
own Video cameras must send both Composite and Y/C signals to the MSG Video system. The Composite Video
signal is used to View the camera images on the MSG monitors and for downlinking the Video signal. The MSG
Video recorders require the Y/C Video signal. Playback is possible on all of the recorders.

There are several ways to operate the Video system; it can be commanded from the ground, manually on the
recorder itself or by the use of a touCh—pad. The Video system provides the capability to annotate text onto the Video
signal and has a time counting system that can be recorded on the Video signal and displayed to the operator. The
Video system has time—lapse capability that allows for extended recording time. The time—lapse settings have two
variables that the investigator can Choose from, the length of recording and pause period. The range for the length of
recording is 0.5 to 25.5 seconds increasing in intervals of 1/10 a second, and the range for the pause period is 5 to
255 seconds in intervals of 1—see0nd steps.

There are two types of recorders used in the MSG Video system: two Sony DSR—V10 DV—CAM digital Video
recorders With 40 minutes of recording time per digital tape, and two GV—A500 Hi8MM analog recorders With 240
minutes of recording time per tape. Audio can be recorded simultaneously on all four Video recorders through the
MSG headset/mierophone.

E. Thermal Control Interfaces

The MSG Thermal Control Subsystem (TCS) provides both water cooling and avionics air cooling for
experiment hardware. Water cooling is provided by a 350 mm X 400 mm coldplate embedded in the WV floor. The
coldplate is located on the left side of the work
volume floor and is capable of dissipating 800W NORMAL MODE FLAPPER BANK RECQ/“IQESESSS'ON
under steady state conditions. Experiment PROCESSCONTROL ASSEMBLIES < /
hardware is mounted to the coldplate With M6 VALVES ‘_ a
threaded captive fasteners. Researchers can ' V i
tighten the fasteners as needed to meet their VL'—
thermal requirements but they must not exceed
60 in—lbs of torque.

The work volume air Circulation is '
established by the MSG Air Handling Unit
(AHU). The AHU heat exchanger provides 200 REFERENCEDUCT
W of investigation cooling, at an airﬂow rate of
1200 l/min and a maximum velocity of 0.044
m/s at the centerline of the work volume. The ‘
airﬂow can be varied between 15% and 100% I J
depending on fan speed settings. The filtration ilﬁ F
system provides for particulate removal, gm
filtration of single spillage, and oxidation of CO AIRLOCK ”' FELET:ND
to C02 by means of a built—in catalyst. Due to :
the hydroseopie nature of the MSG filters, the DI CHECKVALVE
humidity inside the WV is maintained at or
below the 135 cabin ICVCL Fig- 4 PYOVidCS 8‘ Figure 4. MSG Air Circulation and Filtration.

"
"6","F. Experiment Laptop Computer

The current laptop provided to MSG experiments is an IBM A3lp With a 60 gigabyte hard drive and l gigabyte
of RAM. The laptop supports dual Ethernet, 1 RSZ32/422 (Via converter), and USB (Via operating system)
interfaces. The operating system is Windows 2000 (Service Pack 4).

Researchers are encouraged to use the server system on the laptop that was developed by the MSG integration
team. The laptop server system is a suite of applications that executes on the MSG Laptop Computer. The purpose
of the laptop server is to abstract the input/output of the system When experiment applications are running and
provide support for various on orbit operations. The laptop server abstracts the 1553B interface, the Serial
(R8232/RS422) connections and the Medium Rate Data Link (Ethernet). Instead of each application developer
spending the time and effort required to get familiar With each of these interfaces, they may concentrate upon their
specific application. The laptop server presents to the applications developer a relatively simple Application
Program Interface (API) that uses the basic Windows system function calls. The laptop server provides a consistent
interface to each application and allows multiple applications to share information through the defined application
interface. The laptop server also provides for extensive ground commanding support (Timelines & Process Control)
to support un—attended operation. All existing interfaces to the laptop have been verified and used in ﬂight so the
risk of having communication problems during on—orbit operations is greatly reduced. Researchers can use a simple
web based system that allows them to issue commands and display experiment sensor measurements Via HTML. By
utilizing the FTP server on the laptop, the experiment can take advantage of the laptop hard drive for storage of data
that can then be down linked using the 188 Medium Rate Data Link. In addition, the laptop provides a socket based
interface to the 1553 data stream for experiment data output.

G. Vacuum Resource/Exhaust and GN2 Subsystem

The MSG is connected to the 188 Vacuum Resource, 188 Vacuum Exhaust, and GN2 subsystems. The
experiment interface to these services is provided inside the WV. The vacuum resource/vent line may be used to
operate a furnace or achieve a course vacuum. The vacuum exhaust/waste gas system is used primarily for venting
gases or byproducts given off by the experiments. However, the quality of the vacuum at the experiment interface
may be lower than the l X 10'3 torr at the MSG interface due to pressure drops in the ducts, quick disconnects etc.
GN2 can be used to inert the internal atmosphere and may provide means for controlling humidity.

The experimenter is provided With quick disconnects at the rear wall of the WV to interface With the vacuum and
GN2 resources. The WV is equipped With manually operated ball valves for the vacuum resource and eXhaust lines
and a needle valve for the GN2 line. There are limitations on the type of gases and materials that can be exhausted
into the ISS vacuum system, and the temperature and pressure of the eXhaust gases. See the Mierogravity Science
Glovebox (MSG) Investigation Interface Requirements Document (MSFC—RQMT—2888) for detailed information on
connector types and interface requirements concerning the vacuum and GN2 subsystem.

H. Air Circulation and Filtration

The MSG air Circulation and filtration system is illustrated by Fig 4 _
and Fig. 5. The MSG Air Handling Unit (AHU) has three separate fans that MSG Flltel‘ Banks
draw air from the WV through the filter banks and blows this air through _.
the water to air heat exchanger, the Process Control Valves and into the Air '1” I ‘1: -
Discharge Duet, Where the air is re—directed towards the WV. These fans F ﬂ. . _ !
maintain the WV pressure lower than the cabin pressure. Any potentially i ff"" -' ' ~ I !
contaminated air can only leave the WV Via the reference outlet following ! f 'j i -"" i' "" '
filtration. When the MSG is operating in Normal mode, the process control I F- "" _ ,1 ' '
valve is set to allow the air in the WV to be recirculated through the filters, ! -1 * 1"" “if
the fans, the heat exchanger, and back into the WV. In this mode the WV 1 , _ ""_ .
will maintain a pressure differential of at least 1.3 mbar between the WV '- _'2- r h ""
and the outside. When MSG is operating in Sealed mode, the process AirIOW'”jx' -
control valve outlets are sealed off, the fans are off, and no unfiltered air can ._.,m \i :
leave the WV. This mode is also used for experiments not requiring air T“ _ -
circulation in the WV. * - {1,-

As shown in Fig. 5, the MSG facility has three filter banks. Each filter . ‘f
bank has a set of four parallel front filters on a front filter plate and a set of
four parallel rear filters on a rear filter plate. The rear filters provide a , ,
backup filter system. Each front filter consists of four basic elements Figure 5' MSG Filter Banks.

Particle Air (HEPA) filter elements for particle filtration down to 0.3 micron size, an activated carbon element for
adsorbing solvents, Chemicals and gases, and a monolith element for oxidizing combustion products like carbon
monoxide. The rear filter is redundant With the front filter in its ability to filter organic solvents and convert carbon
monoxide, there is no HEPA installed in the rear filters. The MSG air Circulation system can provide up to 200W of
cooling.

I. Illumination

Three identical illumination units in the top of the WV provide the illumination of the working area. The three
illumination units combine to provide 1,000 LuX maximum illumination at approximately 200 mm above the center
of the WV ﬂoor. The general illumination is variable in intensity. At the maximum intensity the color temperature is
> 2,750 K, With color rendering index (RA) 0f 85 or better. The Airlock illumination provides 323 LuX general
working light. The illumination units can be switched on and off manually by the crew or remotely from the ground.
J . Airlock

The airlock, shown in Fig. 5, is a bOX—like structure attached to the bottom plate of the WV With an allowable
work area of approximately 26 liters. There is no active thermal conditioning in the airlock. The airlock temperature
is ambient, air Circulation provides conditioning of the airlock atmosphere only. Airlock illumination can be
switched on and off manually or remotely. The airlock front door provides a Lexan Window and a glove port. The
front door can be fully removed for ease of loading investigation hardware With the dimensions of 254 mm (10"") by
343 mm (13.5 "") by 299 mm (11.7""). The Airlock top lid in the WV contains 18 M6 inserts on a 70 X 70 mm grid for
threaded fastener hardware mounting. The Airlock top lid can be removed completely and can be locked to create a
leak tight airlock connection. The topside 0f the airlock lid is equipped With a removable handle for the actuation of
the locking mechanism. When the handle is removed, a complete ﬂat surface is available for use inside the WV. An
oven—like concept is used inside the airlock to allow for ease in payload transfer from the airlock t0 the WV. The
concept consists of a tray, Which can be placed at two different heights or completely removed from the airlock. The
tray is equipped With seven bungee cords for attaching payloads. The filter used in the airlock is the same type as
used in the WV. Power is not available for experiments inside the airlock. The temperature and humidity of the
Airlock is monitored and is available in the MSG downlink data. Fig. 5 shows the location of the airlock 0n the
bottom right corner of the MSG work volume.

K. Available MSG Facilities

The MSG project hardware consists of an operational Flight Unit on—board the International Space Station, a
high fidelity training unit at the Johnson Space Center (J SC), a ground unit at the Marshall Space Flight Center
(MSFC), and a ﬂight equivalent engineering unit at MSFC. The ground unit is functionally equivalent to the ﬂight
unit and is available to researchers for development testing and fit Checks. The engineering unit is identical to the
ﬂight unit and is used to fully verify experiment compatibility prior to ﬂight. In addition, the engineering unit is
available for troubleshooting 0f in—ﬂight anomalies during ﬂight operations. The MSG projectalso provides
researchers With a ﬂight like A31P laptop computer as resources allow.

A telescience center at MSFC provides researchers a link to interact With the experiment during ﬂight operations.
The investigator can be located at either MSFC or their home laboratory, Where they are connected Via
communication links. The entire communication loop from the telescience center to the payload in the MSG can be
simulated using the MSG engineering unit and the telescience facilities at MSFC. This allows for a thorough Check
out of payload hardware, software, and communication systems prior to ﬂight and affords the researcher a high
degree of confidence that the planned experiment Will be successful in orbit.

"8","111. Overview of the Research Accomplished in the MSG Facility to Date
To date, the MSG facility has logged over 3000 hours of 0n—0rbit operations processing 14 investigations.
Areas of science that have benefited from experiments in the MSG include, ﬂuid physics, materials science, thermal
control, protein crystal growth, and technology demonstration. The paragraphs that follow contain a brief synopses
0f the investigations that have been performed in the MSG.
A. United States Sponsored Investigations
Solidification Using a Bafﬂe in Sealed Ampoules (S UBSA )1

One of the first materials science experiments on the International Space Station — the Solidification Using a
Bafﬂe in Sealed Ampoules (SUBSA) investigation was conducted during Expedition 5 inside the Microgravity
Science Glovebox. SUBSA was the first experiment to operate in the MSG facility on the International Space
Station.

The main objective of the SUBSA investigation was to improve science’s understanding of the formation of
semiconductor crystals. Semiconductor crystals are used for many products such as computer Chips, integrated
Circuits, sensors for medical imaging equipment, and detectors of nuclear radiation.

To control the opto—electronic properties of the semiconductor crystals, a small amount of an impurity — named
a dopant — has to be added to the pure semiconductor. Uniform distribution of the dopant in the semiconductor
crystal is essential for production of opto—electronic devices.

For the SUBSA investigation, telluriurn and zinc were used as dopants in an indiurn antimonide sample. The
samples were heated to 850 degrees Celsius and then directionally solidified to form a solid single crystal. The
SUBSA samples were loaded in Clear quartz arnpoules and the SUBSA thermal Chamber had a transparent gradient
zone which allowed the entire process to be captured on Video. Indiurn antimonide was selected because of its low
melting point of around 525 degrees Celsius and because it is useful for creating models that apply to a variety of
semiconductors. During processing, the scientist was able to observe the down linked Video images and command
the furnace from the telescience center at the Marshall Space Flight center to position the solid/liquid interface in the
most optimum position prior to the start of directional solidification. This unique capability, provided by the MSG
facility, allowed the scientist to optimize the investigation real time, and maximize the scientific return.

The SUBSA investigation was setup 0n—0rbit by Astronaut Perry Whitson and completed operation in October
2002 as part of Expedition 5.

T awards Understanding Pore F ormation and Mobility During Controlled Directional Solidification in a
Microgravity Environment (PFMI)2

The PFMI investigation sought to improve science’s understanding of solidification processes and the effects of
imperfections in the molten material. On Earth when scientists melt metals, bubbles that form in the molten material
can rise to the surface, pop and disappear. In microgravity, the lighter bubbles do not rise and disappear. Prior space
experiments have shown that bubbles often become trapped in the final metal or crystal sample. In the solid, these
bubbles, 0r porosity, are defects that diminish both the material’s strength and usefulness.

The Pore Formation and Mobility Investigation melted samples of a transparent modeling material,
succinonitrile (SCN) and succinonitrile water mixtures. The transparent material allowed scientists to observe how
bubbles form in the samples and study their movements and interactions.

The PFMI experiments heated the SCN samples to approximately 120 degrees Celisus and directionally
solidified them at translation velocities of 0.5 micrometers per second up to 10 micrometers per second. Two
cameras were used to collect real—time images of the samples as they were melted and subsequently resolidified in
the thermal Chamber.

Images were sent to the investigator on the ground working in the telescience center at Marshall Space Flight
Center. The investigator manipulated the investigation by sending commands to Change temperatures, growth rates
and other variables that affected sample processing.

The PFMI investigation processed over 20 samples in orbit and was returned on STS—l 16 in December 2006.
Investigating the Structure ofParamagnetic Aggregates from Colloidal Emulsions (InSPACE)3

The InSPACE investigation examined the way small magnetic particles interacted with the complex properties
found in magnetorheological ﬂuids. Magnetorheological (MR) ﬂuids are a Class of ""smart "" materials capable of
providing a rapid, controllable response when a magnetic field is applied. The low—graVity International Space
Station environment allowed research on particle interaction without the effects of sedimentation. An objective of

"
"9","the InSPACE investigation was to determine the true three—dimensional low—energy structure of a MR emulsion in a
pulsed magnetic field. The InSPACE investigation Visually studied the final, fine structure of the MR ﬂuid in a
pulsed magnetic field. This study helped researchers understand the competing forces that govern the final shape of
the structures.

The InSPACE hardware consisted of five major parts: the Helmholtz coil assembly containing the sealed Vial
that holds the MR ﬂuid; an optics assembly with two long working—distanee lenses, cameras, and base plate; an
aVionies assembly containing two displays, a square—wave generator, and the power distribution box; the light source
assembly; and three Video recorders, which are part of the MicrograVity Science Glovebox (MSG). The crew inserts
the coil assemblies into the optics plate. The square—wave generator then sends pulsed power input along the
Helmholtz coil, generating a magnetic field in the ﬂuid. The cameras, equipped with microscopic lenses, record the
activities of the ﬂuid mierostruetures with and without the magnetic field.

InSPACE was operated by Astronaut Don Pettit as part of Expedition 6.

Coarsening in Solid Liquid Mixtures-Z (CSLM-2)4

CSLM—2 is a materials science experiment designed to study the rate at which particles of tin suspended in a
liquid comprised of molten tin/lead alloy, increase in size, a process called coarsening.

CSLM—2 used the microgravity environment on the 188 to prevent the tin particles from rising to the top of the
mixture as well as to eliminate convection in the tirﬂlead mixture, which can inﬂuence coarsening.

In any mixture that contains particles of different sizes, the large particles tend to grow while the smaller
particles shrink in a process called coarsening. Tiny oil droplets coalescing into a large blob are one illustration, but
the process occurs in solids as well. Coarsening occurs on Earth during the processing of any metal alloy and thus
the coarsening process affects products from dental fillings to turbine blades. Since the properties of an alloy are
linked to the size of the particles within the solid, coarsening can be used to strengthen materials. This is the ease
with the majority of aluminum alloys used commercially today. Conversely, if the coarsening process proceeds too
long the material can weaken. This occurs in jet turbine blades and is one of the reasons why turbine blades must be
replaced after a certain number of hours of service. Thus developing accurate models of the coarsening process is
central to creating a wide range of new materials from those used in automobiles to those used in space applications.
The results of previous experiments performed on the Shuttle have done just that. These models have been
incorporated into a computer code that is being used to design many new materials, including materials of
importance to NASA's spaceﬂight program. Solid—liquid systems are ideal systems to study this coarsening process.
However, gravity can induce particle sedimentation and thus hamper the studies of coarsening in these mixtures on
Earth.

The CSLM—2 investigation intended to use the microgravity environment of the Space Station to study the
process of coarsening with reduced interference from the sedimentation that occurs on Earth. However, due to the
Columbia disaster, samples from CSLM—2, were not able to be returned to Earth in time for evaluating the results.
Although the data was lost, engineering data collected on equipment function can benefit subsequent experiments.
B. European Space Agency Sponsored Investigations

Since the inception of the MSG program, ESA has developed and operated nine successful investigations in the
MSG facility. Four experiments were developed by BSA as part of the Belgian TaXi Flight (BTF). The
investigations included COSMIC, DCCO, Nanoslab, and PromISS—l. This series of experiments were a part of the
science research activities performed in November 2002 aboard the 188 by Frank de Winne, ESA astronaut of
Belgian nationality. Nanoslab encountered technical difficulties and was not able to complete all of the scientific
objectives.

In October 2003, Spanish astronaut, Pedro Duque, performed MSG investigations Nanoslab and PromISS—2 as
part of the Spanish Soyuz Mission. The Nanoslab investigation was a follow on to the Nanoslab investigation that
encountered technical difficulties during the Belgian TaXi Flight. Duque spent eight days aboard the Space Station
conducting science experiments under a commercial contract between BSA and the Russian Aviation and Space
Agency.

In April 2004, MSG investigations HEAT and ARGES were operated as part of the Dutch Soyuz Mission. The
experiments were performed by Dutch ESA cosmonaut / astronaut Andre Kuipers who was launched to 188 from the
Russian launch site Baikonur on April 19th, 2004.

A thirty day PromISS—3 investigation was performed in January and February of 2004. The same setup was also
used during another thirty day PromISS—4 investigation that started in January 2006. Other PromISS investigations
are planned for future operations in the MSG. This illustrates the usefulness of the MSG facility. The primary

"10","investigation hardware remains on—board and future investigations require relatively little up mass to deliver new
samples for follow on experiments.

The following paragraphs provide a brief summary explanation of these ESA investigations. For more detailed
information concerning these investigations, please refer to the European Space Agency web page at
http_://www.esa.int.

Combustion Synthesis under Microgravity Conditions ( COSMI C )5

COSMIC studied mierostrueture formation of compressed powder samples (in casu Ti—Al—B) during self—
propagating high—temperature combustion processes (SHS). The main scientific objective was the investigation of
the relationship between general physiCO—Chemical mechanisms of combustion and formation of the microstructure
and composition fields. The COSMIC experiment was a part of the science research activities performed aboard the
188 by Frank de Winne, ESA astronaut of Belgian nationality in the frame of the ODISSEA Project. The European
Space Agency and Belgian Federal Office for Scientific, Technical and Cultural Affairs (OSTC) were responsible
for preparation and implementation of the scientific program.

Microgravity Experiment For the Measurement ofDiffusion Coefﬁcients in Crude Oil (DCC0)6

This research program aims to investigate the isothermal diffusion and the Soret effect (thermodiffusion). The
scientific community and petroleum industries have a great interest in the accurate measurements of diffusion and
Soret coefficients. The DCCO experiment objective was to measure diffusion coefficients of ternary mixtures of
organic compounds. The experimental data set included different liquid mixture mass fractions. The mixtures were
composed of n—dodeeane, tetrahydronaphthalene and isobutylbenzene that are compounds representative of the
crude oil Chemical families. The principle was to introduce liquid A into a column of the ternary mixture B by
removal of a slider gate. During the three to five hours—eXpeCted diffusion duration, the process was monitored with
a dual wavelength MaCh—Zehnder interferometer, measuring the Change in refractive index induced by concentration
gradients. From the resulting interferograms recorded on a photo camera, the concentration gradients are derived as
a function of time. The DCCO experiment was performed by Belgian astronaut Frank de Winne as part of the
Belgian TaXi Flight.

NANOSLAB7

NANOSLAB is physical sciences investigation involving zeolites. Zeolites are crystal formations with
structured spaces or pores that allow them to absorb or hold onto other materials such as water. The NANOSLAB
research has significance in areas including the petrochemical industry. The aim of this experiment is to try and
create more effective zeolite crystal structures by mixing different zeolite solutions with a range of erystal—forming
catalysts. The NANOSLAB experiment was conducted by Spanish astronaut Pedro Duque as part of the Spanish
Soyuz Mission.

Protein Microscope for the International Space Station (PromISS- 1, 2, 3& 4 )8

The PromISS investigations are a study of the crystallization of proteins in microgravity conditions. These
investigations seek to provide information that will lead to a better understanding of the fundamental processes
underlying the protein crystallization process. The major objective of the experiments is to produce a detailed
analysis and quantitative interpretation of the relationship between the quality of the crystals and the environment in
which they were produced. The obj eetives are to:

0 Further evaluate the effect of microgravity 0n crystal quality, as compared to experiments in gel.
0 Confirm that the removal of convection by the use of gels has a similar effect as microgravity
0 Quantify the relationship between position of growth of the crystal and crystal quality.

The PromISS investigation uses a Digital Holography Microscope to analyze the crystallization process. The
PromISS—l experiment was performed during the Belgian TaXi Flight in November 2002. Preliminary results
obtained show that the instrument was strongly affected by Vibrations and the temperature profile of the mission.
These factors had a bad impact on the quality of the results obtained.

An upgraded version of the PromISS—l hardware, called PROMISS—2 was uploaded with Progress HP in August
2003 and operated as part of the Spanish Soyuz Mission (SSM). SiX PROMISS experiment cells were uploaded
with the Soyuz 7S, analysed with the PROMISS—2 optical diagnostic hardware over 10 days, and downloaded with
the Soyuz 68.

"
"11","The PromISS—3 experiment was a re—ﬂight of the previous PromISS—Z experiment performed during the Spanish
Soyuz Mission, but with an investigation of the experimental cells in the Digital Holography Microscope of 30 days.
After the 30 day processing, the samples were stowed in an incubator (AQUARIUS) for 2 months, and then returned
on Soyuz 88. The PromISS—3 & 4 experiments are an adaptation of a digital holography instrument developed by
ULB —MRC for the observation of counter—diffusion experiments in microgravity. This instrument provided a View of
the crystallization reactions in terms of density gradients in the solution and of the localization of the crystals. The
observation of the density gradients should make it possible to evaluate models of the diffusion and residual
convection in the crystallization process. This information, together with the localization of the crystals, and the
observation of the timing of their growth, can allow the identification of the growth conditions of the crystals. This
information can then be related to crystal quality and internal order.

Heat transfer performance ofa grooved heat pipe (Heat)9

Heat was an investigation of the effectiveness of grooved heat pipes in the weightlessness of space. The main
aims of this technology demonstration were ;

0 The characterization of the heat transfer performance of a grooved heat pipe in weightlessness, by measuring the
maximum rate of heat ﬂow sustainable in three different modes:

— Anti—parallel heating/cooling (i.e. heating from one side of the pipe then cooling from opposite side).

— Mixed heating/cooling conditions (i.e. heating from two sides of the pipe then cooling from one of these sides)
0 The validation of the existing mathematical model that is used to evaluate the performances of new heat pipes.

0 To prove that the grooved heat pipe design can cope with the formation and trapping of vapor bubbles in the
pipe. A build up of vapor on the inner surface of a pipe creates an insulating layer, which reduces the pipes
effectiveness to transfer heat.

The Heat investigation was performed in April 2004 as part of the Dutch Soyuz Mission.

ARGES Investigation -- Energy efﬁcient lamps for the future”

The ARGES investigation sought to improve the understanding of High—Intensity Discharge (HID) lamps and
how they are affected by imperfections. The ARGES experiment examined these HID lamps in the microgravity
environment of the International Space Station.

The ceramic container of a HID lamp holds several metal gasses, sealed under high pressure. If a powerful
electrical current runs through the gaseous content, the metal atoms in the gas pick up energy and radiate light.
However, over time the gaseous contents begin to de—rniX or separate away from each other. As a consequence not
every part of the lamp has an equivalent amount of energy to transfer into light.

Unstable plasma channels and de—mixed gasses are the two biggest problems in HID lamps. Therefore, the main
objectives of the ARGES experiment were to determine which factors were causing these two problems. To do this,
the ARGES investigation employed a high—resolution emission spectrometer to analyze a series of individually
lighted HID lamps. Each light—producing gas in the HID has its own spectrum. The emission spectrometer was used
to determine which gases were present in small areas within the lamp.

Like the Heat investigation, the ARGES investigation was performed in April 2004 as part of the Dutch Soyuz
Mission.

IV. Future MSG Investigations

The many capabilities of the MSG detailed in this paper, make it an ideal platform for research required to
advance the technology readiness levels (TRL) needed for the Crew Exploration Vehicle and the Exploration
Initiative. Related areas of research that will benefit from investigations in the MSG include combustion, ﬂuids
physics, thermal control, fire suppression and detection, in situ fabrication and repair, material science, and life
sciences. Investigations currently planned for operation in the MSG include BXF, SAME, ZBOT, CCF, SPICE,
SODI, MFEU, and Micro Fluidic. The following paragraphs provide and brief overview of MSG investigations that
are planned for operation in the next two years along with some suggestions for other future MSG investigations.

"
"12","A. Investigations Planned for N ear Term Operation in the MSG Facility
Boiling eXperiment F acility (BXF)H

The BXF investigation Will obtain data needed to understand the process involved With boiling in gravity and
microgravity. The research should enable the development of more efficient cooling systems on future spacecraft
and on Earth.

Boiling efficiently removes large amounts of heat by generating vapor from liquid. It is being used in electric
power plants, electronic cooling and purification and separation of Chemical mixtures. An upper limit, called the
critical heat ﬂuX, eXists Where the heater is covered With so much vapor that liquid supply to the heater begins to
decrease. Supplying constant power above this limit for prolonged periods can increase the heater temperature to the
point whereby the heater is destroyed. Determination of critical heat ﬂuX in microgravity is essential for designing
cooling systems for space. Therefore, boiling is being studied to increase the effectiveness of cooling in space.

The Boiling eXperiment Facility (BXF) Will house two separate investigations, BXF—MABE and BXF—NPBX.
The purpose of the BXF is to validate models being developed for heat transfer coefficients, critical heat ﬂuX and
the pool boiling curves.

Smoke Aerosol Measurement Experiment (SAME)12

The SAME investigation is being developed by the NASA Glenn Research Center, ZIN Technologies, and the
National Institute of Standards and Technologies (NIST). The SAME experiment is designed to determine the
particle size distributions of the smokes generated from a variety of overheated spacecraft materials and from
microgravity fires. The objective is to provide the data that spacecraft designers need to properly design and
implement fire detection in spacecraft. This investigation Will also evaluate the performance of the smoke detectors
currently in use aboard the space shuttle and 188 for the test materials in a microgravity environment.

Zero Boil- Off T ank Experiment (ZBOT)13

The ZBOT investigation will improve the scientific understanding of the storage of cryogenic ﬂuids in low
gravity conditions. Effective, affordable, and reliable cryogenic ﬂuid storage is essential for propellant and life
support systems on interplanetary spacecraft. The Zero—Boil—Off (ZBO) approach is an innovative means of
controlling storage tank pressure by eliminating tank self—pressurization through a synergetic application of passive
multilayer insulation, an active heat removal system, and a forced mixing mechanism. ZBOT will result in design
guides for cryogenic ﬂuid storage tanks and a database of microgravity ﬂuid management data for specific in—orbit
or on surface applications. The end goal is to deliver cost—effective, reliable, and enabling design concepts for long—
term storage of cryogenic ﬂuids used in life support and propulsion.

The technology to be developed applies equally to short duration (50—100) day storage applications for the
envisioned 2010—2015 missions to the earth’s neighborhood and to long duration 100—1000 days interplanetary
missions beyond 2015. Consequently ZBOT Will encompass both microgravity storage in low and high earth orbit
and reduced gravity storage on the lunar, Martian or other planetary surfaces.

Critical Velocities in Open Capillary Channels (CCF)14

The CCF Experiment refers to a versatile experiment program for studying an important variety of inertial—
capillary dominated ﬂows that are of basic interest in ﬂuid physics and at the same time key to certain space
applications, but cannot be studied on the ground. Applications of the results are directed to the portion of the
aerospace community Challenged by the containment, storage, and handling of large liquid inventories (fuels,
cryogens, water) aboard spacecraft. The results are expected to be immediately useful for the design and testing, and
instrumentation for verification and validation of liquid management systems of current orbiting, design stage, and
advanced spacecraft. The results Will also be useful to improved life support system design, phase separation, and
enhancing current system reliability by designing into the system passive (in this case ‘Capillary’) redundancies.
Smoke Point in Coﬂow Experiment (SPICE)15

The Smoke Point in Coﬂow Experiment (SPICE) will observe nonbuoyant round laminar jet diffusion ﬂames in
air coﬂow at standard temperature and pressure (STP) to:

0 Determine the effects of fuel type, burner diameter and coﬂow velocity on smoke point properties.
0 Identify test conditions for Closed— and open—tip smoke point behavior and resolve mechanisms of these
transitions.

"
"13","0 Determine the effect of fuel type, burner diameter, and approach to the smoke point on luminous ﬂame
shapes.
0 Develop and evaluate models of soot formation, luminous ﬂame shapes and ﬂame radiation.

Data to be obtained from SPICE include Video of ﬂames, digital photographs of ﬂames, radiometer output, fuel
ﬂow velocity, fan voltage, and eoﬂow air velocity.
Selectable Optics Diagnostics Instrument (SODI)16

The SODI hardware is being designed by the European Space Agency (ESA) to operate in the MSG facility and
accommodate the Diffusion and Soret Coefficients (DSC) measurement investigation, the Inﬂuence of Vibration on
Diffusion in Liquids (IVIDIL) investigation, and the Aggregation of Colloidal Solutions (COLLOID) investigation.
The objective of this series of investigations is to;

0 Study diffusion and Soret phenomena and measurement of these coefficients in multi—Component mixtures
(liquids).

0 Study the inﬂuence of controlled Vibration stimuli on these diffusion processes.

0 Study the aggregation (Clustering) of colloidal solutions.

The instrumentation will employ several optical diagnostic methods including;

0 Mach Zehnder interferometry (M21)

0 Digital Holographic Microscopy (DHM)

0 Near Field Scattering (NFS)

0 Particle Image Veloeimetry (PIV)

0 Photogrammetry (PM)

These methods will be used to analyze a selection of liquids and gases in the microgravity environment.
Magnetic F luids Experiment Unit (MFE U )17

The MFEU investigation is designed to study heat and mass transfer phenomena in suspensions of magnetic
nanoparticles under the inﬂuence of variable temperature gradients and magnetic fields on different geometries. The
experiments will involve liquid ferroﬂuids in a cylindrical gap. The ferroﬂuids will be exposed to controlled
magnetic fields provided by toroidal coils. Cylindrical internal and external water heat exchangers will provide
temperature differences in the radial direction while the surface temperature at the outside wall of the magnetic ﬂuid
layer will be maintained constant. Temperature gradients will be measured by thermistors and optical observation of
a temperature sensitive liquid crystal layer.

MicroFluidic Light Experiment”

This ESA developed investigation will test the use of innovative micro ﬂuidiC devices which are the core
element of miniaturized medical diagnostic systems. The experiment will involve a series of miero—ﬂuidie Chips in a
light box that will be attached to one of the MSG cameras. Each of the Chips will be injected with a photoshate
buffer saline ﬂuid with suspensions of ﬂuorescent polystyrene micro beads. The MSG cameras will be used to
observe transport of ﬂuid through the Chip by capillary forces. Images will be saved on the MSG laptop computer
and down linked to the science team on the ground.

B. Other Potential Exploration Related Investigations that can be Accommodated by The MSG Facility

When President Bush announced a New Vision for Space Exploration on J anuary 4, 2004, he said:

“Research on board the station and here on Earth will help us better understand and overcome the obstacles that limit
exploration. Through these efforts we will develop the skills and techniques necessary to sustain further space
exploration.”

As the President mentioned in this quote, our knowledge of key technologies must be improved if we are to meet
NASA’s current exploration goals. To do this, we must perform research in an environment similar to the one that

"14","our spacecrafts and crew members Will actually experience during space travel. As discussed in this paper, the MSG
facility is a very capable and versatile resource that is available in the microgravity environment on the International
Space Station to perform this type of research. Much of the work needed to advance key technologies is already
underway. In fact, many of the papers published at the 45th AIAA Aerospace Sciences Meeting and Exhibit in
J anuary 2007, involve analytical techniques and technologies that could possibly benefit from performing
experiments in the MSG facility in the reduced gravity environment of the 188. The authors of this paper Wish to
encourage all Scientist and Engineers WhO are performing research in the Space environment to make an
investigation in the MSG facility a part of their development plan.
V. Possible enhancements to the current MSG baseline configuration
Within Europe, the European Space Agency (BSA) and Bradford Engineering BV (developer and manufacturer of
STS, MIR and 188 gloveboxes) have recently set—up a GlovebOX Technology Center Which has the following goals:
0 to present all potential scientific utilization of the Gloveboxes to (scientific) user—groups,
0 to share the acquired utilization knowledge With new users
0 to support easy access to well maintained GlovebOX models for experiment assessment and Check—
out
0 to support development of new technologies aimed at upgrading the existing facilities.
The GlovebOX Technology Center (GTC) is centered around 4 pillars:
0 Maintaining Glovebox Technology Expertise
0 Future Support Items Development
0 Marketing
0 Experiment/Spares support
Scientist and engineers from this community have recommended some potential enhancements to improve the
usability of the Mierogravity Science GlovebOX (MSG). These enhancements include the following;
1. Additional cooling capacity for experiments
2. Life Science GlovebOX filter technology for MSG
3. Sterilization capability based on ozone technology
4. Centrifuges (inside Airlock or inside WV)
5. Incubator, Peltier controlled, cooling and heating (inside Airlock)
6. Furnish, IR 0r microwave controlled (inside Airlock or inside WV) Diagnostic instruments (inside
WV) to enable direct feedback of experiment results, Which offers a more dynamic and efficient
way of testing, e.g. microscope, X—ray equipment.
7. Standard provided additional sensor capabilities for experiments inside WV, e.g. temperature
sensors, oxygen sensor With data acquisition through ECB.
This paper is limited in describing the first three subjects, Which Bradford Engineering BV believes are the most
promising and realistic ideas to be investigated and realized in the short term.

This Chapter describes a thermal pre—analysis/proposal, Which defines a possible MSG thermal hardware upgrade. It
addresses only the thermal condition of the MSG Experiment Payload and Will review the possibilities to expand the
temperature range and increase the thermal power dissipation of Experiments. The Thermal Control Sub—System 0f

The existing thermal limitations (current baseline) for MSG Experiment Payloads are:
0 The total allowed experiment power dissipation is S 1000 W
0 The maximum allowed to the WV Air Power dissipation S 200W
0 The maximum allowed Power dissipation Via thermal contact With Water CP is S 800W
0 The actual achieved minimum CP water inlet temperature is 26—280C.
0 Note: there are no possibilities to provide experiment cooling temperature level < 00C Without
additional thermal hardware units.
The purpose of the proposed MSG modification is to expand experiment possibilities, in particular;
0 To increase the total power dissipating from the experiment Within the MSG WV
0 To increase the maximum experiment power dissipation t0 the WV—air
0 To increase the maximum experiment power dissipating t0 the Water Cold Plate
0 To expand the temperature range for MSG experiments and to provide possibilities for low temperature
experiments
0 To provide constant surface temperature control (cooling/heating).
Twelve suitable technical solutions are proposed and described in 21 BE Technical Notes With reference, MSG—BE—
TN—0055 and 0056. The three preferred solutions are highlighted in this chapter.
Solution 2.
The existing MSG WCP Will be applied together With an additional MSG Work Volume Cold Plate (AWCP). In this
case the experiment Will have two contact surfaces for power dissipation. Flow distribution between two CPs Will be
adjusted to provide the best condition for the Experiment. The expected allowed Payload Power can be between
about 1200 — 2000W (800 WCP +1200AWCP).

Solution 4
In this case the Thermo Electrical Unit application is stipulated. Peltier Elements Will decrease the temperature of
the contact surface exposed to the Payload. The hot—surfaees of Peltier’s Will have thermal contact With the WCP.
Several contact surfaces are necessary to provide suitable TEU design, Which Will reduce the Peltier efficiency. The
expected cooling capability of the TEU is 300—400W @ 16—250C temperature level of contact surface and at
dissipated 700—900W heat power on the WCP contact surface.
4
Why is the TEU application necessary? Because if we route 300W directly to the WCP, its surface temperature Will
increase up to 370C temperature. Thus, to have 180C temperature level (@300W Payload Power) on the Experiment
contact surface Will cost about 500W electrical power.
The following data have been measured on the actual MSG Flight Unit WCP.
Case—A, MTL Water Flow 89 kg/hr
CP Payload/Heater Power 816W (692W is dissipating in water)
Water temperature outlet/inlet 36.1/29.50C
CP Surface temperature sensor 49.50C
Case—B, Water Flow 130 kg/hr
CP Payload/Heater Power 816W (710W is dissipating in water)
Water temperature outlet/inlet 29.0/24.3OC
CP Surface temperature sensor 41.6OC
The actual achieved minimum WCP water inlet temperature is about 26—28OC and this does not provide the low
(moderate) temperature level required by some potential MSG Experiment Payloads.
The proposed TEU can shift the temperature of (Low Power) MSG Experiments to the range 15°C — 25°C.
Taking into account the limitation of WCP water outlet temperature, the maximum Power dissipation of TEU shall
not exceed 800W. That Will define in turn the limitation of the TEU cooling capability, because the sum of the
consumed electrical power and cooling capability Will be the heat load into the WCP.
The expected TEU cooling capability limit is about 300—400W (TBC). If the Payload requires more power
dissipation, it Will be more effective to install the Experiment Payload directly to the WCP. The appropriate
recommendations Will be done after TEU thermal performance test.
For different Payload Power dissipation the TEU contact surface Will have different temperatures. For High Power
experiments (>400W) it is more effective to install the Experiment Payload directly on WCP contact surface. To
explain these phenomena two Characteristics have been calculated:
0 TEU contact surface temperature as a function of Payload Power
0 WCP contact surface temperature as a function of Payload Power (if Payload directly dissipates heat power
to the WCP)

This figure depicts the calculation result. The eross—point 0n the diagram shows maximum Payload Power Which can
be dissipated by means of TEU (about 450 W TBC). If the Payload power dissipation is greater than approximately
450 W as shown by the diagram, the payload should be mounted directly to the WCP.
Solution 9, 10, ll, 12
An Air Heat Exchanger (AHX) application is reviewed here. WV Air could be cooled With TEU, AHX—AWCP or
with an Air —Water Heat Exchanger. This would allow a payload to have a lower ambient air temperature for heat
dissipation. For solution #12 the Air Heat Exchanger having contact surface could be applied to decrease the
Experiment payload temperature, because WV air can have lower temperature potential than the CP contact surface.
For this application the Air Heat Exchanger (AHX) is directly connected With Payload. For all cases presented in
this paper, eases #9—#12, the Fan — application is stipulated. It can be lOW—pressure head fan’s, but some safety—mesh
at the fan’s inlet must be included in the design. The assumption was made that an additional heat power, Which Will
be dissipated t0 the WV—air, is 50—200W (depending on temperature level of cooling media/surfaee).

"18","Conclusions and recommendations for the Enhanced Cooling Capacity Concepts for MSG Experiments:
Three additional thermal units could be developed and manufactured to provide an enhanced Wide range of MSG
Experiment application. These units are:
0 AWCP (see Solution 2)
0 TEU (see Solution 4)
0 AHX / AWHX (see Solution 9/12)
The following Characteristics improvement is expected:
0 Power dissipation Increasing to the air is 100—200W
0 Power dissipation Increasing to the WCP/AWCP is A 800—1200W
0 Experiment Contact surface decreasing to 200C @ 300W Power
0 Experiment Contact surface decreasing to 00C @ 0W Power
Each additional thermal unit could be applied independently or in combination With another unit and that gives a
possibility to develop and manufacture each unit independently (sequentially).
2 - Life Science Glovebox F ilter T echnology for the Microgravity Science Glovebox
Maintenance and continuous improvement of the Glovebox capabilities is of essence to maintain a well performing
and state of the art set of Glovebox instruments on the 188. These instruments support a variety of science fields as
shown in the table below:
Glovebox (MSG) physics BGB and PGB
as part of BioLab MSG and PGB
Life Sciences Glovebox Animal and plant research State of the art dedicated, large
(LSG) capacity filters
BGB and MSG
MSG has been operational in the 188 since 2002 and the PGB since 2006. The BGB Will become available With the
launch of Columbus in 2007. LSG was foreseen to be launched in 2008, but unfortunately this program was
cancelled. The fact that LSG won’t be part of the ISS utilization anymore must have an impact on the foreseen life
science research.
Against this background, Bradford engineering BV has reviewed its design of MSG and LSG in terms of materials
used and air filtration to determine if (even limited) MSG could be used for LSG type experiments.
From a materials point of View, MSG and LSG use the same materials for the work volume and internal air loop.
For filtering, the picture is quite different. MSG uses a front and rear filter system and has no fresh air supply. The
MSG front filter contains (in the direction of flow) a HEPA, Charcoal and catalyst. The MSG rear filter duplicates
this capability except for the HEPA. The LSG filters also have the HEPA but then use a maximized active Charcoal
bed (impregnated Charcoal) dedicated to absorb/contain typical life sciences fluids/gases. MSG air ducts and the
Heat exchanger fins (after the filters) are alodyned Whereas the LSG air ducts are nickel plated and the heat
exchanger fins are anodized. It is evident that MSG can not directly be used for LSG experiments. In the remainder
of the Chapter, an approach is outlined to equip MSG With derivatives of LSG style filters and to perform the
necessary verifications.
Design and Development Approach
In principle two possibilities eXist to implement LSG filter capabilities in the MSG environment. The first option is
to blindly replace the MSG front filters and copy the square LSG Charcoal beds into the MSG work volume (WV)
and to develop interconnecting ducting to the bayonet MSG filter interfaces. This however, Will take serious

"19","amounts of space from the WV and Will result in completely different flow conditions for the MSG WV (both ﬂow
pattern and ﬂow rates). A more Viable option is to adopt the same active Charcoal as used for the LSG filters and
then to develop at MSG style filter (cylinder) based on sealing of the LSG ﬂow conditions. This Will also allow LSG
filter qualification test data to be used for qualification of the modified MSG filter. This approach keeps the same
interfaces and only yields a minor protrusion into the WV.
The selected approach is based on the strategy to use, to the maximum extent possible, the existing LSG filter type
performance qualification data. A sealing effort is made to determine the length of the MSG Front Filter cylinder
such that the same filter Characteristics can be achieved. The result Will be that MSG can provide the same
performance in terms of filtering ﬂuids or gasses, but an effort Will be required to verify the filter With respect to
MSG ﬂow conditions. This is simply due to the different volume of Charcoal and different speed settings for the
fans.
For the sake of nomenclature, the MSG filters for life science type applications are called MSG—L (dash L) filters.
Testing approach
Once the MSG—L filter is developed, a Filter Adsorption Capability Test Will have to be performed. This test is not
to demonstrate the ability to filter like the LSG filter (this is provided for by using the same activated Charcoal) but
to determine the absolute capabilities.
Therefore, the purpose of this test is to Clarify the adsorption capability of the MSG—L filter. The verification tests of
the LSG Filter were conducted to test Whether the filter adsorbs the specific (LSG specified) amount of Chemicals.
This MSG—L test Will be conducted to determine the maximum adsorption capability of the MSG—L filter.
The data received from this test campaign Will put forward the strict performance limits of the MSG—L filters. This
Will provide the scientist With Clear figures for the sealing and set—up of his/her experiments.

3 - Sterilization capability (based on ozone technology)
Bradford Engineering has developed, designed and manufactured the Biological Glovebox; BGB, for the Biolab—
Rack inside the Columbus module. One of the features of BGB is sterilization by means of ozone.
Sterilization With ozone has a number of advantages, certainly in space Where resources are limited. The sterilization
With ozone is done at ambient temperature and a pressure slightly under ambient (3 ~ 5 mbar). Ozone is quickly
produced When needed and therefore no storage capacity is required; not to say that ozone in this condition is hardly
storable.
To produce ozone only air and electricity are necessary. After use, the ozone returns to oxygen. No extra Chemicals
and no waste Which has to be brought up and down. In space, the cabin air can be used for the production of ozone
Without any special treatment. Care should be taken to select materials that are ozone resistance.
With normal cabin air an ozone concentration of 1200 PPM is achievable. To give an idea of the sterilization
potential of ozone the following bacteria were killed in tests Within 20 minutes With air Which has an ozone
concentration of 1200 PPM:
0 Actinobacillus aetinomyeetemcomitans
0 Bacillus atrophaeus
0 Escherichia coli
0 Streptococcus mutans
0 Bacillus staerothermophilus
In addition, spores of bacillus atrophaeus and bacillus staerothermophilus were destroyed in less than 2 hours.
Ozone concentrations higher than 0.2 PPM are dangerous for humans. Therefore, a sterilization system with a high
ozone concentration must be well protected. In case of a failure, ozone must not be allowed to escape into the cabin
air. Ozone has a distinctive odor and an odor threshold of 0.015 PPM, so if a leak occurs, the crew members Will be
warned in a very early stage. In addition, the escaped instable ozone molecules Will fall apart and become oxygen
again. In the case of a complete failure, n0 catastrophic situation can occur as long as the ozone generator is placed
inside the MSG. This is because, the MSG offers two levels of containment and has active Charcoal Which acts as an
ozone destructor. Nevertheless, With respect to safety, the main question is Which ozone concentration level is
20

"
"21","acceptable. This is a decisive factor not only for which bacteria and/or their spores, in combination with time, can
be killed off but also for which materials can be used.
To build a ﬂexible and safe ozone based sterilization unit we see a strong combination with the MSG, a new
enhanced Portable GlovebOX (PGB—O3) and Sterilization Unit (SU—O3). This combination can be used inside MSG
in order to configure a highly safe contained active environment. The SU—03, PGB—03, and MSG will offer a
sterilization capacity of 20 l and operate with a fixed ozone concentration level of 100 PPM (TBC) and a maximum
operating time of 8 (TBC) hours and runs on a 28VDC power outlet.

VI. Conclusion
The Microgravity Science GlovebOX (MSG) 0n the International Space Station (188) has been used for a large
body of research. The MSG has operated 0n—0rbit for more than 3000 hours performing investigations involving
material science, thermal management, protein crystal growth, life sciences, and technology demonstration. The
MSG’s unique design provides two levels of containment to protect the ISS crew from hazardous operations.
Research investigations operating inside the MSG are provided a large 255 liter work volume, 1000 watts of dc
power Via a versatile supply interface (120, 28, i 12, and 5 Vdc), 1000 watts of cooling capability, Video and data
recording and real time downlink, ground commanding, access to 188 Vacuum Exhaust and Vacuum Resource
Systems, and gaseous nitrogen supply. With these capabilities, the MSG is an ideal platform for space exploration
related research. Moreover, the MSG provides engineers and scientists a platform for research in an environment
similar to the one that spacecrafts and crew members will actually experience during space travel and exploration.
In addition, the facility is ideally suited to provide quick, inexpensive access to space for exploratory type
investigations that are necessary to gain an initial understanding of the role of gravity in the physics associated with
new research areas. Therefore, the MSG facility is a Vital component of NASA’s Vision for space exploration.
