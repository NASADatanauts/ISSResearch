1. Introduction
Myoglobin (Mb) has been employed as a model for investi-
gating the complex relationships between structure and
function in small globular proteins ever since its structure was
determined (Kendrew et al., 1960). Such studies took advan-
tage of the rich optical spectrum of Mb upon binding of 02 and
other small ligands (Antonini & Brunori, 1971). The three-
dimensional structure of Mb clearly shows that the haem
prosthetic group is deeply buried inside the protein scaffold
and that there is no obvious channel for the ligands to diffuse
t0 and from the haem iron. In 1966, Perutz and Matthews
proposed that a side-Chain rotation of the distal His64(E7) of
sperm Whale Mb could be responsible for ligand migration to
and from the solvent. This hypothesis was subsequently
conﬁrmed by structural studies on different myoglobins
(Bolognesi et al., 1982) and supported by extensive kinetic
experiments on site-directed mutants (Scott et al., 2001). The
photosensitivity 0f the reduced protein bound to CO, NO and
02 allows the migration of ligands through the protein matrix
to be followed. Recent crystallographic experiments on re-
action intermediates captured by nanosecond Laue crystallo-
graphy (Srajer et al., 2001; Bourgeois et al., 2003) have shown
that packing defects and internal cavities present in globular
proteins play a role in controlling the diffusion of ligand/
substrate to the active site, as has been suggested by others
(Schlichting & Chu, 2000; Brunori & Gibson, 2001).
