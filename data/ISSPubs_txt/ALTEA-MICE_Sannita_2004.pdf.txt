Abstract
ALTEA—MICE will supplement the ALTEA project on astronauts and provide information on the functional Visual impairment
possibly induced by heavy ions during prolonged operations in microgravity. Goals of ALTEA—MICE are: (1) to investigate the
effects of heavy ions on the Visual system of normal and mutant mice With retinal defects; (2) to deﬁne reliable experimental
conditions for space research; and (3) to develop animal models to study the physiological consequences of space travels on humans.
Remotely controlled mouse setup, applied electrophysiological recording methods, remote particle monitoring, and experimental
procedures were developed and tested. The project has proved feasible under laboratory—controlled conditions comparable in im—
portant aspects to those of astronauts’ exposure to particle in space. Experiments are performed at the Brookhaven National
Laboratories [BNL] (Upton, NY, USA) and the Gesellschaft fiir Schwerionenforschung mbH [GSI]/Biophysik (Darmstadt, FRG)
to identify possible electrophysiological changes and/or activation of protective mechanisms in response to pulsed radiation. Ofﬂine
data analyses are in progress and observations are still anecdotal. Electrophysiological changes after pulsed radiation are Within the

energy particles of potential relevance in space.
