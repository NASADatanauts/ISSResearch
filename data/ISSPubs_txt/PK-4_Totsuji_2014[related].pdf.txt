Study of Cyllndrlcal Dusty Plasmas 1n PK-4J; Theory and Slmulatlons
Hiroo TOTSUJI 1, Chieko TOTSUJI 2, Kazuo TAKAHASHI 3 and Satoshi ADACHI1
Abstract
An overview on theoretical works and numerical simulations on dusty plasmas With cylindrical symmetry is presented. The main purpose of
these works has been to investigate strongly coupled dusty plasmas Which are expected to be realized in the planned experiments by PK—4 0n the
International Space Station and experiments by PK—4J, a similar apparatus constructed here. The distribution of dust particles is analyzed, both
analytically and numerically, ﬁrst on the basis of the drift—diffusion equations as continuum and then numerical simulations have been performed,
taking the effect of discreteness into account.
