Decreased mitochondrial oxidative metabolism is a hallmark bioenergetic characteristic of malignancy that may have an
adaptive role in carcinogenesis. By stimulating proton leak, mitochondrial uncoupling proteins (UCP1—3) increase mitochondrial
respiration and may thereby oppose cancer development. To test this idea, we generated a mouse model that expresses an
epidermaI-targeted keratin-5—UCP3 (K5-UCP3) transgene and exhibits signiﬁcantly increased cutaneous mitochondrial respiration
compared with wild type (FVB/N). Remarkably, we observed that mitochondrial uncoupling drove keratinocyte/epidermal
differentiation both in vitro and in vivo. This increase in epidermal differentiation corresponded to the loss of markers of the
quiescent bulge stem cell population, and an increase in epidermal turnover measured using a bromodeoxyuridine (BrdU)-
based transit assay. Interestingly, these changes in K5—UCP3 skin were associated with a nearly complete resistance to
chemicaIIy-mediated multistage skin carcinogenesis. These data suggest that targeting mitochondrial respiration is a promising
novel avenue for cancer prevention and treatment.
