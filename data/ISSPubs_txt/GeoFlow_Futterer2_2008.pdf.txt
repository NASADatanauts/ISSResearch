Abstract. ’GeOFIOW’ is a thermal convection experiment in rotating spherical shell geometry,
Which is going to take place in microgravity environment of International Space Station. We
present numerical preliminary studies of the spherical Rayleigh—Bénard problem under an
artiﬁcial central force ﬁeld. Numerical simulation is done With a pseudospectral method. Special
focus here is the simulation of ﬂow states at selected parameter points of Rayleigh and Taylor
number of a deﬁned plan for experimental runs on 188. One loop will contain thermal convection
Without rotation, i.e. rising temperature gradient between inner and outer sphere. Another 100p
investigates convection superimposed by rotation, i.e. ﬁxing temperature gradient and then
rising rotation rate. In such cases different transitions are expected to be Observed. Just rising
Rayleigh number shows different stable states depending on initial conditions. Fixing Rayleigh
number and then rising up Taylor number leads to traverse of different convective states showing
rich dynamics of the system.
1. Introduction
Thermal convection in spherical shells is a fundamental model in geophysical ﬂuid dynamics.
Instabilities provide details for understanding large scale geophysical motions as convective
transport phenomena in the Earth’s liquid outer core. We face this hydrodynamical problem
With the ’GeOFIOW’ experiment on thermal convection in rotating spherical shells inﬂuenced by
a central force ﬁeld [1H2]. The experiment Will take place at International Space Station in
European Columbus Modul inside Fluid Science Laboratory. Set up of central force is done by
establishing a high voltage potential between inner and outer sphere using the dielectrophoretie
effect. Resulting acceleration due to radial buoyancy force achieves geiro % 10—1 m / 32 at outer
shell. Compared to acceleration due to gravity with g s 10 m/32, one can see that natural
gravity would always be dominant if experiments are done in a laboratory. Hence microgravity
conditions are necessary to perform the ’GeOFIOW’ experiment succesfully.

Running ’GeOFIOW’ in Fluid Science Laboratory environment requires automation of the
experiment. For this purpose an experiment ﬂow plan has been set up. Main parts of parameter
variation include set—up of temperature gradient between inner and outer sphere (corresponding
to Rayleigh number variation) and rotation of spherical system (corresp. to Taylor number
variation). Work schedule is splitted into two parts, a non—rotating (loop 1) and a rotating ease
(loop 2). During ﬁrst 100p rotation rate Will be set to zero While temperature difference Will be

force in microgravity environment we scale length by outer sphere radius r0, time by thermal

3. Numerical Results
3.]. Non-rotatmg case
Increasing Rayleigh number corresponds to strength thermal impulse of the system. Transition
from basic state to steady and further to irregular time—dependent convective states are found
for simulation of selected parameter values for Ra (Fig.1).

While our direct numerical simulation shows aXisyInmetriC solutions, [4] showed that m 7E 0
is the stable state. These convective states can be calculated by longterm simulations or by
starting from zero (see section rotating ease below), but can also be found by use of path
following methods, presented by [5]. Here we realized numerical simulation lasting several
multiples of thermal diffusive time 7th : dZ/KL. During experiment runs scientiﬁc wait—up time
for stable states is set to one thermal diffusive time 7th. For prediction of experiment scenario
that means, that just increasing temperature difference and waiting only one 7th as a minimum
requirement for expecting stable states, during this loop 1 only aXisyInmetriC state is expected
to be investigated.

3.2. Rotating case

Second loop of experimental run starts With setting Rayleigh number, Taylor number is set to
zero at the beginning. Solutions for this show, that starting With zero start solution (corresp.
to increasing Rayleigh number from zero to Chosen value), m 7E 0 mode is the stable state
immediatly (Fig. 2). Thermal impulse seems to be more effective than the small perturbations
by increasing Ra With small step size as in loop 1. So during loop 2 convective states as described
in [4] are observable.

Regarding stability curves for Ra : f (Ta), already shown also in [6], superposition of rotation
corresponds to special traverse of these curves from irregular to steady convective states (Fig. 3,
from left to right). Simulation in low and medium region of rotation conﬁrm this behaviour
(Fig. 4).

4. Conclusion

We presented numerical preliminary studies for microgravity experiment ’GeoFlow’ on thermal
convection in rotating spherical shells. Analog to an automatic experimental run simulations
are done for non—rotating and rotating ease. Rich dynamics of this spherical Rayleigh—Be’nard
problem under a central dielectrophoretio force in microgravity environment can be investigated.

During loop 1 (non—rotating ease) transition from basic Via steady to irregular ﬂow is shown.
Onset of time—dependenoe still has to be resolved With much more dense steps in Rayleigh
