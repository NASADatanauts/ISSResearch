Food analysis in the micromolar range and with high sensitive limits of detection. In particular, atrazine, prometryn
and diuron were detected with a limit of detection of 0.5 nM, 0.31 nM and 0.48 nM, respectively; glucose
and lactose were revealed with a limit of detection of 8.5 MM and 90 MM, respectively; catechol was
identiﬁed with a limit of detection of 1 MM. Based on the comparative performance of laboratory set—up
techniques and MBA biosensor, the multi—biosensor platform emerged as a suitable tool for large classes
of compounds in fast, simple screening in agrifood quality.
