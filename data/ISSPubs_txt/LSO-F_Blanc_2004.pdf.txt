[1] The experiment LSO (Lightning and Sprite Observations) is dedicated to the optical
study, from the International Space Station, of sprites occurring in the upper atmosphere
above thunderstorms. The objectives were to study these phenomena and to validate a
new measurement concept for future measurements of sprites from space at the nadir. The
ﬁrst measurements were performed in the frame of the ﬂight of the French Astronaut
Claudie Haigneré (mission Andromede) in October 2001. Observations were performed
by two miorooameras, one in the Visible and near—infrared and the other equipped with
a moderately wide band ﬁlter at 761 nm. This ﬁlter includes the most intense N2 1P
emission of the sprites and partly the oxygen absorption A band of the atmosphere. The
light emissions from sprites occurring in the middle and upper atmosphere are then
differentiated from the emissions from lightning, occurring more deeply in the atmosphere
and then more absorbed. This paper presents the ﬁrst observations of sprites from
space at the nadir and statistics about the respective intensities of lightning and sprites
emissions as observed with this experiment. INDEX TERMS: 3324 Meteorology and
