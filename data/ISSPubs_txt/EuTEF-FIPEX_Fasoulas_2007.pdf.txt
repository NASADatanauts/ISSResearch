Astrodynamics and Technological Aspects of Astrobiology
Missions in Our Solar System
Stefanos Fasoulas and Tina Schmiel

The Chapter gives an introduction into some basic technological

aspects related to space missions in general and to astrobiology

missions to other planets, asteroids, comets, arid/or moons in

particular. We focus on explaining the payload mass limits and the

speciﬁc constraints given by orbital mechanics.
7.1
Introduction
Space missions are associated with many different applications, e.g., telecommu-
nication, navigation, Earth observation, planetary exploration, and, very often,
manned spaceﬂight. In the past few years, another discipline, namely, astrobiol-
ogy, has become more and more important. Today, many scientiﬁc space missions
are especially dedicated to tackling astrobiological questions. The opportunities of
space missions in low Earth orbit (LEO), by using space-based telescopes or by
exploring in situ the planets (see Chapter 12), moons, and other bodies in our Solar
System, provide unique possibilities for all scientists seeking a deeper understand-
ing of the origin and nature of life. Thus, the community of scientists from other
disciplines that formerly were not necessarily linked to the space sciences is
continuously increasing.

In the meanwhile, astrobiology missions are much diversiﬁed, using different
experiments in LEO, space-based telescopes, different landing probes, satellites
orbiting other planets, and, possibly in the very near future, sample return mis-
sior1s from different locations in our Solar System. All these missions have their
speciﬁc constraints, but they also have some common boundary conditions. There-
fore, this chapter will concentrate on some selected basic boundary conditions for
space missions, especially for the reader who is not familiar with space engineer-
ing. One main focus is to understand what space engineers mean when they talk
about a required velocity Change AV to realize a particular mission, or about payload

and structure fractions, and why they are always worried about each gram of a
mission.

Probably everyone has the feeling that the mass budget of a space mission is
critical, but why is this so? This shall be explained by the basic rocket equation.
Then some basics of orbital mechanics will be discussed, followed by a brief
introduction into orbital maneuvers. Finally, in order to illustrate our general
ﬁndings, missions to Mars will be brieﬂy addressed.

7.2
The Rocket Equation
7.2.1
Single-staged Rockets
The original derivation of the rocket equation is attributed to Konstantin Tsioll<0V-
sl<y (1857—1935), a Russian schoolteacher (Fig. 7.1). The Tsioll<ovsl<y rocket equa-
tion, which is simply the result of the momentum conservation equation for a
single-staged rocket, states that the Characteristic velocity change AVCh of a rocket is
proportional to the velocity of the exhaust gases Ce multiplied with the logarithm of
the initial total mass m0 divided by the ﬁnal, end-of—bum mass mb:

The structure mass (mSthmre) comprises the mass of all needed subsystems of a
rocket, e.g. the tanks, thrusters, pumps, pipes, sensors, and other subsystems. The
payload mass (mpayload) essentially comprises the scientiﬁc instruments of a mis-
sion plus all equipment supporting these instruments. Now, by deﬁning a struc-

Table 7.1 shows that typical values for the structure fractions of chemical rockets
are below 10%. Based on this relation, Fig. 7.2 shows the resulting payload
fractions for different structure fractions as a function of AVCh / Ce. Now, in order
to illustrate the meaning of a structure fraction 0 = 5—10%, let us consider an
example from biology. What is the structure fraction of an egg, which means, what
is the shell mass related to the total egg mass?

stage, and launch acceleration ofthree different rocket types

In a non-representative experiment the author performed for a lecture in Dres-
den, it turned out that the average structure fraction of six free-range eggs was
about 11 % of the total mass. Certainly, an eggshell is not made of the strongest

material that could be provided by nature, but, on the other hand, it usually does
not have to withstand accelerations of up to several g’s, extreme Vibratior1s, high
internal temperatures and pressures, aggressive and explosive fuel compounds,
and so forth. This ﬁgurative example of an egg may give an impression of how
thin and fragile rockets must be, having only about half the structure fraction of
an egg.

Indeed, some rocket structures are so thin that they would buckle under their
own weight as soon as they are put upright. How is this done, then? First the fuel is
put into the tanks under a higher pressure and then the rocket is put upright. The
tanks serve simultaneously as the skin structure of the rocket, and therefore the
internal fuel pressure stabilizes the rocket.

As a matter of fact, the results of Eq. (6) as depicted in Fig. 7.2 show that, even for
a very ambitious structure fraction of about 5 %, the characteristic velocity change
would be lower than 2.8 times the effective exhaust velocity if some payload, let’s
say of about 1 % of the total mass, is assumed:

AVCh’maX g 2.8 - Ce for o = 0.05 and u = 0.01 (7.7).
The situation is of course worse for a higher structure fraction. On the other hand,
the effective exhaust velocity Ce depends on the total energy in the combustion
Chamber of a rocket, which is given for chemical rocl<etpropellar1ts mainly by the
heat of formation AhR, e.g., for liquid hydrogen (LHZ) and liquid oxygen (LOX) as
propellant, by

LH2 + LOX : H20 + AhR (7.8)

Ce,max,ideal : m (7H9)
Subsequently, the heat of formation must be chosen as high as possible in order to
achieve a high exhaust velocity. Some values for chemical compounds with the
highestl<nowr1 heat of formation are given in Table 7.2. With the exception of the
compound BN, these compounds are oxides or ﬂuorides of metals, hydrogen, or
carbon. The burning of metals in a combustion Chamber is technically not an easy
task, as they often build impermeable oxide layers that could prevent a complete
burn or could block the nozzle throat. Some of them are extremely toxic and highly
reactive and thus are very difﬁcult to store. Nevertheless, some metals as powders,
mainly aluminum, are given as energy-increasing additions to solid rocket propel-
lar1ts. Thus, practically all chemical propellants used in rocl<etry are based on
hydrogen and its compounds with carbon and nitrogen. Fluorine has never
reached an operational status because of its high reactivity. Thus, only oxygen
and its compounds are used as oxidizers.

Of course, the ideal value for the velocity of the exhaust gases Ce cannot be reached
because of internal losses in the thrusters. When expanding the propellants
through a nozzle into a vacuum, for the hydrogen—oxygen combination a value
of about 4—4.5 km s‘1 can be achieved, corresponding to an efﬁciency of about
75 %. Additionally, when launching from the ground, Ce is further limited to about
3—3.4 km s‘l. Thus, one can calculate the AV limit for single-staged rockets to about
9—10km s‘l. It will be shown later that this is the minimum value needed to get a
satellite into a low Earth orbit.
7.2.2
Multiple-staged Rockets
The solution to obtaining a higher AV, the staging concept, is based on the idea of
continuously jettisoning structure mass that is not needed anymore, e.g. thrusters,
tanks, boosters, and payload fairing. The describing equation is then

multipIe-staged rockets; index in Oi gives the number of stages,
e.g., 01 for 1-stage rocket, 02 for 2-stage rocket, etc. The names
give examples ofdifferent rockets launched.
Thus, the overall AV can be increased as depicted in Fig. 7.3. Indeed, AV could be
increased almost linearly with increasing number of stages. However, in this case
the payload fraction is decreased exponentially (notice that the payload fraction is
depicted on a logarithmic scale in Fig. 7.3). Thus, for multiple-staged rockets AV is
limited if a payload fraction of at least 0.1 % is assumed.

Orbital Mechanics and Astrodynamics
7.3.1
Some Historical Notes
The description of planetary motion has Challenged scientists for many centuries.
The early Greeks believed that celestial bodies moved in circles around the Earth.
At that time this idea was in excellent agreement with observations for all distant
stars. However, some of the observed bodies had a somewhat strange motion.
Sometimes they moved backward and forward in the celestial sphere reference.
Thus, they were called planets, from the Greek word for “wanderer” or “nomad.”
This geocentric universe model probably reached its peak of reﬁnement around the

year 140 with Ptolemaeus (85—165), who calculated the orbits of the planets using
various combinations of circles known as epicycles.

It took almost 1 500 years before Nicolaus Copernicus (1473—1543) placed the
Sun at the center of the Solar System, with the Earth rotating on its axis once a day
while moving around the Sun once a year. However, Copernicus still believed that
a planetary orbit should be Circular, and his geometry was therefore as complex as
that of Ptolemaeus. It was Johannes Kepler (1571—1630) who, based on the precise
observations of Tycho Brahe (1546—1601), discovered and formulated the laws of
planetary motion that are known today as Kepler’s laws (Fig. 7.4).

Kepler’s First Law: The planets orbit the Sun in elliptical orbits with the Sun at one

focus.

Kepler’s Second Law: The line connecting a planet to the Sim sweeps out equal areas

in equal amounts of time.

Kepler’s Third Law: The time requiredfor a planet to orbit the Sim, called its period, is

proportional to the long axis of the ellipse raised to the 3/2 power.
The constant of proportionality is the samefor all the planets.

However, Kepler could not explain physically what forces were responsible for
these laws. This explanation was provided by Isaac Newton (1642—1727). He
published his three laws of motion and the law of universal gravitation in the
Principia in 1687, stating the following:

Newton’s First Law of Motion: A body stays at rest or moves with a constant
velocity on a straight line unless acted upon
by an external imbalanced force.

Newton’s Second Law of Motion: An applied force is equal to the time rate of
change of momentum.

Newton’s Third Law of Motion: All forces occur in pairs, and these two forces
are equal in magnitude and opposite in di-
rection.

Newton’s Universal Law of Gravitation: The force of gravity between two bodies is
directly proportional to the product of their
masses and inversely proportional to the
square of the distance between them.

These laws explain why a satellite, a moon, or a planet stays in orbit around the
Earth, a planet, or the Sun, respectively. Very often it is argued that the gravitational
force is counterbalanced by a centrifugal force. This is easy to understand but is
physically incorrect, because according to Newton’s ﬁrst law of motion the body
should then maintain a constant velocity on a straight line, which is obviously not
the case.

The correct answer is that gravity forces the satellite to fall towards the Earth;
however, because of its velocity it will never touch the Earth’s surface, meaning that
the satellite is in a continuous free fall “around” the Earth. Today, it is known,
thanks to Albert Einstein (1879—1955), that even this answer is not the complete
truth. According to Einstein’s theory of relativity, the answer should be that gravity
mass causes a curvature in space-time, in which the satellite is caused to move.

By combining Newton’s second law of motion with his universal law of grav-
itation, an equation is obtained for the satellite’s acceleration vector 17 if it is
assumed that gravity of only one central point mass is the only force:

This equation is called the “two-body equation of motion,” giving the motion of a
satellite’s position vector 17 in his orbit. A solution to this equation is the polar
equation of a conic section:

r = ¥ (7.15),
1 + ecos G
where a is the semi-major axis, 6 is the eccentricity, and 9 is the so-called true
anomaly, an angle measured from the closest point of the orbit to the current
position (see also Fig. 7.4). A conic section is a curve formed by cutting a plane
through a right circular cone, as illustrated in Fig. 7.5. The angular orientation of
the cutting plane determines whether the conic section is a circle, ellipse, parabola,
or hyperbola.
7.3.2
The Energy Conservation Equation
In order to illustrate the physical meaning of the possible orbits, another equation
that also can be derived from the two-body equation of motion can be used, the so-
called “Vis-Viva” or “energy conservation equation”:

where e is the total mass-speciﬁc mechanical energy of the satellite and v is the
magnitude of the velocity. The term for the potential energy deﬁnes the potential
energy as zero at inﬁnity and negative at any radius less than inﬁnity (Fig. 7.6).
Using this deﬁnition, the speciﬁc mechanical energy of elliptical and circular orbits
is always negative, and a velocity at inﬁnite distance to the central body mass
cannot be deﬁned. As the energy increases and approaches zero, the semi-major

axis of the ellipse gets larger and larger, approaching a parabolic orbit. The velocity
on a parabolic orbit is thus high enough to escape from the central mass, having at
inﬁnity a zero velocity relative to this mass. If the energy is further increased to
positive values, the velocity is then high enough to escape from the central mass,
having at inﬁnity a ﬁnite velocity relative to this mass, leading to hyperbolic orbits.
The orbit period P for elliptical orbits also can be derived from the energy
conservation equation as

yM
For circular orbits, the semi-major axis a simply equals the orbit radius r. (Recall
that this is just Kepler’s third law including the constant of proportionality.)
7.3.3
Some Typical Velocities
The velocity of circular orbits is given by the energy conservation equation as
WM
Vcircle : (7..18)
r
Therefore, the velocity needed to maintain a circular orbit is higher the closer the
satellite is to the central body. This is illustrated in Fig. 7.6. Notice that the curves
shown in Fig. 7.6 are not orbits in physical space but only in potential energy.
The velocity on elliptical, parabolic, or hyperbolic orbits at a certain distance from
the central mass can be calculated by

r a
Thus, the velocity reaches a maximum value for the closest orbit point and a
minimum for the most distant point of the orbit (Fig. 7.7).

Now, staying on Earth’s surface, what kind of orbits can be achieved and what
velocities are needed? Assuming a launch location on a big mountain and that the
Earth is a perfect sphere without an atmosphere, the velocity to which a satellite
must be accelerated perpendicular to Earth’s gravitational ﬁeld is simply

This value is known as the ﬁrst cosmic velocity. For slightly lower values, the
satellite would fall in an elliptical trajectory back to Earth; for higher values it would
reach an elliptical orbit around the Earth. However, if the velocity is further
increased, reaching an inﬁnite value for the semi-major axis a, then the satellite
would be on a parabola. The velocity needed for this at Earth’s surface is called the
second cosmic velocity and has a value of

estimate the necessary AV to get a satellite into orbit. Thus, for low Earth orbits, this
AV demand is about 9—10km s‘l. Figure 7.8 also illustrates that for establishing
elliptical orbits other than those going through the launching point, additional
maneuvers or burns are necessary.

7.4
Orbital Maneuvers
7.4.1
High-thrust Maneuvers
To Change a satellite’s orbit, its velocity vector in magnitude and / or direction must
be Changed. Compared to the orbital period, most chemical propulsion systems
operate for a short time only, so the maneuver can be treated as an impulsive
Change in velocity while the position is the same. Therefore, any maneuver must
occur at a point where the old orbit intersects with the new. If there is no
intersection, then an intermediate orbit must be used, which intersects both.
Generally, the Change in velocity needed to go from one orbit to another is

Ax? : \7’2 — V} (7.22).
As a ﬁrst example, an orbit Change from an Earth equatorial orbit to a polar orbit at
the same altitude is considered. The required velocity change would be

W! = 1V2 — V1! = x/ivl (7.23).

Fig. 7.10 Required Av for a Hohmann transfer ellipse between
two circular orbits.
Performing this maneuver in low Earth orbit would mean that the required AV is
ﬂvl - 7.91 km s‘1 = 11.2 km s_l. Recall that this is just the value required to
escape from Earth’s gravitation when launched from the ground! Out-of—orbital-
plane changes are therefore performed only when absolutely required.

In order to establish an orbit that is higher in altitude (e.g., a geosynchronous orbit
[GEO]) than the initial one (e.g., a LEO), another typical maneuver is performed. The
most efﬁcient direct transfer orbit is an ellipse that tangentially intersects both orbits
(Fig. 7.9). This transfer ellipse is called the Hohmann transfer orbit. The total change
in velocity required for the transfer is the sum of the velocity changes at the perigee
and apogee of the transfer ellipse. Because the velocity vectors are collinear, the
velocity changes are simply the differences in magnitudes of the velocities in each
orbit, namely, for circular initial and ﬁnal orbits:

AVI-Iohmann : AVl + AVZ : (Vellipse,1 _ Vcircle,1) + (Vcircle,2 _ Vellipse,2) (7..24)
The result of Eq. (24) is depicted in Fig. 7.10 as a function of different ratios of the
initial and ﬁnal radii. An important and somewhat surprising result is that the
required AV for a transfer between two circular orbits around the same central mass
reaches values above the required AV for escaping from gravitational attraction. This is,
for example, the case for a transfer between LEO (11130 x 6 600 km) and GEO
(76130 x 42 000 km). The reason for this is that at the ﬁrst burn the fuel mass needed
for the second burn has to be accelerated and lifted in the gravitational ﬁeld. Thus,
from an energetic point of View, it is less expensive to launch a satellite from LEO into
an interplanetary orbit than to GEO. Finally, in most cases it turns out that the

7.4.2
Low-thrust Maneuvers
It is often argued that thrusters such as electrical or ion thrusters can achieve a
much higher exhaust velocity, and therefore a higher overall velocity change AV,
than chemical rockets. This is in many cases true, although the structure fraction
would certainly be increased because of the needed additional power support.
However, the total thrust achieved is usually not sufﬁcient to allow for an appli-
cation in the ﬁrst stages of a rocket. Nevertheless, when using electrical thrusters,
e.g. as a third stage, the total AV can be increased as depicted in Fig. 7.11.

On the other hand, because of the low thrust, the operation time is also
increased, leading to the situation of having an almost inﬁnite amount of small
pulses (as approximation for a continuous long-term burn). Considering the
discussion of the previous chapter, this would lead to an increase of the required
AV to accomplish the same orbit transfer. As an example, Fig. 7.12 shows the result
for a transfer between two circular Earth orbits in comparison to the Hohmann
transfer. Thus, it is important to have not only a high AV capability of a rocket but
also a low AV requirement according to the orbit maneuvers that are possible with
the used propulsion systems. An overview of the required AV to accomplish a
certain mission is given in Table 7.3.

Table 7.3 illustrates that the AV requirements for space missions are very high, and
therefore — according to the Tsiolkovsky equation — the resulting payload fractions
are very low. This is especially the case for interplanetary missions to the outer
planets of our Solar System.

Fortunately, there is an alternative that allows for increasing a vehicle’s energy
(and therefore velocity) relative to the Sun without requiring fuel: the “gravity-
assist” or “swing-by” maneuver. This maneuver uses a planet’s gravitational ﬁeld
and orbital velocity to “sling” the satellite, Changing its velocity in magnitude and
direction (Fig. 7.13). As the satellite enters the gravitational ﬁeld on a hyperbolic
orbit and passes behind the planet, the planet pulls it in the direction of the planet’s
motion. Thus, it gains energy with respect to the Sun, altering the satellite’s
original orbit around the Sun. If the satellite passes in front of a planet, it is pulled
in the opposite direction, causing a slowdown in velocity relative to the Sun. Of
course, because of Newton’s laws (action — reaction) the same energy change
occurs for the planet as well. However, because of the signiﬁcantly smaller mass
of the satellite, the effect on the satellite can be extreme, whereas for the planet it is
negligible.

Gravity-assist trajectories often make the difference between possible and im-
possible missions. For example, the Galileo mission to Jupiter was launched
towards the inner Solar System, performing ﬁrst one swing-by maneuver at Venus
followed by two subsequent swing-by maneuvers at Earth. Another example is the
Ulysses probe, which performed a gravity-assist maneuver at Jupiter that sent it out
of the ecliptic plane into a polar orbit around the Sun.

Of course, in order to establish such maneuvers, the constellation between the
Earth, the gravity-assist planet, and the target planet must be in accordance. This

"

often determines possible “launch windows,” meaning the time frame in which
the spacecraft has to be launched.
Finally, it is important to note that in both cases, either acceleration or deceler-
ation of the satellite relative to the Sun, it leaves the planet’s sphere of inﬂuence on
a hyperbolic orbit (relative to the planet!). Thus, in order to establish an orbit
around a planet, an impulse (thrust), and therefore fuel, is again required.
7.5
Example: Missions to Mars
In the following sections, some of the general ﬁndings from the previous chapters
will be discussed regarding missions to our neighboring planet Mars. First, in order
to establish an interplanetary trajectory to Mars, the satellite should be launched
with a velocity higher than 1 1.2 km s‘1 (the escape velocity from the Earth) relative to
Earth. Further, it should be launched in the direction of the Earth’s motion around
the Sun; otherwise, the AV requirement would be increased by the Earth’s own
velocity around the Sun of about 29.8 km s‘l. For a launch to Mars, often the Earth’s
own rotational velocity is also used, i.e., a launch towards the east and additionally
during nighttime is performed (assuming a direct launch from Earth’s surface and
an injection into a Hohmann transfer). As already discussed, the most energy-
efﬁcient transfer trajectory is a Hohmann transfer joining Earth and Mars’ orbit
around the Sun. Ofcourse, as soon as the satellite’s orbit intersects with the Martian
orbit, the planet should be at this position in order to set up a “rendezvous.” A certain
initial constellation between the two planets is therefore needed, as seen in Fig. 7.14.

"
"18","196 l 7 Astrodynamics and Technological Aspects ofAstrobio/ogy Missions in Our Solar System
All these issues deﬁne the launch window, which opens for just a few days or weeks
and is additionally restricted in local time. If the window is missed, the next
opportunity occurs after about 780 days.

Because of the limited payload fraction of the launch vehicle, the amount of fuel
carried with the probe is limited, too. Thus, only a few minor interplanetary
correction maneuvers (usually about four or ﬁve) are possible in order to adjust
the orbit for a typical journey of about 500 000 000 km. The main fuel portion is then
needed to slow down the spacecraft to a mostly high eccentric orbit around Mars,
except, of course, if a direct landing without a prior velocity change is planned.

Many of the orbital missions to Mars performed in the last few years make use of
so-called “aerobraking” maneuvers to establish a ﬁnal orbit. Therefore, the closest
point (periapsis) to the planet is Chosen so that the spacecraft ﬂies through the
upper part of the atmosphere, which causes aerodynamic drag and further slows
down the spacecraft, and subsequently its apoapsis (most distant orbital point). The
effect on the apoapsis is higher than that on the periapsis, and after performing
this aerodynamic break over several passages, an orbit with a lower eccentricity is
achieved. Finally, a small burn at the apoapsis lifts the periapsis out of the
atmosphere and the ﬁnal orbit is established.

Again, the necessary fuel mass for the braking maneuvers together with the
required satellite system mass, (e.g., energy, attitude, and orbit control; commu-
nication; thrusters; tanks), signiﬁcantly limits scientiﬁc instrument mass. The
situation is similar for entry and landing probes where some of the fuel necessary
for orbit insertion can be saved, but additional system mass must be introduced,
e.g., for the heat shield.

Because the scientiﬁc payload for interplanetary missions is so restricted in mass
(and also in energy demand), an alternative to studying the planets or their surface
material is to bring material from other celestial bodies, especially from Mars, to
Earth for further in-depth investigations. Therefore, some basic boundary condi-
tions and scenarios for a Mars sample return (MSR) mission will be discussed here
(see Figs. 7.15 to 7.17). A more detailed discussion is provided by D. Boden and S.
Hoffmann in H uman Spaceflight: Mission Analysis and Design, edited by W. Larson
and L. Pranke (1999).

The ﬁrst part of an MSR mission, the way to Mars on a minimum energy transfer,
has already been discussed. Assume that the spacecraft is already in a Mars orbit and
is supplied with some material from the Mars surface that has been collected by use
of a landing probe. Similar to the outbound part, it has to wait until the constellation
between Mars and Earth allows for a return ﬂight trajectory. For low-energy trans-
fers, the Mars stay-time may reach values of more than one Earth year. Adding the
transfer times, the total mission duration lasts for more than 2.5 years. The required
AV for the return injection is lower than for the trans-Mars injection; however, one
has to recall that with current technologies the necessary fuel mass must be
imported to Mars. As shown in Fig. 7.15, for the low-energy transfer from a LEO
to a Mars orbit and a direct ﬂight back to Earth, a AV of about 8.2 km s‘1 is needed.
The AV needed for a launch from Earth, the AV for a launch from the Mars surface
(about 4 km S4), and the AV for any rendezvous or trajectory correction maneuvers

must be added to this value. Thus, even assuming a direct landing upon Earth
return, which is extremely challenging because of the high return velocity, the
overall AV needed for such a mission is in the best case about 20km s‘l. This
high overall AV value yields extremely low payload fractions, which could be returned
to Earth (including the transfer vehicle with heat shield and other items).
Using fast, high-thrust transfers as depicted in Fig. 7.16 is not really an alter-
native for reducing the overall mission time, because the waiting time for the

return launch window is enlarged. Thus, only a small amount of the return ﬂight

time can be saved. However, the required AV is dramatically increased, easily

reaching values above 25 km S4.

What about using gravity-assist maneuvers? This possibility exists, as illustrated
in Fig. 7.17. The alternative of performing a swing-by maneuver at Venus could
shorten the overall mission time, while the total AV requirement would be much
lower than the high-thrust transfer, but nevertheless higher than a double low-
energy Hohmann transfer (Fig. 7.15). However, the spacecraft would ﬂy Closer to
the Sun than the orbit of Venus, which subsequently has an impact on the overall
design, and especially on the thermal control system because of the higher solar
radiation.

From this brief discussion of potential Mars sample return mission scenarios it
becomes obVious that orbital mechanics provide a variety of possibilities. However,
it is also obVious that generally only very small payload fractions can be realized and
that each scenario has some speciﬁc beneﬁts and drawbacks. In addition, techno-
logical issues not addressed here in detail must be taken into account, such as
power supply, data processing, and communication requirements; automated
guidance; navigation and control; system autonomy; entry, descent, and landing
technologies; robotics and mechanisms; propulsion, etc. Thus, the payload mass
used to calculate the payload mass ratio of a rocket (see Section 7.2) includes all
spacecraft subsystems that are needed for survival and control of the science
payload. Table 7.4 gives an overview of the subsystems of a spacecraft that are
required to service the science payload.

Finally, for potential biological payloads, planetary protection requirements, as
discussed in Chapter 13, must be added, making the situation even more complex
and challenging, but not unsolvable.
