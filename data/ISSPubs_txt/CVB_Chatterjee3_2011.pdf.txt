§ The Constrained Vapor Bubble (CVB) experiment was run in the microgravity
:5 environment of the International Space Station as part of the Increment 23-24 Which ended
E} in September 2010. Here we present preliminary results Which indicate signiﬁcant
2 differences in the operation of the CVB heat pipe in the micro-gravity environment as
§ compared to the Earth's gravity. The temperature proﬁle data along the heat pipe indicate
2“ that the heat pipe behavior is affected favorably by increased capillary ﬂow and adversely
5.; by the absence of convective heat transfer as a heat loss mechanism. Image data of the liquid
g proﬁle in the grooves of the heat pipe indicate that the curvature gradient is considerably
910; different from that on Earth. An initial discussion of the data collected is presented.

g I. Introduction
E ’ I |HE Constrained Vapor Bubble (CVB) experiment is the ﬁrst experiment run on the Fluids Integrated Rack
3 (FIR) aboard the Destiny module of the International Space Station (188). As part of the Fluids and Combustion
Facility (FCF), the obj ective of the experiment was to study the fundamental ﬂuid mechanics and heat transfer in an
ideal grooved heat pipe in the microgravity environment. The experiment is signiﬁcant because it has multiple scales
involved in its operation. The macroscopic scale or the “Engineering Scale” is concerned With the functioning of the
CVB as an ideal grooved heat pipe. Here the length scales are on the order of millimeters and the physics at this
scale is affected by gravity and the Bond number, Bomm, is on the order of 0.1 on earth

region of the corner meniscus present in the groove of the heat pipe. Here the length scales are of the order of
microns and the Bond number, Boy on earth is

A schematic of the CVB heat pipe is shown in Figure l. The quartz cuvette constrains the vapor bubble from all
sides such that there is a liquid phase always separating the vapor phase from the solid phase. The cuvette is partially
ﬁlled With a perfectly wetting liquid - pentane in this case. The liquid forms a pool at one end. In the earth’s gravity
condition, this is the end closer to the ground, since the bubble is lighter. In microgravity the bubble should not have

5 any preference under isothermal conditions. The liquid forms four menisci at the four sharp corners of the cuvette
E and rises up due to capillary action. One end of the cuvette is heated and the other end is cooled. The liquid at the
§ hot end evaporates and this increases the vapor pressure of the vapor at that end. The vapor in contract With the
3 liquid at the cooler end has a lower pressure and thus the vapor ﬂows from the hot end to the cold end. Here it
E releases its heat of vaporization and forms liquid. Thus there is heat transfer Via mass transfer and since the latent
:- heat of most substances are high, a large amount of heat transfer can be realized using this process. The cuvette thus

3 acts like a ﬁn heat exchanger Where the effectiveness of the ﬁn is increased by 1ncreas1ng the conduct1V1ty of the ﬁn
g material.
g Devices that are essentially a CVB have been studied by various researches as micro heat pipes. Cotter presented a
g steady state model that gave the variation in curvature as a function of the local heat ﬂuX. Babin et al.1 did an
EL experimental investigation of a trapezoidal micro-heat pipe and built a model to determine its capillary limit, which
E is the maximum heat input to the heat pipe before the capillary pressure becomes insufﬁcient for pumping up the
g ﬂuid. Ha and Peterson2 were able to obtain an analytical expression for the prediction of the dryout point, Which is
1;“ the location of the dried out region, in V shaped micro heat pipe grooves as a function of the applied heat ﬂux.
5.? KhrustaleV and Faghri3 gave a detailed solution for the heat transfer in the evaporator and condenser and the aXial
g ﬂuid ﬂow in the corners for a triangular micro heat pipe. Longtin et al.4 solved niass, momentum and energy
9%; conservation to develop a model in one dimension. Ma et al.5 studied the effect of the shear at the liquid-vapor
g interface on the ﬂow in the corner meniscus. KhrustaleV and Faghri6 presented a model that took into account
é surface roughness and the conduction in the solid of the capillary groove. Peterson and Ma7 developed a model that
5 took into account correction in ﬂow due to the shear at the liquid-vapor interface. Later Peterson and Ha8 presented
a a simpler approach by assuming the. radius of the liquid varies linearly With distance. Bowman and Moss 9 used a
'5 lumped 1ns1de heat transfer coefﬁCIent for the heat pipe and compared 1ts efﬁ01ency to that of a standard ﬁn.
é Recently Suman et al.10 have created a model for a “V” grooved regular polygonal heat pipe geometry.
$0 The curvature under non-isothernial conditions is different from that of the isothermal (equilibrium) interface
E curvature because of the phase change in the evaporating section. The interface curvature dynamically adjusts to
@ create a pressure gradient that Will allow the liquid to be pumped up the corner. The gradient is such that there is
'5? enough liquid left at the top for evaporation, failing Which the heat pipe reaches its performance limit (the capillary
‘2: limit) and dryout is said to have occurred. Thus an unknown factor in many theoretical studies is the interface
'5 curvature. The experimental technique developed by Wayner and co-workers ﬁlled this gap by providing this
3 unknown. The interferometry technique gives bulk curvature 11 Which provides the most Vital clue to the puzzle.
E With the curvature known, the liquid pressure gradient along the axial direction can be calculated and thus the ﬂuid
Li ﬂow can be derived. Since the differential amount of ﬂuid is the amount being evaporated, With the knowledge of
g: the ﬂow derived from the curvature data, the heat transfer can be calculated. This forms the corner stone of our
research.

EL Wayner and co—workers have studied the CVB experimentally using a cuvette with a relatively large inside
2 cross—section (3 mm X 3mm) and developed models to solve for the ﬂuid ﬂow and heat transfer processes occurring
é in the bulk meniscus. Huang 12 developed models for the CVB in the microgravity environment as well as the
S“ earth’s environment. He studied the effect of heat load on the curvature of the corner meniscus for a cell tilted with
5-; the vertical. Basu 13 did a series of careful experiments with empty and ﬁlled cells to determine the effect of phase
<3 change heat transfer in this speciﬁc setup. She calculated the fraction of radiative and convective losses and also did
91”; preliminary drop tower tests to determine the effect of zero gravity on the shape of the constrained bubble. Wang 14
g developed an iterative model to calculate the average inside heat transfer coefﬁcient for the evaporator section that
$5 takes into account certain experimental observations like the measured temperature proﬁle and ﬁnal curvature at the
5 top. Huang15 obtained an analytical expression for the variation of curvature with the temperature data measured
go experimentally for microgravity conditions.
""9: In this paper we present data in the earth's gravity and microgravity environment from the CVB experiment that
1:30 ﬂew to the International Space Station on STS 128 in August 2009. We present, for the ﬁrst time, high resolution
i image data of the inside surface of the cuvette at isothermal and non—isothermal conditions. Temperature data along
§ the axis of the cuvette was also collected and will be presented ﬁrst. Finally a model will be developed to match the
3 temperature data and corner meniscus curvature.

g? A. The FIR / LMM /CVB Assembly
g The Fluids and Combustion Facility aboard the consists of two International Standard Payload Racks one of
8 which is the Fluids Integrated Rack (Figure 3). The center piece of the FIR is the optics bench on which the Light
Microscopy Module (LMM) is mounted. The LMM is an optical microscope capable of high resolution color and
monochrome microscopy, bright ﬁeld, dark ﬁeld, phase contrast, differential interference contrast (DIC),
ﬂuorescence, spectrophotometer, and confocal microscopy. It is a modiﬁed Leica RXA microscope which can be
operated from Earth. The various subsystems present in the FIR are the
0 Structural Subsystem
0 Environmental Subsystem
0 Gas Interface Subsystem
0 Electrical Subsystem
0 Command and Data Management Subsystem

American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics

"
"5","Of these the most important from the perspective of CVB operations is the Command and Data Management
Subsystem (CDMS). It consists of Input Output Processor (IOP), the Image Processing and Storage Unit (IPSU), the
Fluids Science AVionics Package (FSAP) and the Mass Data Storage Unit (MDSU/IOP). The IOP provides the link
to the FIR Via the Ethernet, analog Video and High Rate Data Link. It receives and stores the experimental data and
downlinks it to the Earth. The FIR can accommodate two IPSUs. The IPSU interfaces With the cameras on the LMM
and captures, processes and stores the images. The FSAP provides the primary control mechanism for the
experiment. By issuing commands that control the various actuators and motors on the rack. It can also issue
commands to IPSU, so that in conjunction, they can perform a complete experiment.
B. Experiment Overview and Test Matrix
Detains of the experimental setup are presented in Chatterjee et al.16 and Will not be repeated here. A brief
5 overview is given for continuity. The experimental system consists of a quartz cuvette (see Figure 1) Which is
a 5.5 X 5.5 mm and 37 mm long. The inside channel is 3 X 3 mm and is closed at one end. A heater attached to this end
5, acts as the heat source. The other end is attached to a cold ﬁnger Which intern is attached to Thermo Electric Coolers
g embedded in a cold plate (Figure 4). The temperature of the cold end can be ﬁxed to a predetermined value and the
g» net power supplied to the heater is also known. Thermocouples embedded into the surface of the quartz can measure
2 the temperature proﬁle With very high accuracy.
(2 The system is partially ﬁlled With the working ﬂuid - pentane. In the Earth's gravitational ﬁeld, the pentane
:0 forms a liquid pool at one end and rises up the four corners due to capillary action. Since the cuvette is constructed
§ out of quartz, the microscope can be used to capture images of the inside surface of the cuvette. By capturing images
g in a grid pattern the entire inside surface of the cuvette can be mapped and a composite image can be generated. This
if is used to generate a very detailed ﬂuid ﬂow proﬁle on the inside of the cuvette.

L; Since two very different scales are involved in the functioning of the CVB heat pipe, image data is captured at
g: these two scales. A summary of the test matrix is provided in Table l. The “Engineering Run” seeks to collect image
data of one corner of the cuvette at low magniﬁcation but in its entirety. These images were captured at
10X magniﬁcation With multiple images at each aXial location (such that the entire meniscus is Visible after stitching
the images) With enough axial locations to capture the entire Visible inside surface of the cuvette. This data along
With the temperature and pressure readings can be used to obtain an engineer’s level understanding of the working
of the CVB as a Wickless heat pipe. The “Science Run” consists of collecting the image data of the same cuvette at
the same conditions as the engineering run. On earth, the axial locations were the same as that for the engineering
10 3 images required at 10X magniﬁcation With sufﬁcient overlap between consecutive images to allow stitching
algorithm to work.
11 6 images required at 50X magniﬁcation With sufﬁcient overlap between consecutive images to allow stitching

"
"6","run, in space eight locations were chosen due to time constraints. The images are captured at 50X magniﬁcation.
Since it is not possible to predict the location of the meniscus, multiple images were captured at each aXial location
and these were stitched together to form a composite image such that the meniscus is present in one of the frames
captured or spans across two or more of the images. Two types of runs are performed during each kind of run -
isothermal and non-isothermal. During the isothermal run, the heater and cooler circuits are turned off and the image
data is captured. Temperature and pressure data collected during this run serve to assure that the cuvette is
isothermal. After this the cooler is set to a constant temperature and the heater is stepped up. After steady state is
reached, temperature and pressure data is collected along with the imaging data - 10X or 50X depending on the type
of run.
A typical run, thus, consists of an isothermal run followed by non-isothermal runs. On earth the bubble tends to
stay in the quartz cuvette and was located towards the top of the heater due to buoyancy. In space however, the
h bubble does not experience a body force and can be located anywhere. In fact, the bubble was not within the quartz
a cuvette when the 30 mm was initially installed on the space station. However, by using a combination of heating at
g one end using the heater and cooling at the other, a bubble was nucleated inside the quartz portion.
g Thirteen sessions were run in space and siX were run on earth (two of which are planned once the module is
3: returned to earth). The sessions are summarized in Table 2 . The space operations ran continuously for about 236
§ hours (9.8 days) and consumed about 152 kWh of energy and generated about 20 GBytes of data in 12,000 ﬁles.

C. Temperature and Image data acquisition
The temperature data acquired during the experiment has a high accuracy and extraordinary temporal and spatial
resolution. While the temperature data was collected to complement the image data, it in itself can be used to gain
insight into the functioning of a heat pipe in the earth’s gravity and micro gravity environments from the heat
transfer perspective.

"7","D. Remote Operations

The experiment was remotely performed from the NASA Glenn Research Center’s Telescience Support Center
(TSC). The runs were performed by using scripts that were uploaded to the FSAP and which performed the
experiments and acquired and stored the data. A typical script performs the following functions

1. Opens an experiment - creates the necessary ﬁle structure in the computers to collect the data

2. Ramps the heater to its set point

3. Waits for steady state based on ﬁve selected thermocouple, the pressure and thermoelectric cooler current
readings while collecting temperature and pressure data at a reduced rate of data capture.

4. When steady state is achieved (based on the ﬂuctuation of three thermocouple readings and the pressure
reading), the temperature and pressure data acquisition rate is increased. Image data is captured by moving
the module according to the required locations and directing the IPSU to capture an image. In case of the

h 10X run the locations are such that there is overlap between subsequent images. In case of the 50X run, the

3 locations where fringes were likely to be present are read from a ﬁle.

g 5. The data from the FSAP and IPSU are assembled in the IOP and transmitted to earth.

% In case of the oscillation experiments Video images were captured at interesting locations after looking at live

E A. Temperature and Pressure

Figure 5 shows the temperature proﬁle of the 30 mm module in the earth’s gravity environment and in Figure 6

shows the proﬁle in the microgravity environment at the same heater input. First, one can conclude that for all most
all the heater settings, the CVB is able to better cool the heater in space than on earth since the heater end
temperature is lower. Also, the proﬁles are remarkable different. While on earth there is no section where the cuvette
has a ﬂat temperature proﬁle, in space there is a large section where the temperature remains constant.

The high spatial resolution of the data allows one to calculate the temperature gradient. The temperature

gradients for the earth’s gravity and micro gravity environments are shown in Figure 7 and Figure 8 respectively.
The temperature gradient at the heater and cooler ends allows one to determine the energy ﬂow into the system and
the heat conducted out of the system. A change in the slope of the temperature gradient indicates a change in
conductivity or heat loss mechanism. For example in Figure 7 there is a change in slope at the location denoted by
the circles.

"8","The pressure measured by the pressure transducer is the pressure of the vapor phase of the heat pipe. It is
expected that the pressure of the vapor remains fairly constant inside and it is close to the vapor pressure of pentane
at the condensation region since the vapor is in equilibrium With the liquid at this temperature. The vapor pressure of
pentane is given by

B
10 P = A — — 3
gm ( ) (T + C) ( )
Where A, B and C are constants and T is the temperature in OC. The condensation region begins at the location of the
change of slope of the temperature gradient. Indeed, the vapor pressure of pentane corresponding to the temperature
5 at this location compares very well With the pressure measured by the transducer as shown in Figure 9 and Figure
g 10. Note that the heat pipe operates at a much higher pressure in space than on earth. This is because the temperature
2' 0f the condenser region is higher. In space the only heat loss mechanism is radiation, thus the condenser portion of
{3 the heat pipe needs to operate at a higher temperature to maintain a larger temperature difference With the

g C. Composite Proﬁles in Earth’s Gravity
8 Figure 13 shows the 30 mm module in Earth’s gravity. As before the various zones can be identiﬁed. The

beginning of the condenser region lay within the region that was imaged by the 10X mapping and it can be seen
shifting slowly towards the heater end in the images for the heater power input 0.80 W to 1.60 W.

The composite image for the 1.2 watt heater input shows some discontinuities which occur due to meniscus
oscillations. Depending on whether the meniscus was in its receded or advanced position when the particular frame
of the mapping was captured, the meniscus appears discontinuous. The presence of the oscillations were later
conﬁrmed using 50X imaging at a particular location and capturing the Video.

The condenser region started at approximately at the 23 mm location which is very close to the location
determined from the temperature measurements. Also, as with the 20 mm, the drop migrated to the cooler end with
increasing heater power.

E shows the radius comparison in which the discontinuity due to the presence of the central drop is Visible near the 15
'5 mm axial location. The radius from the model passes through the experimental value. This was possible with a r0

compare well.

Figure 17 is the pressure and velocity from the model. The pressure in the vapor shown in Figure 17 (a) remains
almost constant as expected from the huge vapor volume and very little Viscous losses and almost no hydrostatic
losses. The liquid pressure is lower near the heater end indicating the direction of the liquid ﬂow.
Figure 17 (b) shows the velocity proﬁle in the liquid and vapor phase. The sign of the velocity indicates the
direction, thus the liquid is ﬂowing in the -Ve x direction while the vapor is ﬂowing from the heater to the cooler
end. The velocities are in the mm/sec range signifying that liquid covers the length of the cuvette in ~10 seconds.

While the temperature agrees much better. Also the beginning of the condenser region also correlates very well With
the experimental observation. It is interesting to note that the unique shape of the temperature proﬁle, With a ﬂat
region in the centre was replicated in the model.

Figure 19 compares the pressures and the velocities in the liquid and the vapor phases from the model. As in the
case of the Earth’s gravity case, the pressure in the vapor phase does not change by a large amount While the
pressure in the liquid phase varies more. The velocities are much larger in the vapor and liquid phase indicating that
the ﬂuid is encountering less ﬂow resistance. The ﬂuid motion seems to reverse direction near the cooler end,
indicating that the liquid may be draining away from the region. There seems to be an imperceptible dip in the liquid
pressure in Figure 19 (a).

The optimized values of the Heat transfer coefﬁcients calculated from the model are plotted in Figure 20 for both

E; the 1-g and u-g cases. The heat transfer coefﬁcients in space is much higher than on Earth as expected. The

"18","V. Conclusions

1 Four CVB heat pipe ﬁn heat exchangers were successfully tested on Earth and on the 188. Two sets of
data were obtained - the data from the dry module which were used for calibration and the data from the
wet module which were used to study the effect of the liquid.

2 The pressure of the vapor phase was used to calculate the vapor temperature and thus identify the
evaporator and condenser regions of a heat pipe. The temperature proﬁle observed in the space
environment varied greatly from the earth’s gravity proﬁle. There was a ﬂat isothermal region which is
absent on Earth.

3 The 10X Mapping from the three wet modules provided an insight into the ﬂuid ﬂow ﬁeld inside the
modules.

3 4 Isothermal data agreed very well with existing theoretical predictions of the Young-Laplace equation.
2. 5 Non-isothermal data also agreed well with our present understanding of the wickless heat pipe. Zones
g were identiﬁed and it was possible to locate the different regions like evaporator and condenser regions of
g the heat pipe.
E» 6 A model was developed to predict the radius of curvature as a function of axial distance, temperature in
3 the solid, and liquid and vapor pressure and velocity proﬁles. The radius of curvature of the liquid agreed
(2 well with the measurements.
