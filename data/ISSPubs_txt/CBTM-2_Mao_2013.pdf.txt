after landing. Panel A: AEM ground—control mice; panel B: spaceﬂight mice. TUNEL—positive cells were identified with green ﬂuorescence, the
nuclei of photoreceptors were counterstained with DAPI (blue). In the AEM ground—control retina, only sparse TUNEL—positive cells were found.
In the space—ﬂown retina, TUNEL—positive labeling was apparent in the inner nuclear layer and ganglion cell layer. Outer nuclear layer (ONL);
inner nuclear layer (INL); ganglion cell layer (GCL). Scale bar indicates 20 um.
