REGULATION OF PLANT GRAVITY SENSING AND SIGNALING
BY THE ACTIN CYTOSKELETONI
ELISON B. BLANCAFLOR2

Gravitropism is a process by which plant organs readjust their growth toward or away from the gravity vector when the plant is
reoriented. The actin cytoskeleton has often been a signiﬁcant component of models explaining gravitropism, but its role in this
process has become somewhat controversial in light of reports showing that actin inhibitors enhance the gravitropic response. The
work with inhibitors implies that actin might function as a negative regulator of gravitropism. In this article, possibilities for how
such a role might be accomplished are presented. First, the organization of actin in statocytes is revisited in an attempt to rational—
ize how compressive forces exerted by statoliths 0n membranes can lead to enhanced gravity sensing. Second, recent genetic work
in the model plant Arabidopsis thaliana is discussed, focusing on the potential involvement of the protein degradation machinery
in actin—mediated control of statolith dynamics and on the intriguing possibility that an actin—regulated, ligand—receptor mecha—
nism for gravity signal transduction might operate in higher plants. Third, modiﬁcations in the trafﬁcking of auxin efﬂuX transport—
ers are considered as possible mechanisms for the enhanced gravity responses observed in plant organs when the actin cytoskeleton
is disrupted by chemical inhibitors. The various possibilities presented in this reView emphasize the large amount of research that
remains to be done before we can fully understand how the actin cytoskeleton modulates tropisms in higher plants.
