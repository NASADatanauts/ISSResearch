Abstract
Flavonoids have attracted considerable attention in relation to their effects upon health. 8—Prenylnaringenin (8—PN) is found
in the common hop (Humulus lupulus) and assumed to be responsible for the health impact of beer consumption. We
wanted to clarify the effects of prenylation on the physiological functions of dietary flavonoids by comparing the effects of
8—PN with that of intact naringenin in the prevention of disuse muscle atrophy using a model of denervation in mice.
Consumption of 8-PN (but not naringenin) prevented loss of weight in the gastrocnemius muscle further supported by the
lack of induction of the protein content of a key ubiquitin ligase involved in muscle atrophy, atrogin-1, and by the activation
of Akt phosphorylation. 8-PN content in the gastrocnemius muscle was tenfold higher than that of naringenin. These results
suggested that, compared with naringenin, 8-PN was effectively concentrated into skeletal muscle to exert its preventive
effects upon disuse muscle atrophy. It is likely that prenylation generates novel functions for 8—PN by enhancing its
accumulation into muscle tissue through dietary intake.
