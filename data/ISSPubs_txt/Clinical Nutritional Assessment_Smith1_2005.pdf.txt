ABSTRACT Defining optimal nutrient requirements is critical for ensuring crew health during Iong-duration space
exploration missions. Data pertaining to such nutrient requirements are extremely limited. The primary goal of this
study was to better understand nutritional changes that occur during Iong-duration space flight. We examined
body composition, bone metabolism, hematology, general blood chemistry, and blood levels of selected vitamins
and minerals in 11 astronauts before and after Iong-duration (128—195 d) space flight aboard the International
Space Station. Dietary intake and limited biochemical measures were assessed during flight. Crew members
consumed a mean of 80% of their recommended energy intake, and on landing day their body weight was less (P
= 0.051) than before flight. Hematocrit, serum iron, ferritin saturation, and transferrin were decreased and serum
ferritin was increased after flight (P < 0.05). The finding that other acute-phase proteins were unchanged after flight
suggests that the changes in iron metabolism are not likely to be solely a result of an inflammatory response.
Urinary 8—hydroxy-2’-deoxyguanosine concentration was greater and BBC superoxide dismutase was less after
flight (P < 0.05), indicating increased oxidative damage. Despite vitamin D supplement use during flight, serum
25-hydroxycholecalciferol was decreased after flight (P < 0.01). Bone resorption was increased after flight, as
indicated by several markers. Bone formation, assessed by several markers, did not consistently rise 1 d after
landing. These data provide evidence that bone loss, compromised vitamin D status, and oxidative damage are
among critical nutritional concerns for Iong-duration space travelers. J. Nutr. 135: 437—443, 2005.
