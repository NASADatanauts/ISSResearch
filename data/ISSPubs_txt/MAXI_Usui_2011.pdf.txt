Abstract. We report the discovery of a dip structure in the pulse proﬁle of Be/X—ray binary
LS V +44 17 observed by RXTE during an outburst detected by MAXI. The outburst was
ﬁrst transient activity of LS V +44 17 since 1997 when the source was identiﬁed as a Be/X—ray
binary. After the discovery with MAXI, the RXTE observations provided a pulse proﬁle with a
narrow dip structure in the soft X—ray band (3—10 keV). Our pulse—phase—resolved spectroscopy
showed that the absorption column density at the dip phase is much higher than those at the
other intervals. Thus we can conclude that the partial eclipse of the emission region by the
accretion column of the neutron star causes the dip structure in the pulse proﬁle of LS V +44
17 during the ﬁrst outburst.
1. Introduction
The aooreting pulsar LS V +44 17/ RX J0440.9+4431 is one of Be/X—ray binaries consisting of
a neutron star (a pulsar) and a Be companion star. Be/X—ray binaries typically show periodic
and / or non—periodio outbursts which are thought due to a mass accretion from the companion
star to the neutron star through the oiroumsteller disk of the Be star. LS V +44 17 was discovered
during the ROSAT all—sky survey [1]. Reig and Roche [2] performed the RXTE observation and
obtained the sinusoidal pulse proﬁle with 202.5 i 0.5 see period. They Classiﬁed LS V +44 17
into one of persistent Be/X—ray binaries which show no outburst and stay in low luminosity
(g 1034—35ergs s_l).

Monitor of All—sky X—ray Image (MAXI) [3] is a highly sensitive all—sky monitor mounted on
the Exposed Facility of the J apanese Experimental Module ”Kibo” of the International Space
Station. MAXI has two X—ray cameras, GSC (Gas Slit Camera) and SSC (Solid—state Slit
Camera) and is monitoring the ﬂux of more than two hundred sources. Fig. 1 shows the2—20
keV light curve of LS V +44 17 obtained with GSC from 2009 August 15 to 2010 December
30. On 2010 March 31, MAXI detected an outburst of LS V +44 17 and reported it as the ﬁrst
transient activity for the source [4]. The X—ray ﬂux has increased for a week and ﬁnally reached
N150 mCrab in the 2—20 keV band.

Following the detection with MAXI, RXTE conﬁrmed the outburst on 2010 April 6 (see [5])
and carried out further observations on April 12 and 15 (the epochs of these observations, ObsA,
B and C, are shown in the small panel of Figure 1). We analyzed the RXTE data in the 2—60

2. Analysis and Results
2.]. Timing Analysis
We estimated pulse periods from the RXTE/PCA light curves after applying the barycentrie
correction. Performing the epoch folding search, we obtained N 205 sec pulse periods of LS
V +44 17 during the outburst. Considering a statistical error (almost several seconds) and a
long—term spin period Change, the estimated period is consistent with the past RXTE result.
Folding the light curve with this period, we obtained energy—resolved pulse proﬁle of the PCA
observation as shown in Figure 2. Phase 0.0 was Chosen at the minimum in the 3—20 keV PCA
pulse proﬁle for each observation. Notable point is that a narrow dip structure can be seen
at phase 0.7 in Figure 2. The dip appeared only in the soft energy bands (3—6 and 6—10
keV), but not in the hard band (10—20 keV). Similar structure was reported for two Be/X—ray
binaries (A0535+262 and RX J0812.4—3114) and can originate from a local absorption with
higher density matter, such as an accretion stream on the neutron star.

2.2. Pulse-phase-avemge Spectroscopy
We carried out pulse—phase—averaged spectroscopy for the three RXTE Observations. We used
a power—law model with an exponential cut—Off plus a blackbody and a Gaussian function
corresponding to an Fe emission line (the width of this component is ﬁxed to be 0.1 keV).
The best ﬁtting values are shown in Table 1, where the errors correspond to 1sigma.

2.3. Pulse-phase-resolved Spectroscopy
To investigate a phase dependence of the absorption column density we performed pulse—phase—
resolved spectral analysis for ObsA. We used the same spectral model of the phase—average
spectrum, where the photon index, the eut—oﬁ energy, the blackbody temperature and the peak
energy of an iron line were ﬁxed to the values obtained with the pulse—phase—averaged analysis.
The ratio between the power—law and blackbody normalization was also ﬁxed the phase—averaged
value. Figure 2 shows the phase dependence of the absorption column density and the highest
absorption density at the dip phase (phase N 0.7) is Clearly seen. Further, we present a ratio
between the phase—average and dip—phase spectra as Figure 3.

3. Discussion
According to Figure 2, the pulse proﬁle obtained during ObsA had the dip structure. Similar
sharp dips have been seen in the pulse proﬁles of the some Be/X—ray binaries (e.g. A 0535+262
and RX J0812.4—3114). The origin of the dip has been considered as an accretion ﬂow eclipses
[6] [7]. In this picture the X—ray emission originating from the surface of the neutron star is
reprocessed by the accretion ﬂow when it passes through the line of sight as the stars revolve
around each other. Cemeljié and Bulik [6] modeled the emission from a neutron star considering
the accretion ﬂow eclipse and reconstructed the pulse proﬁles of A0535+262 Galloway et a1.
[7] showed through pulse—phase—resolved spectroscopy that had the absorption column density
took maxima at dip phases of GX 1+4 and RX J0812.4—3114 . They argued that the results
conﬁrmed the dip origin which was the partial eclipse by the accretion column. Our result

shows that the accretion column density is the highest at the dip phase and affects the dip—
phase spectrum (Figure 2, 3). This result may be consistent With the model proposed for the
three binary systems, indicating that the accretion column eclipse affects the pulse proﬁle of LS
V +44 17 and generates the dip structure. In ﬁgure 3, the residuals remaining below 5 keV
can propose another low—temperature component. This component may be emitted from the
accretion disk or the accretion column. We Will report the analysis for the dip—phase spectrum
in our PASJ paper soon.
