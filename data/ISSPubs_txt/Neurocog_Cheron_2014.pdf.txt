Abstract
Visual perception is not only based on incoming visual signals but also on information about a multimodal reference frame
that incorporates vestibulo-proprioceptive input and motor signals. In addition, top-down modulation of visual processing
has previously been demonstrated during cognitive operations including selective attention and working memory tasks. In
the absence of a stable gravitational reference, the updating of sa|ient stimuli becomes crucial for successful visuo-spatial
behavior by humans in weightlessness. Here we found that visuaIIy-evoked potentials triggered by the image of a tunnel
just prior to an impending 3D movement in a virtual navigation task were altered in weightlessness aboard the International
Space Station, while those evoked by a classical 2D-checkerboard were not. Specifically, the analysis of event-related
spectral perturbations and inter-trial phase coherency of these EEG signals recorded in the frontal and occipital areas
showed that phase-Iocking of theta-alpha oscillations was suppressed in weightlessness, but only for the 3D tunnel image.
Moreover, analysis of the phase of the coherency demonstrated the existence on Earth of a directional flux in the EEG
signals from the frontal to the occipital areas mediating a top-down modulation during the presentation of the image of the
3D tunnel. |n weightlessness, this fronto-occipital, top-down control was transformed into a diverging flux from the central
areas toward the frontal and occipital areas. These results demonstrate that gravity—related sensory inputs modulate primary
visual areas depending on the affordances of the visual scene.
