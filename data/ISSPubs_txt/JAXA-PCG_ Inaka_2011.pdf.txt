determined at 2.0 A resolution. To obtain high—quality crystals, we tried, -
unsuccessfully, to crystallize the C65A mutant in microgravity under the
same conditions used in the previous study. After further purifying the 1574* ' 7
protein and changing the precipitant to polyethylene glycol (PEG) 8000, __ ,; 3
high—quality crystals were grown in microgravity. The precipitant solution
was 40% (w/V) PEG 8000, 100 mM sodium chloride, and 100 mM HEPES—NaOH (pH 7.0). Crystals grew on board the International
Space Station for 11 weeks in 2007, yielding single crystals of the wild—type L—PGDS and the C65A mutant, both of which diffracted at
around 1.0 A resolution. The crystal quality was markedly improved through the use of a high—Viscosity precipitant solution in microgravity,
in combination with the use of a highly puriﬁed protein.

wild-type L-PGDS showed the same PGDS activity as that of the

C89,189A mutant.14 They were concentrated to 40 mg mL_1 in

100 mM HEPES-NaOH, pH 7.0, and 100 mM sodium chloride using

a Centricon YM-10 membrane (10,000 nominal molecular weight limit;

was determined spectrophotometrically at 280 nm.

2.2. Crystallization. Wild-type mouse L-PGDS and its C6SA
mutant were crystallized inside the Russian TBU incubator on board

- the Russian Service Module on the International Space Station (188) for
a 11 weeks from August to October, 2007, as a microgravity experiment
supported by the Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency (JAXA).

The temperature was kept at 293 :I: 1 K in the TBU for ten weeks, but

. .. .4- it rose to 298 :I: 1 K for 90 min in the Soyuz Spacecraft on the return
ﬂight. The highest temperature was 299 K. Although the temperature
became high enough to damage some protein samples, the protein in this
report was suﬂiciently stable even at 299 K.

A gel-tube method,15 modiﬁed from the original counterdiffusion
method,16_18 was used for crystallization, as described.19 Brieﬂy, the
protein solution (8 ,uL, 40 mg mL_1 protein, 100 mM sodium chloride,

collected a diffraction data set up to 1.30 A (the maximum

grown in microgravity was reduced to 0.16 when compared to
the mosaicity 0f the crystals grown on the ground (0.35). Crystals

There are four variables in this report: the crystallization
method (counterdiffusion vs vapor—diffusion); the protein sam—
ple homogeneiety (high vs comparatively low); the precipitant
(PEG 8000 vs sodium malonate); and the crystallization enVir—
onment (space vs ground). All of these may contribute to the
improvement of crystal quality. In this study, we elucidated that
the variables positively work to obtain high quality crystals.

In the previously reported method, 2 M sodium malonate was
used as a precipitant with a less homogeneous protein sample of
mouse L—PGDS C65A mutant using the vapor—diffusion method
on the ground. However, the crystallization probability was low,
