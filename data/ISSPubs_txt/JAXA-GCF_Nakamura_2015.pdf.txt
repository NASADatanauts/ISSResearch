Hydrolysis of carbohydrates is a major bioreaction in nature, catalyzed by glycoside hydrolases (GHs). We used

neutron diffraction and high-resolution x-ray diffraction analyses to investigate the hydrogen bond network in

inverting cellulase PcCel45A, which is an endoglucanase belonging to subfamily C of GH family 45, isolated from

the basidiomycete Phanerochaete chrysosporium. Examination of the enzyme and enzyme—ligand structures indi-

cates a key role of multiple tautomerizations of asparagine residues and peptide bonds, which are finally connected

to the other catalytic residue via typical side—chain hydrogen bonds, in forming the ”Newton’s cradle”—like proton

relay pathway of the catalytic cycle. Amide—imidic acid tautomerization of asparagine has not been taken into ac-

count in recent molecular dynamics simulations of not only cellulases but also general enzyme catalysis, and it may

be necessary to reconsider our interpretation of many enzymatic reactions.
