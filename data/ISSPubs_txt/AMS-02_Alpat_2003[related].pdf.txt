Alpha Magnetic Spectrometer (AMSOZ) experiment on
the International Space Station (188)

Abstract The Alpha Magnetic Spectrometer experiment is realized in two phases. A precursor ﬂight (STS-9l)
with a reduced experimental conﬁguration (AMSOl) has successfully ﬂown on space shuttle Discovery in June 1998.
The ﬁnal version (AMSO2) will be installed on the International Space Station (188) as an independent module in
early 2006 for an operational period of three years. The main scientiﬁc objectives of AMSO2 include the searches for
the antiinatter and dark matter in cosmic rays. In this work we will discuss the experimental details as well as the im-
proved physics capabilities of AMSO2 on 188.
