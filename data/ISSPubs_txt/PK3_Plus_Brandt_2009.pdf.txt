Ensembles of particles with a spherically symmetric repulsive Yukawa interaction and additional
dipole—dipole interaction induced by an external ﬁeld eXhibit numerous solid—solid phase transitions
controlled by the magnitude of the ﬁeld. Such interactions emerge most notably in electro— and
magnetorheological ﬂuids and plasmas. We propose a simple variational approach based on the
Bogoliubov inequality for determining equilibrium solid phases. Phase diagrams for several regimes
are calculated and compared with previously performed Monte Carlo and molecular dynamics
simulations. © 2009 American Institute of Physics. [DOI: 10.1063/ 1.3143682]
