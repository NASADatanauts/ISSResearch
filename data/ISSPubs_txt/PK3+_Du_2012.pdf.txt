Abstract. A series of experiments dedicated to probing the phenomenon of
lane formation in binary complex plasmas over a broad range of parameters
has been performed with the PK-3 Plus laboratory on board the International
Space Station (188) under microgravity conditions. In the experiments, bunches
of small particles were driven through a background of big particles. We show
that the dynamics of lane formation varies considerably with the density of the
background and the size ratio between small and big particles. For consecutive
injections of small particles a memory effect of the previous penetration was
discovered for the ﬁrst time. This memory effect was investigated quantitatively
with respect to the structure formation and the penetration speed. We show
that the memory effect in lane formation is linear. In addition, we studied the
crossover from lane formation to phase separation driven by the nonadditive
interactions between small and big particles. We found that during this transition
the small penetrating particles effectively cage the background particles.

1. Introduction

Pattern formation in complex ﬂuids has been a long-standing, intriguing topic, e.g. electric-
ﬁeld-induced pattern formation in colloidal dispersions [1], and ‘Oscillons’ self—organized into
clusters in granular materials [2]. The dissipative interactions through friction are a source
of nonlinear dynamics and complexity which result in pattern formation on large scales. A
complex plasma showing non-Newtonian behavior [3] and Visco-elasticity [4] as a complex
ﬂuid is also the host of various pattern formation phenomena, e.g. plasma crystals [5—7], coaxial
ring patterns in strong magnetic ﬁelds [8] and lane formation [9]. Lane formation is an evolving
pattern formation that occurs when two species of particles are driven into each other. Like-
driven particles form lanes and move collectively. Typically, the lanes exhibit considerable
anisotropic structural order accompanied by an enhancement of mobility. Lane formation was
discovered in complex plasmas in 2009 [9] and has been studied both experimentally [10] and
numerically [11].

A complex plasma is comprised of ions, electrons, neutral gas and immersed particles,
whose diameters range from the nanometer scale to several hundreds of micrometers [12, 13].
These particles are charged either positively or negatively depending on the dominant charging
mechanism [14, 15]. For low-temperature laboratory gas discharges, particles of micrometer
size (microparticles) acquire negative charge due to the higher mobility of electrons, where the
net charge is roughly proportional to their size. The resulting surface potential is screened by
ions and electrons inside the plasma, which leads to repulsive Yukawa-type interactions. Under
microgravity conditions the microparticles are trapped in the plasma potential well, and tend to
form a homogeneous three-dimensional (3D) cloud usually with a VOid in the center [16]. Within
the cloud, particles experience not only Yukawa-type interaction but also an electric force due
to the plasma potential well, friction due to the neutral gas and an ion drag force due to the ion
ﬂow.

In this paper, we review a series of experiments on the lane formation Observed in complex
plasmas under microgravity conditions. The experiments presented here were performed in the
PK-3 Plus laboratory [17] on board the International Space Station (188). The paper covers all
lane formation experiment data from July 2006 until January 2011. This paper is organized
as follows. In section 2, we introduce the setup of the PK-3 Plus laboratory, describe the
experiment procedure and mention their limits. In section 3, the analysis method for quantifying

the lane structure is described in detail. In sections 4—7, we investigate different aspects of lane
formation. Finally, the conclusions are presented in section 8.
2. The experimental setup and procedures
PK-3 Plus is the second-generation microgravity laboratory that was specially designed for
complex plasma research on board the 188 [17]. Different types of experiments have been
performed including externally excited wave propagation [18], heartbeat oscillation [19],
plasma crystal formation [20], etc. The setup consists of a capacitively coupled radio-frequency
(rf) chamber and surrounding infrastructure including laser illumination, a gas system, a Video
recording system, a vacuum system, as well as a control system. The chamber itself has a cubic
shape and contains two circular electrodes that are 3 cm from each other, as shown in ﬁgure 1(b).
Each electrode has a diameter of 6 cm and is surrounded by a grounded guard ring of 1.5 cm
width. Each guard ring includes three dispensers, which allow the injection of monodisperse
microparticles of siX different sizes: silica microparticles with a diameter of 1.55 :I: 0.04 um
and melamine-formaldehyde (MF) microparticles with diameters of 2.55 :I: 0.04, 3.43 :I: 0.06,
6.81 :|:0.1, 9.19:|:0.09 and 14.9:|:0.26 ,LLIII. The particles can be injected by shaking the
dispenser controlled by a coil. The inj ected particle number can be tuned by varying the shaking
time. The glass walls are made of quartz through which the dynamics of individual particles and
the structure of the microparticle cloud can be recorded by three CCD cameras: the ‘overView
(0V) camera’ includes the whole area inside the chamber, the ‘high resolution (HR) camera’
focuses on the center of the chamber and a ‘glow camera’ (not shown in the ﬁgure) records
the plasma discharge with a similar ﬁeld of View as the 0V camera. In our experiments on
lane formation, the Videos are all recorded by the ‘quadrant View (QV) camera’, which records
only half of the ﬁeld of View captured by the 0V camera with a higher spatial resolution.
The maximal recording speed for all four cameras is 50 fps (frames per second). As shown
in ﬁgure 1, the particles are illuminated by a laser sheet with a full-width at half-maXimum
(FWHM) of about 80 um at the focal aXis perpendicular to the cameras’ line of sight. The
cameras and lasers are mounted on a translation stage which can move back and forth with a
given speed. This function makes it possible to scan the particle cloud in the chamber and obtain
3D information. However, due to the limited scan speed, it is not possible to Visualize the 3D
information in some experiments with fast dynamics, such as lane formation.

The experiment procedure is relatively simple. After igniting the argon plasma, we inserted
a relatively large number of particles of one type to ﬁll the chamber and waited for a while to
let the particles form a homogeneous background cloud. Then we injected particles of another
species which are smaller than the eXisting particles in the chamber. We distinguish between
the two particle species based on their kinetics. The small particles penetrate into the cloud of
big particles due to the driving force Fd resulting from the electric force (plasma potential), ion
drag force and neutral friction. Whether the lane structure can be formed during the penetration
depends on several factors including the number density ratio, the size ratio between big and
small particles and plasma parameters such as plasma potential. While the small particles pen-
etrate the background cloud, the nonadditiVity between small and big particles (an asymmetry
in the mutual interactions between particles of different species [21]) leads to phase separation.
The small particles start to form a dense droplet that ﬁnally settles around the central void.

The plasma conditions cannot be controlled directly. They depend on several control
parameters such as the neutral gas type, neutral gas pressure, discharge power and the number of

microparticles injected into the discharge. In all the cases studied, lane structures of background
particles are formed, unless the input power is too low to sustain a stable particle cloud [19].
The experiments described in this paper are performed in argon gas at a pressure of
30 Pa and at a peak—tO-peak rf voltage of 40V. This results in an effective current [eff = 6 mA
measured on the electrodes. Some experimental measurements of the plasma parameters in the
PK-3 Plus chamber in ground-based conditions have recently been reported [22]. In order to get
the order of magnitude estimate for the present experimental conditions, we use the results of
SIGLO-2D plasma simulation published earlier [17]. For the above-mentioned conditions, the
plasma density at the center of the discharge chamber (in the absence of particles) is estimated
as ne 2 mi 2 n0 2 8 X 108 cm‘3 and the electron temperature is T e 2 4 eV. The ion temperature
is expected to be equal to the neutral gas temperature Ti 2 T n 2 0.025 eV. This results in the
ion (electron) Debye radius of X131 2 40 ,um (ADe 2 500 ,um) and the ion mean free path of
li = 70 ,um. The particle Charges are then estimated taking into account the collisional [23] and
ionization-enhanced [24] ion collection by the particle. The resulting charges are summarized
in table 1. We point out that the presence of particles in the discharge can modify plasma
parameters. In particular, the ion density in the particle cloud should exceed the electron density
to keep quasi-neutrality. This, in turn, lowers the particle Charges in comparison with the
individual particle regime. We expect, however, that these effects are not dominant under the
conditions investigated, since the value of the Havnes parameter P = (a Te/ez)(np/n0) remains
below unity in all the experiments discussed in this paper [25] (here a is the particle radius and
np is the particle number density).

The particle number density ratio can be tuned relatively precisely and the size ratio
between big and small particles is deﬁned within a few per cent. Due to the mounting location
Of dispensers 0n the chamber and the camera position, only dispensers 2 and 3 (cf see ﬁgure 1),
which contain MF particles with diameters of 2.55 :I: 0.04 and 3.43 :I: 0.06 ,LLIII, can be used for
the penetration experiments. Particles inj ected from dispenser 3 enter the ﬁeld of View from the
left and their motion towards the center can be fully resolved: we call this ‘in-plane injection’.
In contrast, particles injected from dispenser 2 move in the line of sight of the camera. Thus,
they move perpendicular to the ﬁeld of View, which allows us to record a full cross section
through the penetration region, but not the motion of individual small particles: this is denoted as
‘in-the-line-of—sight injection’. Dispenser 1 injects 1.55 ,th particles from the right—hand side.
This ﬁeld of View is Visible only with the 0V camera, the resolution of which is too low to
identify the particle positions and motion.

3. The analysis method

In this paper, we focus on the lane structure formed by big particles in the background during

the penetration. In order to quantify such structures, we employ the anisotropic scaling indeX

method (ASIM) to realize a local nonlinear measure for structure characterization [26]. The

ASIM has been applied to various studies, for instance complex plasma [27], cosmology [26]

and medical image processing [28]. This method detects the ‘local lane structure’ of each

particle by assessing the local scaling properties of particle density in the neighborhood.

The size of the neighborhood and the degree of anisotropy are controlled by two additional

characteristic parameters: the length R and aspect the ratio 6 of ‘ideal’ lanes.

For a given set of particle positions, [r j], j = l, . . . , N , the anisotropic scaling index at is
deﬁned as

2 N d- R 2 e‘wﬂc/R)2
a(rj,R,€,6)=X:k_1(NJk/—_;W, (1)
Zk=1 e J

where djk = d(rj, rk, e, 6) is the distance between particles j and k in a space stretched by 6

along the direction u = ($31399 ), —7T / 2 g 6’ g 77 / 2. In practice, we transform the coordinates of

particle positions in the new space by applying a stretch matrix A = ((1) 2) and rotation matrix

S2 = ($10599 3:339) on the experiment coordinates, i.e. 1""]. 2 ASer, and thus, djk = lr’j — FZI- By

determining the value of 6’ that maximizes the difference 05(1‘ j, R, e, 6’ + 77 / 2) — 05(1‘ j, R, e, 6),

we Obtain a ‘preferred’ direction u j associated with particle j , signifying the local anisotropy.

The ‘length’ of this anisotropy is given by R and 6 describes the ratio between its ‘length’ and

‘width’.

In order to characterize the global laning of big particles in each single frame, we
deﬁne a laning-order parameter Sb, which is the largest eigenvalue of a second-rank tensor
T = 2N ‘1 23:1 u j (8) u j — I , where I is an identity matrix. Sb 2 1 denotes perfect alignment

(of the preferred angles), while Sb 2 0 represents a perfectly random phase. Because of the
similar morphology of the lane structure in the experiments presented in this paper, we use the
same spatial scale R = 1200 um and the anisotropic aspect ratio 6 = 5 throughout this analysis.
The value of R corresponds to the typical length of lanes in our experiments and the value of 6
represents the typical length to width ratio.

4. Dependence of lane formation on the number density ratio

The number density ratio between the background and the penetrating particles is one of the
most important factors inﬂuencing lane formation in our experiments. We study three cases
with low, medium and high density clouds of small particles (MF particles with a diameter
of 3.4 ,LLm) injected into the same background cloud of large particles, one after another. The
background particle cloud (MF particles with a diameter of 6.8 ,LLm) is prepared prior to the
start of injections and is not replaced between injections. As some volume around the central
void is occupied by small particles, the initial number density of the background is increased
slightly after each injection. In order to inject small particle clouds with different densities, we
set the shaking time (ts) of the particle dispenser to three different values: (I) low rs = 31 ms, (II)
medium rs = 33 ms and (III) high rs = 35 ms. Generally speaking, the longer the shaking time,
the more particles are injected. As this increases the number of particles injected as one bunch,
this effectively results in denser small particle clouds (see also the next paragraph).

To estimate the number density ratio nS / nb, where nS/b is the number density of small/big
particles, we select a ﬁxed square area in the center of the penetration region, as shown in
ﬁgure 3, where we count the number of small (big) particles NS (Nb): nS/nb = NS/Nb. When
the small particles pass through the penetration region, NS increases, while big particles are
expelled and Nb decreases. Please note that the variation of Nb with time is the same during
penetration for all three injections. The change of HS / nb results from the change of NS, i.e. from
the increased density of the small particle cloud. The number density ratio nS/nb for all three
cases is shown in ﬁgure 2.

We quantify the lane structure formed by big particles during penetration by ASIM
described in the previous section. For the purpose of eliminating boundary effects and to deﬁne
the penetration region, we select an ROI (see ﬁgure 3). The same ROI is used for all three
injection eases. Figure 3 summarizes the results for the three injection cases. For every case
it shows two diagrams. In the left column the morphology for in-plane injection is Visualized:
all positions of small (in red) as well as big (in cyan) particles from 250 frames (2 5 s) are
superimposed into a single picture. When the small particles are injected from the dispenser
mounted on the top ﬂange, the direction of penetration of the small particle cloud is slanted.
Apparently, small particles in the upper half of the picture are denser than in the lower half.
In this picture a small central square indicates where nS/nb was estimated, and the ROI for the
calculation of Sb is emphasized. In the right column the temporal evolution of Sb as well as of
the particle number in the ROI are shown.

The number of particles in the ROI develops similarly for all three cases. As small particles
enter the ROI, big particles are repelled out of the ROI by the small particles. This is possible
because the conﬁnement by the plasma potential is weak. As the number density of the small
particles is higher than the background cloud, the total number of particles in the ROI is
increased during the penetration. As we can see in ﬁgure 3, the maximum total number of
particles in the ROI occurs at the same time (t m 2 s) for all injection eases. Also the minimum of

Figure 2. Evolution of the particle number density ratio. The number of large
(Nb) and small (NS) particles is measured in a square close to the center of
the penetration region. The number density ratio is given by nS/nb = NS/Nb.
Three different curves are drawn for three different dispenser shaking times,
corresponding to three densities of the injected small particle cloud: (1) IS =
31 ms, low density as red circles, (11) IS = 33 ms, medium density as orange
crosses and (111) IS = 35 ms, high density as green triangles.
the number of big particles occurs at the same time (t m 2.5 s). This implies that the penetration
dynamics of small particles is comparable in all three cases.

In contrast, the laning order parameter Sb evolves differently in all three inj eetion cases. It is
clearly Visible that the lane structure of big particles is only formed in that part Of the penetration
region where the density of the small particle cloud is high enough, and for the high-density case
(111) the order parameter even seems to attain some plateau during the penetration. For case (111)
due to the high density of small particles injected, once they penetrate into the big particles,
they effectively cage the big particles (as described in detail in section 7). Therefore, the lane
structure of hi g particles is formed instantaneously and maintained until the small particles leave
the ROI. In case (I) and also (11), the number density of small particles is not sufﬁcient to cage the
big particles everywhere, so that the big particles on the sides can escape across the wings of the
small particle cloud. Also note that with increasing density of the small particle cloud, Sb reaches
its maximum value earlier: for the low-density ease (I) ta) m 3 s, for the medium-density case
(11) tab m 2.5 s and for the high-density case (111) Ian) m 1.3 s. This is because at later times even
cases (I) and (II) attain sufﬁcient densities inside the R01 to cage the big particles from escaping.
Interestingly enough, ease (1) reaches the highest value 513(1) m 0.3, whereas Sbm) m 0.28 and
Shall) m 0.23. Even though fewer big particles get caged in case (I), the lanes formed by the
big particles have a narrower distribution of preferred angles, which directly leads to a higher
value of Sb. For case (11) and increasingly so for case (111), the penetration geometry allows for a
wider range of preferred angles, and therefore for a systematic decrease of the peak value of Sb.
Take note that these results are not conclusive, since the evolution of Sb strongly depends on the
initial conﬁguration. According to the numerical study presented in [l 1], Sb varies dramatically
for statistically independent but thermodynamically equivalent initial conﬁgurations. A huge
number of repetitions of the experiment (several hundreds of times according to the simulation)
is necessary to obtain a statistically signiﬁcant laning order parameter. This is not really

feasible in our experiments due to the limited resources (gas, particles, operator time) on board
the 18$.
5. Dependence of lane formation on the size ratio
In order to compare the inﬂuence of the particle size ratio, we use MF particles with a diameter
of 9.2 ,th as background particles and keep MF particles with a diameter of 3.4 ,th as the
penetrating particles. The same pressure, rf voltage and ROI as in section 4 are used. As we
see in ﬁgure 4, the number of big particles and the total number of particles in the R01 are
comparable with ease (I) of the previous section. However, the maximum of the total particle
number and the minimum of the number of big particles occur earlier than for ease (I). This
implies a higher penetration speed. Also a higher peak value of Sb is attained.

For a combination of particles with larger difference in size, in other words, larger
nonadditiVity [21], this seems eounter-intuitive. The simulation results in [11] show that with
higher nonadditiVity, particles penetrate slower and the peak value of the laning-order parameter
becomes smaller. However, in reality, the situation is more complicated. The change of the size
of background particles changes not only the nonadditiVity, but also the particle cloud proﬁle
as well as the local plasma parameters. The difference between the ion and the electron density
tends to be larger in the plasma with bigger particles because of electron depletion due to the
higher charge on the surface of big particles [25]. This results in a stronger electric ﬁeld and
therefore increases the driving force and penetration speed. Besides, the coupling strength for
the cloud of bigger particles is higher, resulting in a more ordered system. Small particles can

Figure 5. Memory effect on the laning-order parameter. The temporal evolution
of Sb is displayed for three sets of two consecutive injections with different
intervals At. Symbols with error bars in black, red, and green correspond to
the cases with AI = 3, 5, l2 s (see also movies 5, 6 and 7, available from
stacks.i0p.0rg/N J P/ 14/07305 8/mmedia), respectively. The locations of the peaks

penetrate more easily in such a system than in a disordered system. Since the nonadditiVity has
a minor inﬂuence on the lane formation compared to other factors such as particle interaction
or driving force, we can conclude from the experiment that a combination of particles with a
larger size difference leads to more pronounced lane formation.
6. Memory effect
As mentioned before, when the small particles penetrate the big particle cloud, they repel these
background particles outwards, creating sponge-like tunnels. After the small particles have
passed through the cloud of big particles, it takes some time for the big particles to relaX and
reﬁll the empty tunnels [29, 30]. If small particles are injected into the big particle cloud before
complete relaxation of the background, the remnant of the sponge-like structure will inﬂuence
the penetration of small particles and therefore the dynamics of lane formation. We call this the
‘memory effect’ of lane formation.

In this section, we investigate this phenomenon by injecting two consecutive bunches of
small particles with a variable time interval AI in between. We used At = 3 s, Ar = 5 s and
At = 12 s. The memory effect is evaluated in terms of the laning-order parameter of the big
particles Sb and the penetration speed of the small particles. The penetrating particles have a
diameter of 3.4 ,th and the background particles have a diameter of 9.2 ,LLIII.

Figure 5 shows the temporal evolution of Sb. Three messages can be read from the diagram,
namely the time separation of peaks by consecutive injections, the relaxation process of Sb and
the peak value of Sb. For all three cases the laning-order parameter has a ﬁrst maximum at
t m 1.5 s after the small particles appear in the camera View. The initial value of Sb, its rise time,
peak value and relaxation for the ﬁrst injection are basically identical in all three cases. The
second peak of the order parameter, however, appears at different times completely determined
by the selected injection interval. Of all three cases only for the largest injection time interval
At = 12 s is the relaxation time long enough for the laning-order parameter to reach its initial
value Sb m 0.08. That means that the lane structure among the big particles vanishes, and the

tunnels left by the small particles are ﬁlled. The background particles form a homogeneous
dust cloud, similar to before the initial injection. In this case, the consecutive penetration can
be treated independently of the initial penetration. For the other two cases where At = 3 s and
At = 5 s, the relaxation time is too short, so that the laning-order parameter cannot be restored
to the initial value. The lane structure in the background does not dissolve completely and the
tunnels remain to different extents depending on the relaxation time. For the shortest interval
At = 3 s, Sb falls to m 0.14, before it starts to increase again due to the consecutive injection.
For At = 5 s it reaches Sb m 0.10. Note that for all three cases the relaxation of the ﬁrst peak
is completely identical till I m 2.8 s and that the relaxation of the second peaks is consistent.
Also, the value of the second peak is independent of the relaxation process. Even though, for
the consecutive injection, Sb starts from m 0.14, m 0.10 or m 0.08, it reaches the same peak
value Sb m 0.22 in all three cases. That means that the memory effect in lane formation is a
linear phenomenon.

The memory effect can also be investigated from the point of View Of the kinetics of
the small particles. The tunnels left in the background particles during the initial penetration
inﬂuence the penetration speed of the small particles in the consecutive injection. We investigate
this effect by measuring the cumulative difference of mean Gauss-ﬁt penetration speed (x-
eomponent of velocity) of small particles between consecutive and initial inj eetion: Lg A2? (t) dt,
where A270) 2 E(I + At) — E(I), E(I) is the average speed of small particles in the x-direetion,
T is the penetration time (integral from to = 0.6 s in our case), and At E [3 s, 5 s, 12 s] is the
selected time interval. The results for all three cases are shown in ﬁgure 6. In the ease of
At 2 12s, the difference varies around zero during the whole penetration process, leading
to a cumulative difference slightly above zero. The small particle speed in the consecutive
penetration is marginally increased over the initial penetration. Due to the short penetration time
and lack of statistics it is not clear if this marginal increase derives from statistical ﬂuctuations or

small particles. The pictures show a superposition of particle positions of four
consecutive frames at three times during the penetration for the time interval
At = 3 s. The left picture (a) shows the initial injection, and the right picture
(b) the corresponding consecutive injection. Each picture is made up Of three
panels. Each panel shows a part Of the original picture at its original position.

from a change in the background structure. For the cases with short relaxation time At = 3 s, 5 s,
the penetration speed difference is mainly positive during the penetration. This can be clearly
seen as a positive slope of the cumulative difference, indicating a speedup of the consecutive
penetration process over the initial one. The dogleg bend of both curves at t = 1.6 s happens
when the particle bunch from the consecutive inj eetion hits the cloud of small particles from the
initial injection close to the center of the chamber. The speedup is mainly caused by the tunnels
formed during the ﬁrst penetration, which dramatically reduces the resistance the small particles
experience during the penetration. With the presence of these tunnels, the small particles will
mainly follow them, taking the same path as in the previous penetration, as can be seen in
ﬁgure 7. With the longer time interval At = 12 s, small particles take completely different paths
to penetrate the background particle cloud.
7. Crossover from lane formation to phase separation
As we described in the previous sections, each experiment goes through three main stages.
Initially, the small particles are injected into the plasma and move under the inﬂuence of the
inhomogeneous plasma potential. Then they enter the background Cloud of big particles where
lane formation can occur. Finally, when the small particles approach the center where the driving
force exerted on small particles, Fd, decreases due to the effective potential conﬁguration, phase
separation of small and big particles due to nonadditiVity starts to dominate and the small
particles form a droplet. Between all three stages there is a smooth transition. The transition
from the injection to the laning stage is signiﬁcantly inﬂuenced by the initial conﬁguration of
the contact, which has been extensively studied numerically in [11]. During the laning stage
the small and big particles form an array of interpenetrating lanes [9]. At the ﬁnal stage of the

experiments, the ratio of the magnitude of the driving force to the nonadditivity parameter,
R = Fd/A, describes the competition between lane formation and demiXing, similar to the
Weber number in a macroscopic ﬂuid system, which is used to determine the transition from
lane formation to the classical Rayleigh—Taylor instability [31]. As the ratio R decreases the
penetrating particles form a separated droplet (composed of small particles only) that moves
as an ensemble towards the center of the chamber. This phenomenon is generally known as
demiXing (phase separation) [11, 21, 32].

During the crossover from the laning stage to the phase separation stage there is a change
in the laning mode, from free lane formation to a demiXing dominated mode, where the interior
part of the small particle cloud already forms a honeycomb-like substructure, in which big
particles can be effectively caged, while big particles closer to the wings of the small particle
cloud are quickly expelled (see section 4 and ﬁgure 8). During this crossover, lanes are formed
by the big particles only. To ﬁnally form a dense cluster of small particles (see ﬁgure 9), the
lanes of hi g particles are expelled from the rear of the honeycomb structure. This is an important
process in the phase separation dynamics.

The cage effect and the crossover can be better Visualized in the in-the-line-of—sight
injection. Due to the limitations of the setup conﬁguration (camera position and dispenser
arrangement) as described in section 2, we are not able to perform experiments with the

and background big particles in cyan. Picture (a) is an extension of picture (a)
in ﬁgure 8. The in-the-line-Of-sight picture has been recorded with a shifted
z-position z = 14 mm of the laser and camera system (see also movie 10,

same particle combinations as for in-plane injection. Therefore, we used MF particles with a
diameter of 2.5 ,LLm as the penetrating particles and MF particles with a diameter of 14.9 ,LLm
as background particles. This makes it easier to distinguish particles of different types in the
recorded movies. Here, we do not intend to make quantitative comparison but only demonstrate
the cage effect qualitatively.

As we can see in ﬁgures 8(b) and (e), the small particles form a honeycomb structure,
penetrating the big particle cloud. These pictures show two cross sections through the system
24 and 19 mm away from the center of the chamber in the z-direetion. The equivalent positions
0fthese1ayers in an in-plane injection are indicated as gray bars in ﬁgure 8(a), which is adopted
and magniﬁed from ﬁgure 3(b). The honeycomb structure is Visible as a band structure in the
in-plane injection. Within the cells of such a honeycomb structure, big particles are caged and
form lanes. The big particles in the perimeter of the small particle cloud move outwards when
the small particles contact and penetrate the respective layers. This corresponds to the repulsion
of big particles from the ROI mentioned in the previous section. These particles move back to
their original positions after the small particles leave the layer, resulting in curly trajectories.

When we look at the cross section closer to the center of the chamber (z = 19 mm), the
small particle cloud becomes much denser, so that the cells of the honeycomb structure shrink
dramatically. The system starts the crossover from lane formation to phase separation.

The fully phase separated particle cloud in the vicinity of the void (z = 14 mm) is shown
in ﬁgure 9. The big particles are almost completely expelled out Of the small particle cluster so
that the honeycomb structure of small particles vanishes. At this moment, small particles and
big particles demiX completely and phase separation of the two particle species is achieved.
8. Conclusion
To conclude, we have presented a series of experiments on lane formation under microgravity
conditions on board the 188 with the PK-3 Plus setup. Big particles form pronounced lane
structures when small particles are driven and penetrate through them. A sensitive lane-order
parameter based on anisotropic sealing indiees enabled us to identify an Optimal number density
ratio between small and big particles for the lane formation. It is also found that big particles
are more easily caged between the lanes formed by small particles if the number of injected
small particles is increased. These caged big particles form streaming lanes and result in a peak
value in the lane-order parameter. As the small particles leave the big particle cloud, the leftover
cavities in the big particle cloud are reﬁlled with big particles due to relaxation. By tuning the
time interval between two consecutive penetration events of small particles, we investigated
the ‘memory’ effect of the previous penetration 0n the consecutive one. The shorter the time
interval, the greater the number of tunnels left from the initial penetration and the faster the
small particles penetrate through the background particle cloud. We found that the peak values
of the lane-order parameter from all cases with different time intervals are all about 0.22, which
indicates that the ordering of the laning pattern has no evident dependence on the time interval
and that the memory effect is linear. These leftover eaVities from the previous penetration event
serve as fast channels for the consecutive injection event and result in a clear speedup of the
penetration of small particles. In addition, a crossover from free lane formation to a demiXing
dominated mode of the nonequilibrium system has been Observed.
