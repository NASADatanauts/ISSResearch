gas (yellow and green). Ultramarine lines exist only in EUl and green lines exist only in EU2. The main components of the
ﬂuid loop are the test Channel (TC) With a free surface (FS), the pump (P), the phase separation Chamber (PSC), the ﬂow
preparation Chamber (FPC), and the compensation tube (CT). The TC shown here is only valid for EUl, because in EU2 only
one slider (81) is present.
