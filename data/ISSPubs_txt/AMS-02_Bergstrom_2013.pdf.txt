The Alpha Magnetic Spectrometer experiment onboard the International Space Station has recently
provided cosmic ray electron and positron data With unprecedented precision in the range from 0.5 to
350 GeV. The observed rise in the positron fraction at energies above 10 GeV remains unexplained, With
proposed solutions ranging from local pulsars to TeV—scale dark matter. Here, we make use of this high
quality data to place stringent limits on dark matter with masses below ~300 GeV, annihilating or
decaying to leptonic ﬁnal states, essentially independent of the origin of this rise. We signiﬁcantly improve
on existing constraints, in some cases by up to 2 orders of magnitude.
