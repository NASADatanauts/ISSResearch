Abstract
The International Caenorhabditis elegans Experiment First Flight (ICE-First) was a project using C. elegans as a model organism
to study the biological effects of short duration spaceﬂight (11 days in the International Space Station). As a member of the ICE-Ftrst
research team, our group focused on the mutational effects of spaceﬂight. Several approaches were taken to measure mutational
changes that occurred during the spaceﬂight including measurement of the integrity of poly-G/poly-C tracts. determination of the
mutation frequency in the unc-22 gene, analysis of lethal mutations captured by the genetic balancer eTl(III;V). and identiﬁcation
of alterations in telomere length. By comparing the efﬁciency, sensitivity, and convenience of these methods. we deduced that the
eTl balancer system is well—suited for capturing, maintaining and recovering mutational events that occur over several generations ,
during spaceﬂight. In the course of this experiment, we have extended the usefulness of the .97""! balancer system by identifying the
physical breakpoints of the eTI translocation and have developed a PCR assay to follow the :77 chromosomes. C. elegans animals
were grown in a deﬁned liquid media during the spaceﬂight. This is the ﬁrst analysis of genetic changes in C. elegans grown in the
deﬁned media. Although no signiﬁcant difference in mutation rate was detected between spaceﬂight and control samples, which
is not surpn'sing given the short duration of the spaceﬂight, we demonstrate here the utility of worms as an integrating biological
dosimeter for spaceﬂight.
