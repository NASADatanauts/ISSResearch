Setting a Standard: The LImu/us Amebocyte Lysate Assay
and the Assessment of MleOblal Contamination
on Spacecraft Surfaces
Heather C. Morris,1 Lisa A. Monaco,1 Andrew Steele,2 and Norm Wainwright3
Abstract
Historically, colony-forming units as determined by plate cultures have been the standard unit for microbio-
logical analysis Of environmental samples, medical diagnostics, and products for human use. However, the time
and materials required make plate cultures expensive and potentially hazardous in the closed environments of
future NASA missions aboard the International Space Station and missions to other Solar System targets. The
Limulus Amebocyte Lysate (LAL) assay is an established method for ensuring the sterility and cleanliness of
samples in the meat-packing and pharmaceutical industries. Each of these industries has verified numerical
requirements for the correct interpretation of results from this assay. The LAL assay is a rapid, point-of-use,
verified assay that has already been approved by NASA Planetary Protection as an alternate, molecular method
for the examination of outbound spacecraft. We hypothesize that standards for molecular techniques, similar to
those used by the pharmaceutical and meat-packing industries, need to be set by space agencies to ensure
accurate data interpretation and subsequent decision making. In support of this idea, we present research that
has been conducted to relate the LAL assay to plate cultures, and we recommend values obtained from these
investigations that could assist in interpretation and analysis of data obtained from the LAL assay. Key Words:
