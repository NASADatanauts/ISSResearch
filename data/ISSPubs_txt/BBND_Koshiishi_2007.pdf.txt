Abstract
The Bonner Ball Neutron Detector (BBND) experiment was conducted onboard the US Laboratory Module 0f the International Space Station
(188) as part Of the Human Research Facility project of NASA in order to evaluate the neutron radiation environment in the energy range
from thermal up to 15 MeV inside the 188. The BBND experiment was carried out over an eight—month period from 23 March through 14
November 2001, corresponding to the maximum period Of solar—actiVity variation. The neutron differential—energy spectra are compared with
the model neutron spectrum predicted for the inside of the ISS, and are found to be in good agreement for E > 10 keV. In contrast, the 188
model spectrum has lower ﬂuX for E < 10 keV, which is likely due to the difference in the shielding environment. The neutron dose equivalent
rates are 69 and 88 ttSV/day for the two locations inside the US Laboratory Module, representing a 30% increase due to the difference in the
localized shielding environment inside the same pressurized module. The inﬂuence of the ISS altitude variation is estimated for the neutron
dose equivalent rate to increase by a factor of 2 over the ISS altitude variation of 300—500 km. The increase in the cumulative neutron dose
equivalent due to the most signiﬁcant solar event during the BBND experiment is 0.15 mSV, which contributes less than 1% t0 the annual
neutron dose equivalent estimated from the BBND experiment.
