Abstract. We have performed phase ﬁeld simulations in order to explore the effect of equiaxed

grain nucleation undercooling 0n the columnar t0 equiaxed transition ”CET” in the NPG—DC

alloy system. Our phase ﬁeld model is based on the multiphase—ﬁeld method. The simulation

parameters are adapted to a microgravity experiment performed under purely diffusive growth

conditions. The experimental investigation is made during the sounding rocket campaign

TEXUS—47.
1. Introduction
Multiscale and multiphase modeling of solidiﬁcation is a subject of active research in materials
science. Understanding the effects of macroscopic process conditions on the microstructure
evolution is important to assure e.g. the mechanical properties of the casting. The columnar
t0 equiaxed transition (CET) in dendritic solidiﬁcation describes a discontinuous Change
in microstructure and is a common morphological transition in technical castings. The
microstructure is called columnar if the dendritic growth tends to one direction, Whereas equiaxed
grains are oriented in all directions. The CET depends on the thermal conditions deﬁned on
the macroscopic scale, the local undercooling near the solid—liquid interface, Which is determined
by the dendritic morphology 0n the microscale, the thermophysical properties of the alloy and
the nucleation mechanism of equiaxed dendrites. The NeopentylglyCOl—DCamphor (NPG—DC)
alloy is a transparent organic alloy Which allows an in—situ observation of the solidiﬁcation
microstructure at temperatures Closed to ambient. This alloy is used as analogue system With
metallic alloys, Which are opaque, and only enable a post—mortem analysis of the structure. We
have performed simulations on the GET in the NPG—DC alloy system using a multi—phase ﬁeld
model [1, 2, 3] in 2D and 3D, in the limit of diffusive mass transport. Additional effects of
thermosolutal convection and buoyancy 0r sedimentation can be neglected under lOW—gravity
conditions.

2. Phase Field Model
In the present work, the multi—phase ﬁeld formulation proposed by Steinbaeh et al [1] and further
developed towards the coupling to thermodynamic databases [3] is employed to describe the
morphological evolution during the solid—liquid phase transformation. The phase ﬁeld method
relies on a phase ﬁeld parameter (gb) Which varies continuously from liquid ”1” ($20) to solid
”s” ($21) along the solid—liquid interface of Width 77. The evolution of the phase ﬁeld parameter
in time is given by :

Where M g(ﬁ) is the anisotropic interfacial mobility between liquid and solid as a function of the
interface orientation (described by the normal 75’) and a:l(ﬁ) is the effective anisotropic surface
energy. The anisotropic functions for the both parameters are written in expansion in terms
of normalized spherical harmonies y; selected under consideration of the speciﬁc crystal lattice

Where M 81 and (751 are the isotropic phase ﬁeld mobility and surface energy, respectively. The
thermodynamic driving force AG 8; depends on the respective bulk free energies f8(58) and fl(5}),
determined using a thermodynamic database, [5 is the generalized Chemical potential introduced
to conserve local concentration due to the constraint of quasi—equilibrium. This constraint
postulates that all the reduced Chemical potentials are the same for the coexisting phases i.e
FL = #745457?) = ﬁz(5z(f))-
The evolution of the concentration ﬁeld is given by:
5: V(gbsDSVE’S) + V(glelVE’l), (5)
Where D8 and D1 are the diffusion coefﬁcients in the solid and liquid phase, respectively. We
have converted the liquid concentration (01) into a constitutional undereooling in the melt (AT0)
using the relation ATC : Tl(cl) — T Where Tl(cl) is the liquidus temperature and T is the local
temperature deﬁned by :
TZTB—Cr'td-G'Z (6)
Where TB is the temperature at the bottom of the domain, 0,» is the cooling rate, G is the thermal
gradient.

3. Microgravity experiment
The experiment TRACE was performed in a transparent sheet—like cell with 1 mm thickness.
Details Of the experimental set—up and procedure are given in [5, 6]. Solidiﬁcation was controlled
by applying temperatures and cooling rates at the bottom and the top of the solidiﬁcation
volume. While the thermal gradient was almost constant, the cooling—rate was increased by a
factor of 10 from —0.2 K / min for columnar growth to —2.0 K / min for the transition to equiaxed
dendritiC growth. Table 1 summarizes the experimental, thermodynamical and thermophysical
parameters, accompanied by some numerical parameters needed for the phase—ﬁeld simulations.
Figure 1 shows an image taken from the experiment at steady—state columnar growth, and ﬁgure
2 during the GET, which occurs 375 s after increasing the cooling—rate to —2.0 K / min. Between
the two images, the columnar front was grown 1.5—2.0 mm.

4. Numerical simulation
The physical and numerical parameters that we used in our simulations are listed in table 1. The
MICRESS code was used to solve numerically the phase ﬁeld (Eqn 1 t0 4) and diffusion equation
(Eqn 5). Two—dimensional and three dimensional phase ﬁeld simulations were performed.
Concerning the two—dimensional calculation domain, a rectangular box of 450 ,um height was
used. The calculations start with a homogeneous melt at a given temperature gradient (see
table 1) where three nuclei of solid primary phase are disposed at some undercooling and equal
spacings 0n the bottom side of the calculation domain. We performed a study Of the inﬂuence
of dendrite spacing by varying the width of the calculation domain between 450 ,um and 1350
am. The grid spacing for all simulations is 0.75 am. For the three—dimensional calculations, the
simulation domain is a box of 150 X 150 X 450 ,um3. Only one nuclei is disposed in the corner
of the calculation domain. In all simulations, the temperature gradient is ﬁxed and constant
in one direction. Only the cooling rate is Changing from —0.2 K / min to —2.0 K / min to promote
GET. A moving calculation domain was used in which the distance from the dendrite tips to
the top boundary of the moving calculation domain is ﬁxed. In a ﬁrst stage of the simulation,
a columnar dendritiC structure is allowed to evolve in order to reach a steady state growth.
The cooling rate is ﬁxed to —0.2 K/min. In a second stage, the cooling rate is increased to
—2.0 K / min and nucleation is allowed, using a critical nucleation undercooling and nucleation

density for randomly oriented seeds in the melt. We suppose that the formation of equiaxed
dendrites is controlled by heterogeneous nucleation during the microgravity experiment. The
critical nucleation of undercooling is varied during the different simulations. The nucleation
density is supposed to be equal to the equiaxed grain density (Ne, Tab. 1).

5.]. Steady state
Steady state columnar growth in 2D is obtained after 15000 s. In ﬁgure 3, we have represented the
ATC—ﬁeld at t=15000s (section 2). We can distinguish three columnar dendrites with secondary
branches corresponding to the three initials nuclei growing along the temperature gradient. In
ﬁgure 4 undercooling proﬁles are shown along the dendrite tip (solid line 1) and in between
the dendrites (dashed line 2). In the insert of ﬁgure 4, the solid and dashed horizontal lines
correspond to the maximal undercoolings for the proﬁles along the dendrite tip and between the
dendrites respectively. In steady state growth, the maximum of ATC is constant and equal to
approximately 18.1 K. As observed by Badillo and Beekermann [9] and Dong and Lee [10], the
maximum undercooling is situated on the symmetry line between columnar branches. Several
2D simulations were performed using different experimentally observed dendrites spacings of
150, 300, 450 um corresponding to 450, 900, 1350 um calculation domain width. We have
observed differences smaller than 1% concerning the value of the ﬁnal maximum constitutional
undercooling in the bulk. In all cases the results shows that the maximum constitutional
undercooling is located between the dendrites.

To be able to describe the growth of several dendrites in 3D with a spacing of 300 am we
used symmetry conditions on the calculations domain sides to simulate the presence of the other
dendrites. On ﬁgure 5, we have plotted the phase ﬁeld contour ($20.5) of a dendrite at t=8000
s, for a crystallographic orientation of 45 O. For the orientation of 0 O, the secondary arms
are growing along the domain sides. Like the 2D simulations, we observed a maximal solutal
undercooling between the dendrites equal to 7.8 K. Orientation (0 0 or 45 O ) plays also a minor
role on the value of undercooling. We have noticed that the time to reach constant value of the
constitutional undercooling was lower in 3D (around 8000 s) than in 2D (15000 s).

We performed a comparison with the predictions of the KGT—model [7, 8] concerning the
value of the constitutional undereooling in 2D and 3D. In the KGT—model, the undercooling is
calculated at the dendrite tip, but the differences to the maximum bulk value are small here.

Furthermore a stability constant 0* appears, which is 0.0253 (2 1/ (4712)) in the standard model.
It was found [6] that a value of 0.007 should be used to obtain best ﬁt to experiments. Using
these two different values of 0*, we have summarized the values for the undercooling obtained
from the KGT model in 2D (ATED), in 3D (ATED) and phase ﬁeld in table 2. We have seen
that the phase ﬁeld simulations result in values of constitutional undercooling of 7.8 K in 3D and
18.1 K in 2D giving a ratio (Q) of 2.30. The geometry that we obtained by phase ﬁeld can not
be described correctly by the KGT model7 which assumes a parabolic shape. Nevertheless, we
can remark that the 2D result of phase ﬁeld is an average of the KGT values. For 3D simulation7
the phase ﬁeld results are above the highest KGT prediction, but Close to the value (0*20007)
used to ﬁt the experimental results [6].

We introduced seeds randomly positioned and oriented in liquid zone of the simulation domain.
The initial rnierostrueture was taken from the previous steady state simulation. We have used
the same nucleation density Ne (Tab. 1) for all simulations7 only the nucleation undereooling
(ATn) varies between 8.5 K and 20 K for 3D and 17 K and 27 K for 2D simulations. For 2D
simulations7 if the nucleation undereooling is lower than 27 K7 we observed equiaxed grains
at the front of columnar dendrites (ﬁgure 6). Above 27 K7 nucleation is not possible and the
rnierostrueture remains columnar (ﬁgure 7). For 3D simulations below 20 K7 CET occurs (ﬁgure
8). Above 20 K7 the dendritiC structure remains columnar (ﬁgure 9). It is also important to
notice that 3D simulation allow to observe the Change of rnierostrueture 0f the columnar zone.
We can Clearly distinguish that ternary arms are developing orthogonal to secondary arms side
because of the Change of the cooling rate. The experimental measurements [6] show that CET
occurs with the nucleation undereooling of nuclei situated between 8.5 K and 12 K.
Before CET occurs and the new nuCleated grains blocked the columnar dendrites7 a transient

between 1.5 and 2.0 mm. On ﬁgure 107 we have plotted the length of this transition zone

experimental measurement are represented by the gray square. We see that for low value of
nucleation underCOOling the 3D—m0del is Close to the experimental results. Nevertheless the
fact that the 3D phase ﬁeld results are not localised into the grey domain can be attributed to
heat redistribution during the cooling rate Change. In experiments7 the redistribution of heat

6. Conclusion
We have shown in this work that phase ﬁeld model can be very efﬁcient in modeling the columnar
t0 equiaxed transition. The ﬁrst 3D phase ﬁeld simulations of GET have been presented. The
model describe correctly the GET using the experimental value of nucleation undereoolings
and predicts With good accuracy the length of the columnar zone before GET. But the most
important is that 2D simulations are not describing experiments as good as 3D simulations.
The value of nucleation undereoolings, and the transition length for example, are very far from
experiments.
