ABSTRACT. Baked ceramic aggregates (fritted clay, arcillite) have been used for plant research both on the ground and
in microgravity. Optimal control of water and air within the root zone in any gravity environment depends on physical
and hydraulic properties of the aggregate, which were evaluated for 0.25—1-mm and 1—2-mm particle size distribu-
tions. The maximum bulk densities obtained by any packing technique were 0.68 and 0.64 g-cm-3 for 0.25—1-mm and
1—2-mm particles, respectively. Wettable porosity obtained by inﬁltration with water was z65%, substantially lower
than total porosity of z74%. Aggregate of both particle sizes exhibited a bimodal pore size distribution consisting of
inter-aggregate macropores and intra-aggregate micropores, with the transition from macro- to microporosity begin-
ning at volumetric water content of z36% to 39%. For inter-aggregate water contents that support optimal plant
growth there is 45% change in water content that occurs over a relatively small matric suction range of 0—20 cm H20
for 0.25—1-mm and 0 to —10 cm H20 for 1—2-mm aggregate. Hysteresis is substantial between draining and wetting
aggregate, which results in as much as a z10% to 20% difference in volumetric water content for a given matric
potential. Hydraulic conductivity was approximately an order of magnitude higher for 1—2-mm than for 0.25—1-mm
aggregate until signiﬁcant drainage of the inter-aggregate pore space occurred. The large change in water content for
a relatively small change in matric potential suggests that signiﬁcant differences in water retention may be observed
in microgravity as compared to earth.

Baked ceramic aggregates (fritted Clay, arcillite) have been ous studies ranging from plant carbon balance (McCree, 1983),
