ABSTRACT
Individuals Who adapt positively to an inhospitable or extreme environment can derive beneﬁt
from their experiences. This positive effect may include an initial improvement in mental health as
someone adjusts to the environment (adaptation) as well as more sustained personal growth during
the mission (salutogenesis). We reVieW relevant ﬁndings from our prior work, including two post-
mission surveys of astronauts and cosmonauts, and three studies of crewmembers during missions
in a space station simulator, the Mir space station, and the International Space Station (188). We
also present new analyses showing evidence for adaptation to 188 missions. This ﬁnding replicates
our previous results from the simulation study, but this effect was not found on the Mir. A better
understanding of psychological adaptation and salutogenesis during space ﬂight should help us
develop strategies to enhance crewmembers’ in-ﬂight stress tolerance and post-ﬂight adjustment.
