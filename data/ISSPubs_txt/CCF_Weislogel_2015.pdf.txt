"5","Abstract
It would be signiﬁcantly easier to design ﬂuid systems for spacecraft if the ﬂuid
phases behaved similarly to those on earth. In this research an open 15.8O wedge-
sectioned Channel is employed to separate bubbles from a two-phase ﬂow in a micro-
gravity environment. The bubbles appear to rise in the Channel and coalesce With
the free surface in much the same way as would bubbles in a terrestrial environ-
ment, only the combined effects of surface tension, wetting, and conduit geometry
replace the role of buoyancy. The host liquid is drawn along the Channel by a pump
and nonoondensible gas bubbles are injected into it near the Channel vertex at the
Channel inlet. Control parameters include bubble volume, bubble frequency, liq-
uid volumetric ﬂow rate, and Channel length. The asymmetrically conﬁned bubbles
are driven in the cross-ﬂow direction by capillary forces until they at least become
inscribed Within the section or until they come in contact With the free surface,
whereupon they usually coalesce and leave the ﬂow. The merging of bubbles en-
hances, but does not guarantee, the latter. The experiments are performed aboard
the International Space Station as a subset of the Capillary Channel Flow experi-
ments. The ﬂight hardware is commanded remotely and continuously from ground
stations during the tests and an extensive array of experiments is conducted identi-
fying numerous bubble ﬂow regimes and regime transitions depending on the ratio
and magnitude of the gas and liquid volumetric ﬂow rates. The breadth of the pub-
licly available experiments is conveyed herein primarily by narrative and by regime
maps, Where transitions are approximated by simple expressions immediately useful
for the purposes of design and deeper analysis.
1 Introduction
Separation of bubbles from a liquid medium is a critical, but non—triVial task aboard
spacecraft due to the absence of a net gravitational force that precludes using buoy-
ancy as a strong separation mechanism. Though any number of methods are pursued
to replace the role of gravity in the multi—phase ﬂuid systems of spacecraft, the ever-
present capillary force Which exploits the combination of surface tension, wetting,
and system geometry provides a natural and often passive solution. In Fig. 1 is
sketched an open wedge Channel in a zero-gravity environment along Which a steady
forced liquid ﬂows at ﬂow rate 62;. The free surface proﬁle adjusts so that its lo-
cal capillary pressure balances the convective and Viscous pressure losses along the
Channel. Bubbles introduced upstream near the Channel vertex are asymmetrically
conﬁned by the planar side walls of the wedge and through a combination of mech-
anisms the bubbles are forced in a cross—stream direction away from the vertex until
they reach approximately inscribed elevations. If the bubbles are large enough, the
Channel long enough, and the liquid ﬂow rate low enough, there Will be ample time
for the bubbles to reach the free surface, coalesce, and leave the ﬂow. In doing so,
this simple conduit geometry performs a passive bubble separation operation in an
analogous manner to simple bubble rise in a buoyant open Channel ﬂow.

When occurring in the nearly weightless environment of an orbiting spacecraft,

such processes possess unique Characteristics attributable to the large length scale
capillary phenomena possible there: The ﬂows are often inertial With highly under-
damped low frequency free surfaces, the evidence of buoyancy 0n unconﬁned bubble
motion is truly negligible, and capillary ﬂow rates increase by many orders of magni-
tude (N 106-f01d), as do various dimensionless groups including the ratio of surface
roughness t0 Characteristic container length (N 103—f01d). Regarding research, the
larger length scale systems allow accurate construction of increasingly complex con-
tainers and conduits consisting of transparent materials With full optical access. Re-
garding applications, the demonstration of nearly full scale systems in the relevant
reduced-gravity environment increases technology readiness levels adding conﬁdence
to both spacecraft technology developers and adopters. Terrestrial research along
such lines is extensive, but naturally limited to milli—to—microscale systems Where
Viscous forces play a signiﬁcant role—the majority of work focusing on conﬁned bub-
bles in symmetric geometries such as Circular tubes, parallel plates, and rectangular
Channels (i.e., [1]). Signiﬁcant progress concerning the hydrodynamics of bubbles in
shear ﬂows is reported and reviewed by [2]. For a sample of terrestrial microﬂuidic
bubble separation and generation methods see [3], [4], [5], [6], [7], and in particular
for the wedge geometry see [8] and [9].

For a quiescent liquid, the fundamental problem of asymmetrically-conﬁned bub-
ble migration in a wedge is addressed in terrestrial experiments by [10] and [11] and
in drop tower experiments by [12]. The passive migration of such bubbles through
a forced convective ﬂow is introduced by [8] and [9] With recent experiments also
performed in the microgravity environment reported by [12]. The analytic approach

"7","t0 the problem often begins from the simpliﬁed sketch at left in Fig. 1, Where in
the narrow wedge half—angle limit 04 << 1 the bubble is approximated as a modu-
lated disc-like body Characterized by radii of curvature R1, R2, and RC (a “squeezed
bubble’ according to [10] and an ‘air puddle’ according to [11]). Because R1 < R2,
the capillary under—pressure in the liquid at the narrower end of the bubble is lower
than that of the broader end, and the resulting pressure gradient drives the liquid
upward displacing the bubble downward.

Employing a genetic algorithm to a force balance on such a bubble, [10] consider
the impact of liquid Viscosity, partial wetting and contact line pinning, dynamic
contact angle, and the presence of thin ﬁlms on the inertia of the ‘bubble’ (Via the
liquid). For their laminar ﬂows, Metz et a1. ﬁnd that Viscous resistance dominates
the ﬂow near the vertex When the bubble is more 01' less a modulated disc and
velocities are high. Dynamic contact line affects arising from local Viscous normal
stresses play a more important role as velocities decrease and the bubble eventually
achieves a more spherical shape.

Using an energy balance, [11] employs the same narrow wedge limit 04 << 1 With
25130 / (51:2 — 5131) << 1 to ﬁnd the transient bubble center migration position :ch in two
distinct Viscous regimes: a near-verteX regime Where

Where 0, ,u, Vi), and t are the liquid surface tension, liquid dynamic Viscosity, bubble
volume, and time, and X = 1.1 is a Viscous resistance coefﬁcient. The investigations
of both Metz et a1. and Reyssat do well to predict accompanying data.

As systems increase in size, inertial forces dominate Viscous resistance and the
simpliﬁed schematic of Fig. 1 gives way to more complex behavior. Fig. 2 provides
images of a sealed wedge vessel that is mounted to an experiment rig Which is
placed inside a drag shield and dropped 21.6 In in a drop tower providing a low-
gravity test duration of 2.1 s, [13]. Here, a wedge conduit of acute included angle
204 = 15.50 is shown oriented vertex upward though tilted With respect to g at angle
0 g 7 g 900 With a bubble of known volume centered and balanced. The tilt angle
7 allows further control of the initial condition. Release of the experiment into free
fall reduces the body force by a factor of ~ 10—5 and the asymmetrically conﬁned
bubble is driven downward by capillary forces.

In Fig. 3 are presented ﬁve such passive capillarity-driven bubble migration
experiments performed in a drop tower. The bubble volume and ﬂuid types are
listed for each example shown. Relevant nominal thermophysical properties for 10

provides a Viscous example more in line With the experiments performed by [10].
The more inertial ﬂow in Fig. 3b reveals early stage opposing corner ﬂows that
create a small geyser distorting the bubble enroute to its spherical conﬁguration.
The initially larger, longer bubble of Fig. 3C distorts signiﬁcantly to the point of
break-up. In this example, the ﬁssioned bubbles re—rnerge migrating further away
from the vertex toward the new inscribed elevation. However, re-rnergers do not
always occur as shown in Fig. 3d. Tilting the test cell, as noted by 7 in Fig. 20,
allows much larger single bubbles to be studied Without break-up. Such a test is
shown in Fig. 3e, Where 7 = 82°. Following a step reduction in gravity, the interior
corner ﬂows are again observed to Wick across the vertex Where they collide forming
a geyser. The distorted bubble avoids the breakup observed in 30, but the highly
inertial capillary ﬂow displaces the oscillating non-Circular projection of the bubble
well away from the vertex. A sequence of overlayed images from a similar drop
tower experiment employing a particle seeded liquid is shown in Fig. 4a Where wake
vortices are obvious as also observed by [10]. Inertia in the recirculating ﬂuid is
sufﬁcient to carry the bubble past the ideal inscribed elevation $bci beyond Which
capillary forces no longer provide a motive force. For the end state images shown
for each test in Fig. 3, in 3a the over-darnped bubble is creeping toward its ideal
spherical inscribed elevation $bci. In 3b the bubble is slowly Circulating Clockwise
in the left eddy (ref. Fig. 4). In 30 and 3e all bubbles are still moving past their
ideal inscribed elevations, but in 3d the bubbles appear to be caught in their own
wake vortices Which act to reverse their motion back in the direction of the vertex
and the inscribed location $bci.

ﬂow rate set to the minimum value of 0.5 rnl/s, as Will be described shortly. The
relevant properties and dimensions of the tests in Fig. 5 are listed in Table 1. The

With ,0 the density difference across the interface—approxirnately equal to the liquid
density. But the linear region of the Fig. 5b curves appear independent of bubble
volume Vb and wedge half—angle 04 as expressed in eq. 3.

Much is yet to be learned. For example, inertial bubble migration is further
complicated When an inertial convective liquid base state is present as investigated
herein. Coupling the capillary bubble migration ﬂow ﬁeld With the base ﬂow ﬁeld
produces a variety of outcomes that are not adequately understood. LOW volume
bubbles achieve essentially 10W inscribed elevations in regions Within the base ﬂow
boundary layer Where path lines are over-darnped. Larger inertial bubbles are driven
beyond their inscribed elevations Where free strearn—like developing base ﬂow veloci-
ties displace them downstream in such a manner that they are entrained in their own
recirculating wakes and driven back toward the vertex and their inscribed elevations.
This general behavior is depicted in Figs. 1 and 4b for a base ﬂow. Fig. 1 adds the
presence of a free surface. We note that such bubble motion reversals are also read-
ily observed in quiescent host liquids due to slight ﬂow geometry asymmetries; i.e.,
Fig. 3d. As Will be seen, and as identiﬁed by [12], the overshoot phenomena is less
pronounced as the liquid ﬂow rate is increased. But questions remain concerning
bubble elevations in such developing shear ﬂows. For example, do the bubbles drift
away from inscribed elevations? Are they forced into slightly conﬁned elevations?
Or both ( [2])?

The details of such phenomena are important to the design of large length scale
bubble separation processes and capillary ﬂuidic devices aboard spacecraft. They
are also ideally studied aboard spacecraft. Related microgravity experiments have
been performed aboard the International Space Station (188), but have focused on
irnbibing bubbly capillary ﬂows With ﬂow velocities that are intrinsically tied to ir-
regular and often tapering polygonal conduit geometry (i.e., [14], [15], and [16]). As
the large bubbles are displaced across the containers due to corner Wicking ﬂows,
smaller bubbles convect into narrow bubble bypass regions Where they are in turn
conﬁned and coalesce With the free surfaces of the larger bubbles. In this way such
constructs serve the function of passive phase separation. But in such experiments,
both liquid and gas ﬂows are coupled and capillarity—driven. In reference to the
ﬂow geometry of Fig. 1, the ability to drive the liquid ﬂow independently of the
gas ﬂow enables a Wide range of test conditions. Employing a pump and an open
wedge Channel of variable length, the Capillary Channel Flow experiments (CCF)
are conducted aboard the International Space Station (188) to collect a large un-
earthly data set to inspire advanced capillary ﬂuidics design as well as guide further
fundamental and applied research. The implications to terrestrial applications and

2 Regime Map Deﬁnitions, and Nomenclature
As a means of introducing most of the deﬁnitions and nomenclature for this work,
in Fig. 6 we provide a sketch of a generic ﬁxed bubble frequency ﬂow regime map for
a narrow open wedge Channel similar to that sketched in Fig. 1. For ﬁxed Channel
geometry, injected bubble frequency f , and ﬂuid properties including a perfectly
wetting liquid, each map Will be presented in terms of the gas Q9 and liquid Q;
volumetric ﬂow rates. The gas ﬂow rate is controlled by varying the bubble volume
Vb such that Q9 2 f 14,. As in related investigations (see [17] and many references
contained therein), the magnitude and ratio of Q9 and Q; determines the particular
regime. Flow conditions outside of these regimes are unsustainable in terms of time-
averaged steady liquid ﬂow. At least 6 regimes and 3 regime boundaries are identiﬁed
in Fig. 6. Each is named from the perspective of such Channels serving as lOW-gravity
passive bubble phase separation devices. A selection of representative images for
each regime and regime boundary described is provided in Fig. 7. Corresponding
deﬁnitions and descriptions are provided as follows:

1. 0% Singles: All single bubbles With 0% separation. In other words, the rel-
atively small bubbles do not reach the free surface. We (:all this the 0%
separation condition Where all bubbles convect through the exit of the open
wedge Channel.

2. Partial Singles: All single bubbles With partial separation. For the ﬁxed length
Channel, and for a variety of reasons, at least one of at least ten of these
relatively intermediate—sized bubbles reach the free surface, coalesce, and leave
the ﬂow. Only a portion of the bubbles convect through the Channel exit.

"15","3. 100% Singles: A11 single bubbles With 100% separation. 100% of these rela-
tively large single bubbles reach the free surface, coalesce, and leave the ﬂow.
N0 bubbles pass through the Channel outlet.

4. 0% Mergers: At least one of at least ten bubbles merge With each other With 0%
separation. The single bubbles may merge, and merged bubbles may merge,
and so on, but the merged bubbles are still not large enough to reach the free
surface for the ﬁxed length Channel. This is a 0% separation state since all
single and merged bubbles convect through the Channel eXit.

5. Partial Mergers: At least a portion of the bubbles merge With partial separa—
tion. Single, double-, triple—, and so on, mergers produce a variety of bubble
volumes, a portion of Which are large enough to reach the free surface, (:0—
alesce, and leave the ﬂow. Only a portion of the single as well as merged
bubbles convect through the Channel eXit. Here, ‘mergers’ deﬁnes bubble to
bubble coalescence events, While ‘Coalescence’ deﬁnes bubble to free surface
coalescence events.

6. 100% Mergers: A 100% separation state Where at least some bubbles are
observed to merge. Merger rates generally decrease With increasing Q9. N0
bubbles pass through the Channel outlet.

7. Single Phase Ingestion Limit: Without any bubbles injected, for ﬁxed Channel
dimensions, Q; is limited by the stability of the free surface and values of
Q; > le9 lead to collapse of the free surface near the Channel eXit and
periodic ingestion of ambient gas bubbles into the liquid ﬂow 100p (Choking).

8. Bubble Enhanced Stability: 0% single bubbles enhance the stability of the free
surface and allow Q; to achieve values above the ingestion limit le9.

9. Coalescence Enhanced Ingestion: The advent of bubbles leaving the free sur-
face results in an abrupt drop in the maximum value of Q; possible for the
ﬂow. Partial single— and increasingly merged—bubbles, towards 100% separa—
tion at intermediate to high gas ﬂow rates, continue to reduce the liquid depth
and thus ingestion limit le9.

The effect of wetting conditions on the regime maps is expected to be signiﬁcant,
[18]. We expect mergers to dominate behavior in interesting ways as Q; —> 0.

A brief narrative of the space experiment, components, procedures, and cali-
bration is provided before introducing the experimentally determined regime maps.
Following some discussion, simple heuristic arguments are used for effective predic-
tion of the regime boundaries.

3 CCF Story

The Capillary Channel Flow experiment (CCF) hardware was launched to the Inter-

national Space Station (188) aboard the Space Shuttle Discovery (STS—131) on April

5th, 2010. For all subsequent operations, the equipment is installed by an astronaut
NASA/TM—2015-218720 11

"
"16","into the Miorogravity Science Glovebox (MSG) facility of the Destiny Module of the
188, [19]. Once installed, the MSG is sealed, the equipment is powered, and the eX-
periment is commanded remotely and continuously from ground stations primarily
at ZARM—Bremen and PSU-Portland, but also from Astrium—Friedriohshafen and
NASA-MSFC as needed. The hardware includes three open test Channel geome-
tries: parallel plate, rectangular groove, and wedge Channels. Beginning December
27, 2010, CCF was ﬁrst operated 24 hours per day for 80 continuous days with the
parallel plate and rectangular Channels. The primary objective of these tests was
to determine the critical liquid ﬂow rates of such Channels that mark the collapse
of the free surface and the initiation of bubble ingestion—a condition often called
Choking by [20], and herein referred to as the ingestion limit le9 (refer to Fig. 7g).
A description of these experiments, including a more thorough reView of the exper-
iment equipment and function, is provided in [21]. Future CCF ISS experiments
with parallel plate and rectangular groove Channels are scheduled.

The ﬁrst operation of the wedge test Channel experiments began on September
13, 2011 and continued for 33 24-hour days. The results of these initial tests are
reported in part in [12]. These tests also identiﬁed the ingestion limits for this ge—
ometry, but included exploratory tests on bubble and bubbly ﬂows in the wedge
Channel where the upstream gas ﬂow boundary condition was that of a constant
volume reservoir. In this series of tests, short bursts of bubbles were studied such
that the upstream gas pressure did not decrease signiﬁcantly during the injection,
enabling the assumption of an essentially constant pressure gas reservoir condition.
This approach was effective in deﬁning a limited variety of ﬂow regimes as a function
of gas ﬂow rate, liquid ﬂow rate, and bubble frequency, but not always the bubble
volume, [12]. Conditions demarking the 100% passive bubble separation conditions
were also identiﬁed. Much was learned during the ﬁrst round of wedge Channel tests
not the least being the breadth of capabilities of the experiment hardware despite
the numerable Challenges presented when seeking to precisely control multi—phase
systems in a reduced-gravity environment, [22]. For example, the CCF ﬂight hard-
ware incorporates a minimum of four, what might be called, passive phase separation
devices in addition to the primary wedge test Channel which was designed to study
passive phase separation! Thus, there were many opportunities to destabilize the
system, invert the ﬂuid phases, and/ or otherwise leak or spill away the liquid con-
tents of the triply—contained system. Most fortunately, complete recovery following
all purposeful or inadvertent destabilizations was possible through nearly continuous
commanding of the experiment from the ground and sending over 200,000 commands
to 188 for CCF at average rates exceeding one per minute with peaks of over ﬁve
commands per minute.

A second operation of the wedge test Channel experiments continued for 40 24-
hour days beginning June 17, 2013. The ingestion limit investigations continued
during these operations, but extensive bubble phase separation tests using new
ﬁxed bubble volume conditions were conducted. It is these speciﬁc tests that are
the subject of this paper. The ﬁxed bubble volume approach combined with ample-
resolution real-time video downlink from the 188 provided a wealth of data that are
highly complimentary to the previous ‘Constant upstream pressure’ tests of [12]. A
brief reView of the CCF hardware is followed by system calibration data used to

"
"17","‘parachute’ into the desired experimental conditions and determine the uncertainty
limits of the measurements. Over 5,000 data points were collected for a variety
of conditions and these are presented here primarily in the form of regime maps.
The many regime transitions are discussed in light of simple idealized models that
describe much of the complex behaviours observed. Further insights are learned
from subsets of the data that quantify velocity ﬁelds, bubble coalescence lengths,
bubble merger transients, and more. The paper is concluded With a description of
the continued directions of the work highlighting the immediate application of the
results towards passive phase separations in lOW-gravity environments, as well as in
microﬁuidics systems on earth. The unique, approximately 1TB dataset and Video
log including image rectiﬁcation algorithms, recommended instructions for use, etc.
is made publicly available following a request for access at http://psi.nasa.g0v.

4 CCF Flow Loop Overview

A highly simpliﬁed schematic of only the pertinent components of the CCF ﬂow loop
is presented in Fig. 8. Referring to the ﬁgure, a self—priming external Micropump
GB-P25 gear pump (a) is employed, Which at low ﬂow rates, pumps liquids and
gases equivalently. Vane structures in the Phase Separation Chamber (b) reroute
the HFE-7500 liquid around the coalesced Nitrogen gas bubbles and a screen serves
as a bubble trap. Thus, only liquid passes through the Phase Separation Chamber
(b) and into the Flow Preparation Chamber (C) Where a converging duct delivers a
highly laminar, though developing, ﬂow to the Test Channel (d).

The pressure of the system is set by a 60 mm diameter meniscus in What is re-
ferred to as the Compensation Tube (e) connected to the Flow Preparation Chamber
(C) upstream of the Test Unit (f). The transparent Compensation Tube (e) is open
to the ambient gas environment of the Test Channel (d). The quartz Test Chan-
nel is a 1580 open wedge 48 mm in length and 30 mm in height. A sliding lid
allows variation of the free surface length 0.1 g L g 48 mm Within the ﬁeld of
View. The Channel is backlit by a diffused incandescent source and the two Hitachi
HV—C20 Series 640 pX by 480 pX color CCD camera ﬁelds of View are identiﬁed by
the red dashed domains in Fig. 8. Bubbles are injected % 2 mm upstream of the
Test Channel inlet from a 223 mm long, 0.8 mm OD, 0.6 mm ID cannula (g) With
centerline 3.6 mm from the Channel vertex. The gas ﬂow is driven by a gas plunger
(h) delivering 0.0273 3 Q9 3 273 ml/s, Which is regulated using a high speed Festo
MHE2—MSlH-3/20-M7-K solenoid valve (i) capable of a Wide range of frequencies
0.01 g f g 10 HZ and duty cycles 0.001 g d g 10 s. Further geometric details
of the ﬂow path are conveyed in the half—section solid model of Fig. 9, including a
more faithful depiction of the cannula conﬁguration. The entrance region leading
to the test Channel is an elliptic contraction from the Flow Preparation Chamber.
The eXit contraction begins 19.5 mm downstream of the test section and consists of
a rather abrupt transition to a 10.7 mm ID tube that is centered With respect to
the Test Channel height at 15 mm.

During the tests, bubbles coalescing With and leaving through the free surface, at
times, eject droplets that ﬂoat or ﬂy Within the Test Unit until colliding, sometimes

rebounding, and ultimately adhering to the Test Unit interior walls. Such “splash-
ing’ in addition to ingestions and other interface destabilizations lead to capillary
connections outside the Test Channel that leak liquid away by capillarity. These
splash and leak rates were measured and found negligible compared to the pump
ﬂow rates qump for the tests conducted. However, over time these liquid losses
accumulate large amounts of liquid in the Test Unit. Fortunately, this liquid could
be recovered by either drawing the liquid through a Liquid Recovery Port (j), 01'
by Closing the slider (k) and running the pump at a high ﬂow rate such that an
under-pressure in the Test Channel returned the liquid by suction Via an unbroken
capillary connection past the slider surfaces and t0 the liquid throughout the Test
Unit. These liquid recovery methods would almost certainly not have worked if the
liquid was not perfectly wetting. Other valves (1)(m)(n) are employed along With a
liquid reservoir and plunger (0) t0 re—position the ﬂuid phases between tests.

A custom Electrical Ground Support Equipment (EGSE) interface is tailored
for telemetry With NASA’s Telescience Resource Kit (TReK). Exactly 494 discrete
states are monitored at 1 HZ, 82 of Which are directly manipulable by the experiment
operator team. Only 36 0f the states are critical to this report and include system
temperatures, pressures, valve states, ﬂow rates, ﬂuid levels, etc. Key control pa-
rameters include pump ﬂow rate qump, gas plunger volume displacement rate V1
(ml/s), plunger volume V1 (m1), slider position L (mm), bubble valve frequency f
(HZ), and bubble valve duty cycle d (s). During each test, data is collected manu-
ally from the EGSE display and entered into spreadsheets, generating control curves

of these tests, 5,315 data points were collected requiring hundreds of thousands of
keystroke entries. Accompanying the data are individual GMT time—stamped Video
recordings linked to the precise conditions of each test.

Both data and Video logs are made publicly available at http://psi.nasa.g0v.
Suggestions concerning the structure and use of the archive are presented in part
in Appendix A. Upon completion of the experiment operations, the telemetry logs
are extracted from the TReK databases to correct typographical, transcription, and
omissions errors that occurred during the manual collection of data. The majority of
the data collected is presented here in the form of regime maps for either ﬁxed bubble
frequency 01' ﬁxed bubble volume conditions. These approaches are all enabled by
the ability to deliver known bubble volumes at desired frequencies, as conﬁrmed by
in—ﬁight calibrations to ensure this capability.

Fig. 8, P1 is measured in the gas line just downstream of the gas reservoir h and P2
is measured in the Flow Preparation Chamber C just upstream of the test Channel.
A zeroth order approach assumes a steady process Where the gas Within the cannula

:|:12% While that for the largest bubble bubble is less than :|:5%. Uncertainty of
bubble volume determines the uncertainty of the gas ﬂow rate, and indirectly, the
liquid ﬂow rate in situations Where gas bubbles leave the Test Channel exit as Will
be discussed. The results of calibration experiments comparing measured spherical
bubble volumes to predictions using eq. 6 are shown in Fig. 10b. A ﬁt coefﬁcient
in eq. 6 is once again expected to correct for un—modelled effects such as added
resistances in the bubble valve, but we ﬁnd here that none is needed for bubble
volume predictions Within typically :|:7%, as identiﬁed in Fig. 10b. Thus, measured
Q9 uncertainties are on average ,3 :I: 7%. Eqs. 5 and 6 are used to predict the test

and presented in Fig. 12 for 6 = 0, 0.003, 0.031, and 0.05. Trends of both initially
decreasing or increasing P1 are observed, and though constant pressures are never
achieved, these experiments seek states Where P1* — P2* approaches a. steady value,
producing a. nearly steady n0n—zer0 value for Q9. Such is only possible for 6 > 0.
This capability is the signiﬁcant difference between the current experiments and
those of [12] Where 6 = 0 and experiments were performed over short durations for

5.2 Liquid Flow Rate Q;
The schematic of Fig. 13 provides a further simpliﬁed View of the ﬂow 100p. During
each run, the system contained Within the dashed boundary in the ﬁgure is slightly
pressurized as gas is injected into it. As shown in §5.1, this pressurization is limited
by the ratio of the mass of gas injected during each test to the initial mass of gas
in the large volume system V2. In agreement With the foregoing analysis for the
volume of gas downstream of the cannula V2, considering the worst case of a 2.8%
compression and average compressions of f, 0.1 :I: 0.04% for all tests conducted, the
gas phase Within this dashed region may be effectively considered incompressible
during each individual test. Following from this assumption, a volumetric ﬂow rate
balance may be applied to the Test Channel, Where at steady state Qm = Qout.
The controlled volumetric ﬂow rates are the gas injection rate Q9 E ng = f Vb
and the pump ﬂow rate qump. Referring to Fig. 7, by counting single and/or
merged bubbles, review of the Video data readily yields values for the rate of gas
leaving the Test Channel through the free surface Qgsout and through the Channel
exit ngut. When bubbles are injected into the ﬂow, the pressure increases in the
primary Circulation 100p sketched in Fig. 13 and a portion of liquid leaving the
Phase Separation Chamber is diverted to the slightly lower but constant pressure
Compensation Tube. This rate is denoted by QlCT. At steady state the Phase
Separation Chamber collects all gas entering it but passes only liquid, leump. Thus,

Where leout represents liquid leaving the Channel through the free surface Via droplet

present and aforementioned capillary liquid leak rate from the Channel. Speciﬁc tests

the long duration decrease of the liquid level in the Compensation Tube, in the
absence of bubbles With a fully open slider L = 48 mm, the liquid leak rate could be
correlated With qump to ﬁnd Queak % 0.0099 — 0.0024qump (ml/s). This linearized
relationship suggests that Queak = 0 When qump % 4.08 ml/s, suggesting further
that the Channel is continuously leaking for all tests, albeit at varying rates, since
qump < 4.08 ml/s for the Wide majority of tests conducted. This correlation
also implies that for values of qump > 4.08 ml/s the leak rate takes negative values
implying suction of liquid from outside the Test Channel back into loop, as described
earlier as a method employed to recover leaked liquid to the ﬂow loop. For the range
of ﬂow rates 0.38 g Q; g 3.0 ml/s it is found that 0.009 2 Queak 2 0.003 ml/s
Which conﬁnes the leak rate between 0.1% and 1.8% of Q; for all tests conducted.
Thus: by negleCting leout and Qlleak: and by applying qump : Qlout + ngut and
Qgsout = ng‘n — ngut, eq. 15 reduces to
QlCT % Qgsout- (16)
It is then found that
Ql E Qlin % qump _ nguta (17)
Which is used to determine the liquid ﬂow rates into the test Channel since both
quantities on the right hand side are readily measured. For the majority of tests
performed at 01' above the 100% separation condition ngut = 0 and the liquid inﬂow
rate is equal to the pump ﬂow rate, Q; 2 qump. The quantitative results of [12]
were largely restricted to this 100% separation condition.
The pump ﬂow rate qump is calibrated in—ﬂight using the ﬂow meter accurate
to :|:0.1 ml/s to ﬁnd the liquid ﬂow rate Q; = 0.987qump — 0.11 ml/s . Thus, Q;
uncertainties are expected to be as high as :|:25% for the lowest ﬂow rates of 0.38
ml/s, but ,3 :I: 4% for ﬂow rates at and above 3 ml/s. As a result, the lowest
accuracy ﬂow rate measurements arise for low Q; and the highest values of Q9
Where the single or merged bubbles do not leave through coalescence With the free
surface (0% separation states). But uncertainties in Q9 contribute little under these
restrictive conditions and Q; uncertainties are expected to peak at :|:21% at the
lowest 62;, While average uncertainties in Q; are calculated to be :|:7%. Recall that
Q9 average uncertainties are also coincidentally :|:7%, With worst cases of :|:12%
for the lowest gas ﬂow rates and less than :|:5% for the highest. Thus, the ﬂow
rate measurement accuracy increases With increasing ﬂow rate and :|:7% serves as a
nominal estimate for the majority of data presented herein.

5.4 Data Reduction: Bubble Velocity Proﬁle

Full CFD computations of developing forced single phase liquid ﬂow through the
wedge Channel are conducted by [23], but computations accounting for the presence
of highly deformable inertial bubbles are incomplete. Particularly for larger bubbles,
the liquid ﬂow ﬁeld is highly perturbed often by their inertial capillary cross ﬂow
trajectories. Speciﬁc calibration tests are presented here to determine the velocity
ﬁeld using the bubbles themselves; in effect determining the ‘bubble velocity proﬁle’
of the wedge ﬂow geometry Without resolving smaller scale structures such as wakes,
eddies, waves, and disturbances to boundary layers, though all of these are observed.

In general, the various Video events are further digitized to determine statistical
transient free surface proﬁles and bubble cross sections, volumes, positions, and
velocities. Sample Video frames at 3 HZ of single bubble trajectories are overlayed
in Fig. 14 for 10 bubbles of increasing volume at ﬁxed ﬂow rate Q; = 1.86 rnl/s and
fully open slider, L = 48 mm. The frames are selected that assure the alignment
shown at right in the ﬁgure Where the wedge section is sketched to scale identifying
the degree to Which the bubbles are or are not inscribed Within the Channel. These
ﬂows are labeled as 0% singles and from eq. 17, Ql % qump — f W. As identiﬁed in
Fig. 14, the positions of the bubbles are readily tracked by digitizing the locations of
their rightmost edge 5131,, Which Closely approximates both the projected area centroid
and the halfway point between minimum and maximum :r—coordinate elevations of
the bubble surface mm. This is because the bubbles move downstream along nearly
inscribed paths and are thus nearly spherical. For example, the leading edge bubble
position data for the tests of Fig. 14 are presented in Fig. 15 With bubble volumes
noted. Comparing 51:1, elevations at z = 35 mm With ideally inscribed elevations
listed reveals that for these data the bubbles take inscribed or higher elevations.

For the case of Fig. 15, the blue data suggest Viscous (over-darnped) boundary
layer behaviour for small bubbles near the wedge vertex (Vi, f, 0.049 ml) and the red
data inertial (under—darnped) free strearn—like behaviour nearer to the free surface
as bubbles increase in size (Vi9 > 0.072 ml). Values in yellow 0.049 f, Vb f, 0.072 ml
appear to be transitional, breaking the otherwise monotonic relationship between
increasing bubble elevation £131, With bubble volume Vi).

As computed by [23], the velocity ﬁeld experiences an abrupt Change at z = 0
at the free surface Where the no slip condition is replaced by the zero shear stress
condition. With knowledge of this fact, fully-developed ﬂow entrance lengths Le are
estimated assuming only free surface (FS) or only fully enclosed conduits (EC) to

5.5 Discussion

From Figs. 15 and 18, in the boundary layer region of the ﬂow a slight drift away
from the vertex is observed to Which local hydrodynamics may contribute such as
Saffman lift, but such weakly non-parallel trajectories are observed from numerical
simulations of the ﬂow that show similar magnitude behavior due to local accel-
erations caused by the increasingly occluding free surface deﬂection and Channel
eXit contraction effects, [23]. As suggested in Fig. 9, the exit contraction eventu-
ally drives all bubbles toward the eXit tube elevation. An example full 3-D CFD
simulation of the single phase liquid ﬂow ﬁeld provides a more quantitative picture
in Fig. 19 (see [23] for further details). Thus, one might expect that nearer to the
Channel eXit, small bubbles Will be weakly driven away from the vertex and away
from inscribed elevations, While large bubbles Will be driven toward the Channel
vertex and toward or even past their fully inscribed elevations. Without further
insights from theoretical and numeric analysis it is difﬁcult to assess the magnitude
of such effects though they are Clearly less apparent With increasing Q; as might be
expected.

The simple ﬂow Visualization from drop tower tests shown in Fig. 4, and reported
also by [12], reveal that for a quiescent liquid the inertial capillary bubble migration
produces wake vortices that persist in carrying the bubble signiﬁcantly past their
inscribed elevations. When a base state liquid ﬂow is present the liquid velocity pro-
ﬁle convects the bubble downstream and increasingly away from these trailing wake
vortices. As depicted in Fig. 4b, we currently conjecture that it is the recirculation
of these vortices that results in the oscillatory nature of the intermediate—to—large
bubbles at intermediate liquid ﬂow rates. Such effects are less noticeable as Q;
increases (e.g., compare Fig. 15 With 18). It is also noted that at high bubble fre-
quencies, subsequent bubble injections perturb previous bubble trajectories leading
to further complexities of the ﬂow.

5.6 Minimum Bubble Volume, mem
From Figs. 14 and 17 it is Clear that the elevation Where the bubbles ﬁrst become
inscribed is central to the bubble behavior. For a fully developed parallel ﬂow,
Whether 01' not the bubbles remain at inscribed elevations is dependent on the sign
of the lift force in the asymmetric shearing ﬂow. Both the direction and magnitude
of these forces are yet to be learned. In fact, for our developing ﬂow, according
to [2] these forces may both Change dramatically across the boundary layer. We
do observe that for a ﬂow rate of 2.85m1/s and Closed slider the smaller bubbles in
Fig. 18 take essentially parallel paths at essentially inscribed elevations. This might
suggest a negative lift force if any. But we also observe in Fig. 15 for a ﬂow rate
of 1.86 ml/s and an open slider With a 48 mm long free surface that such bubbles
migrate slightly away from the vertex — the smaller bubbles migrating away from
inscribed elevations and the larger bubbles away from slightly conﬁned elevations.
This observation might suggest a potential combination of positive lift and capillary
forces. However, we also acknowledge that the combined effects of the developing
ﬂow, free surface deﬂections, and the eXit contraction contribute to non-parallel
convective components, the degree of Which is presently uncertain. Guidance from
further theoretical and full CFD analyses is expected to Clarify these issues.

With conﬁrmation that the bubbles generally follow their inscribed trajectories,
Fig. 20 provides a sketch of the wedge Channel cross-section, liquid free surface,
and minimum static inscribed spherical bubble volume that is tangent to the free
surface. Values for key geometric quantities for these models are listed in Table
2. Though several model free surface conﬁgurations might be considered based

employed uniformly in all maps to follow. Figs. 22-27 present maps for f = 0.5,
0.75, 1, 1.25, 1.5, and 2 HZ using the same coordinate scale for ease of comparison.
Approximate regime boundaries are sketched by eye on each map. The maps are
combined in Fig. 28 With data and regime map boundaries provided in 28a and With
regime boundaries and shaded regimes provided in 28b. Inspection of such maps
elucidates several immediate conclusions. Other insights are drawn from inspection
of the Video data for each test condition. The observations listed here culminate in
the generic map of Fig. 6 and correspond to the various ﬁxed frequency regimes and
regime boundaries associated With that ﬁgure in §2:

1. LOW gas ﬂow rates imply small gas bubbles that are too sparse to merge at
elevated liquid ﬂow rates 62;. Single bubble volumes less than mein = 0.20 ml
cannot reach the free surface, coalesce, and separate.

2. Single bubbles With volumes slightly less or slightly greater than mein = 0.20
ml on occasion reach the free surface, coalesce, and leave the ﬂow. ngm 2
bemm is identiﬁed in all maps Where applicable. Bubble separations are
enhanced due to the capillary overshoot depicted by the bubble position data
exempliﬁed in Figs. 4, 15, 18, and the inset of Fig. 21. A leftward hook in the
vertical boundary between partial and 100% singles is observed near le9 due
to increased free surface curvature. The severity of the ‘hook’ in these maps
is muted compared to that of the different test conditions of [12].

3. Provided the Channel is of sufﬁcient length, single bubbles With Vb > mein
(Q9 > ngm) eventually reach the free surface, coalesce, and leave the ﬂow.

4. At low Q9 small bubbles inscribe Closer to the wedge vertex, well-Within the
boundary layer Where the liquid ﬂows are slower and mergers are enhanced.
Merged bubble volumes Vb < mem cannot reach the free surface, coalesce,
and separate.

5. Somewhat erratic mergers and multi—mergers lead to a distribution of bubble
volumes, some of Which exceed 14mm, reach the free surface, coalesce, and
leave the ﬂow.

6. If Vb > mem / 2, mergers create bubbles of volume larger than 14mm, and all
such bubbles eventually reach the free surface, coalescence, and leave the ﬂow.
Thus, if Q; is low enough the condition Q9 2 ngm / 2 2 bemm / 2 serves
as a delimiter for 100% separating double-Inergers. Mergers are enhanced for
increasing frequency f , increasing bubble volume 14,, and decreasing liquid
ﬂow rate Q; as easily observed in Fig. 28b.

7. The single phase liquid ingestion ﬂow rate leg approximately intersects the
backwards-extrapolated terminus of the bubble coalescence enhanced ingestion
boundary at Q9 % 0.

8. At high 62;, single bubbles of volume Vb < mem and frequency f > fmg
stabilize the free surface and permit liquid ﬂow rates slightly higher than
the ingestion limit le9. The stabilization is enhanced for increasing bubble
frequency as observed Fig. 28b. To be reported separately, it is found that
for Channel lengths L > 10 mm, bubbles injected into the ﬂow at frequencies
higher than the gas ingestion frequency fmg stave off the ingestion limit to ﬂow
rates as much as 22—fold the single phase ﬂow ingestion limit, [24]. The source
of this stabilization is still somewhat in question, but is likely attributable to
the altered time—averaged boundary condition at the inlet Which increases the
system pressure, decreasing the free surface curvature, and increasing the ﬂow
cross section in the test Channel allowing for higher ﬂow rates With reduced
Viscous resistance. Note that fmg is the frequency of gas bubble ingestion into
the liquid stream at the Channel eXit at leg.

9. At high 62;, for Vb > WWW, single bubbles coalesce With the free surface
reducing the local depth of the liquid and enhancing ingestion of ambient gas
through the free surface at the Channel exit. The slope of the bubble enhanced
ingestion boundary is common to all ﬁxed frequency maps.

6.2 Fixed Bubble Volume (L : 48 mm)

Each of the regime maps of Figs. 21-28 hold bubble frequency f constant and vary

Vb and 62;. In Figs. 29 and 30 two maps are presented Where Vb is ﬁxed and f

m1 off the minimum separation bubble volume of mem = 0.20 ml. These maps
are signiﬁcantly different in Character from the ﬁxed frequency maps. For these
tests 10W Q9 values imply 10W f . In Fig. 29 at low Q9, single bubble separations are
observed despite Vb < mein due to the capillary overshoot mechanism. Interestingly,
these rarely complete separations do not appear to impact the ingestion limit, Which
steadily increases With increasing Q9 at a common slope provided Vb ,3 14mm. The
overshoot-Coalescence phenomena ends With increases in Q; and Q9.

In Fig. 30, since Vb > 14mm, the 100% separation condition for singles and
mergers is the norm, though an island of mixed partial separation behaviour is
evident. Though Figs. 29 and 30 represent the only true ﬁxed bubble volume maps
completed, binning bubble volume data Within :|:0.0125 m1 of select values, the
regime map transitions can be observed from Fig. 313. for the data and regime
map boundaries and from Fig. 31b for the regime boundaries and shaded regimes.
Inspection of Fig. 31 identiﬁes how various regimes grow and decay With 14,.

6.3 Fixed Bubble Frequency, Variable Channel Length (L : 15, 25, 48
mm)
The length of the Channel plays a critical role in the ability of such conduits to
separate bubbles. Shorter Channels allow less time for bubbles Vb > mem to reach
the free surface. They also support signiﬁcantly higher base ﬂow ingestion limits
le9 further reducing the time available for cross ﬂow bubble migration, free surface

coalescence, and separation. For a ﬁxed frequency of f = 1.25 HZ, Figs. 32 and 33
present maps for free surface lengths L = 15 and 25 mm, respectively. The case
of f = 1.25 HZ With L = 48 mm was presented in Fig. 25. The liquid ﬂow rate
at ingestion leg varies With L and empirically determined values are identiﬁed
in the ﬁgures along With ngm (of. Fig. 37). The 100% separation condition is
achieved only in the case of mergers at low Q; for the conditions established in these
tests. Signiﬁcantly higher Q9 values would be required for 100% for single bubbles
to coalesce and exit. Particularly in Fig. 32, the shorter Channel does not permit
sufﬁcient time for coalescence to occur. The shorter stiffer free surface also promotes
the bouncing of larger bubbles, preventing coalescence Within the free surface length
L.
7 Examples of Data Reduction Directions
Various aspects of the general phenomena may be studied in greater depth using
the Video archive. Though efforts are continuing, we brieﬂy address a few such
topics here: merger transients and limits, bubble exit locations, and free surface
wave dynamics.
7.1 Merge Transients and Approximate Limit Analysis
The large dataset is replete With bubble merger events of Which only a subset Will
be touched on here. For example, a selection of 0% separation mergers are shown

in Fig. 34 With speciﬁc conditions listed. These are cases of pure Channel eXit
mergers 34a, alternating bubble mergers 34b, pure Channel entrance mergers 34C,
and mixed mid-Channel intermediate bubble volume mergers 34d. Other merger
patterns are observed that could be deﬁned to further subdivide the merger regime
domains. For example, With generally increasing Q9 and Q; we observe multi-
mergers, several entrance merger types, pure mergers, harmonic mergers, sparse
hydrodynamic mergers, and 100% singles With occasional mergers due to rebounds
off the free surface. We restrict our attention here only to mergers resulting from
over—packing bubble trains as typiﬁed in Fig. 34.

Merge dynamics are readily measured by digitizing the elevation of the top of
the merged bubble $bt(t) for any merge event. This is accomplished in Fig. 35 for
various 0% mergers varying Vb holding Q; ﬁxed, and holding Vb ﬁxed While varying
62;. A cursory inspection of the ﬁgure reveals that for this selection of conditions
the migration velocity is nearly independent of Vb and 62;, and that the initially
slightly conﬁned single bubbles are capable of only slightly overshooting their ideal
merged bubble inscribed elevations £13m, as was also demonstrated in the drop tower
experiments in Fig. 3C-d. Note in this ﬁgure that for spherical bubbles mm = 51:19 +Rb,
or mm = Rb(1—|—sirioz)/ sin oz. From Fig. 35 the common migration rate of the merged
bubbles is z 6.4 :I: 0.4 mm/s, Which is signiﬁcantly less than the common single
bubble migration rate of m 37.5 :I: 1.5 mm/s from Fig. 5.

We note that for ideally inscribed single and merged bubbles, the merged bub-

6.60 (0.115 radians) and is independent of 14,. For wedge sections Where oz < 6.60,
the merged bubbles may be expected to re-rnerge With other single bubbles at least
once, Whereas if oz > 6.60, the merged bubble Will move to an elevation that Will
not permit further interaction With other un—merged single bubbles. This conclusion
emerges from the present study Where oz 2 7.90, as observed in Fig. 34a and d, Where
the inertial capillary overshoot also works in favor of no re-merges. (The pure merger
case of Fig. 340 has no Chance to re-rnerge since all single bubbles merge.) However,
re-mergers do occur as shown in Fig. 34b, suggesting that local hydrodynamics often
trumps the simple inscribed bubble packing arguments presented here. Further
details of re-mergers must be reported on a separate occasion.

Mergers are obviously increasingly likely With increasing bubble density. As the
distance between bubbles decreases, any number of second order mechanisms can
trigger the merge phenomena. A partial list of observed mechanisms includes: (1)
variations in bubble volume and / or elevation, (2) pulsatile disturbances to the ﬂow
and free surface induced by subsequent bubble injections, (3) forward stagnation

ahead to merge With their predecessors, (4) entrainment of bubbles in adjacent
bubble wakes, (5) unique ﬂow harmonics, and (6) a Channel exit contraction effect
that can trip the merge phenomena from its densest bubble train condition, setting
off a sequence of mergers that propagate upstream to the Channel entrance Where the
bubble train is then gradually reestablished and the process repeated. Concerning
variations in bubble volume, assuming that the bubbles take inscribed elevations,
one might argue that any variation in Vb Will ultimately lead to mergers, since larger
bubbles move along slightly higher elevations Where the base ﬂow is faster enabling
them to catch up and merge With any slightly smaller bubbles. Long Channel lengths
are likely to reveal additional details and an increased variety of merger phenomena.
But the length of open capillary Channels is limited by le9. Such studies might
best be conducted using Closed Channels as demonstrated in Fig. 34a.

Simple merge limit predictions are possible With knowledge of the critical bubble
spacing 6b and the base ﬂow velocity proﬁle wb(:I:b), both of Which are sketched in
Fig. 34a for a train of bubbles With conditions speciﬁed. At steady state, the time

As suggested by bubble velocity plots such as Fig. 16 and from previous observations
by [12], the developing velocity proﬁle sketched in Fig. 34a consists of a parabolic
boundary layer region near the vertex, a lengthy intermediate linear region poten-
tially also in the boundary layer, and a plug ﬂOW-like free stream region near the
free surface. The extent of each region depends primarily on the value 0f 62;, the
z-location, and free surface length L.

demonstrated shortly in §8.
7.2 Bubble Exit length
Knowledge of the distance the bubble travels down the Channel before coalescing
With the free surface z = [H is an important metric for such ﬂows since it permits one
to determine the desired Channel length to achieve a desired result. Data is recorded
for the average value of leeas for 10 bubbles for 100% separation conditions. Only
a single example is provided in Fig. 36 for ﬁxed frequency f = 0.75 HZ and for the
variety of bubble volumes speciﬁed. For inertial—capillary bubble migration (Sagr E

is found to approximate the linear trends observed, Where the ﬁt coefﬁcient for
f = 0.75 HZ is 3.66 :I: 0.32. [12] found Cf % 10.5 for f = 0.2 HZ. The strong
dependence of Cf on f is indicative of the sensitivity of coalescence to the various
oscillations of the system. A Wide variety of outcomes due to bubble frequency
effects, harmonics, bouncing, bimodal behaviour (Where two [H values arise for one
test condition), and other free surface interactions are readily observed in the data
archive but Will not be discussed further herein. For Ql 3 0.7leg, the value of [H
from eq. 28 serves as a reasonable prediction of the minimum Channel length required
to separate bubbles Z, Vimm. At higher values of Q; eq. 28 becomes increasingly
conservative as the free surface is deﬂected increasing inward enhancing bubble
coalescence. We also observe that for short Channels, When the 1-D free surface

curvature condition (H 04 / L)2 << 1 is not satisﬁed, the increased ‘stiffness’ of the free
surface leads to signiﬁcant rebounds that deny single bubbles a second opportunity
to coalesce With the free surface before being swept through the Channel exit. In
such cases eq. 28 is inadequate.
7.3 Free Surface Wave Dynamics
Bubbles that coalesce at the free surface generate capillary waves With wavelength
and speed tied to the bubble diameter and liquid ﬂow rate 62;. As expected, the
smaller the bubble the faster the wave according to the well-known capillary wave

for Q; = 1.86 ml/s in Fig. 16 With an open slider show elevated velocities indicative
of mpg in the range of 20 mm/s.

The capillary waves propagate downstream at speeds equal to the capillary wave
speed plus the free surface velocity—highs 0f 80 mm/s are observed for Q; = 1.86
ml/s. Reﬂected waves return at speeds equal to the same capillary wave speed
minus the free surface velocity—ﬂows 0f 40 mm/s are observed from the data for

Where wwave % wcwavemm :I: zaps = 66 :I: 15 mm/s Which compares well to terse
observations of the data Where 60 :I: 20 mm/s. This approximate approach may be
extended quickly to predict the time required for the wave produced by a bubble—free
surface coalescence at z = [H to travel downstream a distance L — lH, reﬂect, and
return to location z = [H (ref. eq. 28). The time for this process is given by

frequency f7. 2 75,71 x 0.93 HZ. This frequency for this ﬂow rate is surprisingly Close
to the conditions identiﬁed by [12] (Fig. 150 in that article), Where coalescence With
the free surface could not be achieved at f = 1 HZ and Q; = 1.91 ml/s. The present
arguments support the Claim that the natural frequency of the reﬂected waves match
the bubble injection frequency f , providing a timely bounce t0 the free surface that
prevents coalescence.

By such mechanisms the free surface waves can have local impact on coalescence
and can set up harmonics Within the system that retard or enhance bubble mergers
and/or bubble coalescence. In general, however, the free surface waves serve as
perturbations to the bubble paths and not as a primary mover, as can be gleaned
from Figs. 15, 16, and 18, Where bubble paths appear similar Whether a free surface
is present 01' not. Room is not afforded here to elaborate on such waves but their
presence and impact is noted and may be pursued more quantitatively from the
Video archive.

8 Heuristic Regime Map

As guided by observations of the regime maps, simple heuristic models may be
applied to predict the various regime boundaries observed and, as an example,
we demonstrate approximate map construction for the ﬁxed frequency case; i.e.,
Figs. 21-28. For our example, we Will ‘re—construct’ the f = 1.25 HZ map of Fig. 24
piecemeal by introducing each regime limit mechanism. Comparisons are then made
to all experimental maps. We View this as a preliminary effort With anticipated im-
provements and generalizations following further analysis of the data and 0f subse—
quent third party theoretical and numerical work. In the meantime such capabilities
are immediately of value for design.

reported in detail elsewhere by [21] and [25]. The ingestion limit experimental data

presented in Fig. 7g. In general, leg is computed by solving an approximate 1-D

8.3 Inertial Capillary Overshoot Limit, Q3500
From observations of Figs 4, 14, and 15, due to the inertial—capillary bubble migra-
tion, bubbles can at times be propelled approximately 25% further than their ideal
inscribed elevations. As a consequence, occasional partial single bubble separations
are possible both below and above ngm. The transition from 0% to 100% single
bubble separations is therefore blurred and a region

does well to bracket the majority of outcomes, Where the subscript ico refers to
‘inertial—capillary overshoot.’ TWO vertical lines identify 62351.60 in Fig. 38.
8.4 Merge Limits
As brieﬂy summarized in §7.1, small single bubbles Within the boundary layer vertex
region of the ﬂow begin to merge below the liquid ﬂow rate le1 predicted by eq. 24
With m = 0.60. If the single bubble volume Vb f, mem/2, the merged bubble volume
Will remain below mein and be unable to reach the free surface. However, if the
single bubble volume Vb Z mem/2, the merged bubble volume Will be 2 mem and
such bubbles are capable of coalescing With the free surface. Thus, eq. 24 is plotted
in Fig. 38 only up to the point it intersects With the vertical boundary associated
With ngm / 2. This segment of eq. 24 is a vertex region merge limit Where small
single bubble mergers produce 0% separating mergers.

For larger bubbles that inscribe further away from the vertex, it was shown in
Fig. 16 that the forced “bubble velocity proﬁle’ is effectively linear. As developed
in §7.1 for this situation, inscribed bubbles begin to merge for liquid ﬂow rates
below le2 from eq. 27 With n = 3 / 2. Partial separations of single and merged
bubbles Within the 623260 band are expected With 100% merger separations expected
for Q9 2, QECO. Thus, eq. 27 is plotted in Fig. 38 beginning from the point it
intersects With the leftmost vertical boundary associated With Qg—ico' This segment
of eq. 27 represents a linear boundary layer ﬂow region merge limit below Which
intermediate—to—large single bubble mergers are observed along With single bubble
separations yielding What we deﬁne as partial and 100% separating mergers. As Q9
increases the percent of merging bubbles that coalesce With the free surface decreases
compared to that of single bubbles that coalesce.

establishes 0.81 :I: 0.07, Which is presented in eq. 37. With knowledge of leg from
eq. 32, Qlcei is computed from eq. 37 and plotted on Fig. 38 for Q9 > ng.
8.6 The ‘Hook’ and the Bubble Enhanced Stability Regime
As described in §6, the QECO vertical boundary possesses a leftward hook as it
nears the leg limit. This hook approximately intersects With leg and ng,
Where it apparently triggers the end of the bubble enhanced stability regime (bes).
Interestingly, Within this regime the maximum value for Q; E le68 > leg is
correlated by
lees : Qling + 0-81an (38)
With an uncertainty in the slope of less than :|:2%. This value agrees With that of
Qlcei in eq. 37, but With opposite sign. Therefore the collapse of the bubble enhanced
stability region decreases the liquid ﬂow rate by AQ; % 20.8162ch Eq. 38 is plotted
and the hook is sketched in Fig. 38.
8.7 Analytical Map Comparisons and the Partial Merger Island
The merger regimes are complicated for Q; values below the testable limits of the
CCF hardware. The boundaries between 0% and partial mergers and partial and
100% mergers might be expected to emanate from the origin, the former intersecting
With the terminus of the vertex region merge limit le1 and the latter intersecting
With QECO and free stream merge limit le2. Connecting the terminus of lel
and the intersection of ng With leg Closes off the partial merger regime com-
pleting the map for practical purposes. The relationships for these boundaries are
represented here by the following:

Fig. 39. The agreement is encouraging if not adequate. The best results are observed
for leg, le68, and Qlcei, but taken together they allow one to quickly estimate
expected performance for expected values of Q9 and 62;. The worst result is the lack
of prediction of the partial merges observed Clustered near the bottom of the 623260
regime as identiﬁed by the red dashed oval in Fig. 38 and data of Fig. 39. After
a closer look, these mergers occur for sparse bubbles Where 6;, Z, 21%, well below
the packing limits of §7.1 and are enabled by strong hydrodynamic interactions
between bubble pairs. This additional Class of sparse hydrodynamic mergers is

"
"59","Clearly identiﬁed by the fact that they do not conform to simple packing arguments.
Observations point to bubble wake vertex interaction and entrainment complicated
by a growing base ﬂow boundary layer. Further investigation of such mechanisms
is postponed for the time being.

From the §8 arguments, for similar systems (N 571+) one is able to establish
speciﬁc geometric dimensions, gas and liquid ﬂow rates, and even margins of safety
to prevent or ensure passive bubble separation in the open wedge conduit. For
processes such as boiling, one must establish means to assess Vb distributions. But
even a light inspection of the present results Will greatly speed such efforts. These
results compliment, but also signiﬁcantly extend, the quantitative results of [12].
10 Conclusions
These CCF space experiments aboard the ISS employ an unusually large buoyancy-
free 2-phase ﬂow of bubbles driven along an open wedge Channel. The experimental
apparatus is conﬁgured to study the passive phase separating Characteristics of the
geometry providing a large database for further fundamental and applied investiga-
tions of the inertial capillary phenomena. The problem is of particular relevance to
ﬂuids management aboard spacecraft, but is also relevant for fast ﬂows of low Vis-
cosity liquids in terrestrial applications. The space experiments conducted record
thousands of events during 40 days of continuous commanding from ground sta-
tions and the ~ O(lTB) Video archive is made publicly available on the internet for
broader dissemination.

Enough important Characteristics of the ﬂow are gathered from inspection of the
data combined With heuristic scaling arguments to provide a fair reconstruction of
the ﬂow regimes arising in such systems. Based on the importance of the inscribed
bubble elevation, these include a priori design guides predicting minimum bubble
volumes required to separate, or merge and separate, Within the length of Channel
speciﬁed. The regime map is bounded above by a gas ingestion limit in a bubble
enhanced stability region at low gas ﬂow rate and a bubble—free surface coalescence
enhanced ingestion region at moderate to high gas ﬂow rates. Theoretical and
numerical analyses can draw from the data set to investigate a variety of interesting
aspects of the ﬂow; such as the further division of the merger regimes (multi—mergers,
entrance mergers, harmonics, etc.), merger hydrodynamics, the often retarding or
enhancing effect of free surface waves on coalescence, the coupled hydrodynamics of
the inertial cross-ﬂow capillary migration With the inertial developing base ﬂow, and
the Changes in bubble behaviour above and below the growing boundary layer Within
the ﬂow—in particular, the long-time elevation of bubbles driven below or beyond
their inscribed elevations due to the developing shear ﬂow in the asymmetric Channel.
Such behaviours Within fully-developed ﬂows would be a practical ﬁrst step. Further
data reduction efforts are ongoing that include signiﬁcant drop tower experimental
results and numerical analysis. The CCF experiment hardware resides on the ISS
and experiments are resumed in August 2014 and Will be reported separately.

CCF EU2-02 Video Archive

The Video archive for the 2nd (02) run of the Capillary Channel Flow (CCF)
wedge Experiment Unit (EU2) is publicly available at http://psi.nasa.g0v requiring
only a request for access. It is referred to as CCF-EU2-02. The approximately 880
GB database contains the Video results of over 5000 set points varying 14,, f , 62;,
and L. The ﬁles may be downloaded on a case by case basis 01' in total. The data is
largely provided and referenced from a single Microsoft Excel spreadsheet With all
critical experiment conditions listed and With each associated Video hyper-linked.
Fig. A40 provides an image of the spreadsheet that conveys the general format. The
Excel ﬁle employs a variety of macros to sort the data and the most populated maps
of Figs. 21-27 (ﬁxed f), Figs. 29 and 30 (ﬁxed W), and Figs. 32 and 33 (ﬁxed L) are
provided Where one may select any data point in the plots to pull up the associated
Video. This ‘hyper—linking’ considerably facilitates the understanding of the general
regime behaviour and is an enjoyable way to peruse the data.

For subsequent quantitative data reduction Via image analysis, each Video ﬁle
must be rectiﬁed to correct for camera skew. Instruction and batch ﬁles are available
in the archive to perform this operation. For indices of refraction N unartz = 1.458
for the test Channel and NDHFE = 1.29 for the test liquid, for the wedge of 04 = 7.90
one determines that refraction effects are S, 0.3% and may effectively be ignored if
desired. Further instructions regarding the CCF-EU2-02 database are provided at
http://psi.nasa.g0v.
