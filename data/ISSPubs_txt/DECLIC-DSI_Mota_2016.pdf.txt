Abstract

In situ monitoring of directional solidiﬁcation experiments on a transparent model alloy
was carried out under low gravity in the Directional Solidification Insert 0f the Device for the
Study of Critical Liquids and Crystallization (DECLIC—DSD on-board the International Space
Station. The present work is focused on the analysis of the interface recoil and its macroscopic
shape evolution. Theoretically the interface movement is due to the formation of a solute
boundary layer in front of the interface. However, the bulk conﬁguration and the thermal
speciﬁcities of transparent systems induce thermal effects, which are usually not observed in the
classical thin sample configuration. Numerical thermal modeling highlights two thermal
contributions to the interface recoil, both increasing with pulling rate. The Warren and Langer
model is modiﬁed to take into account these contributions that modify the interface dynamics,
and a good agreement is obtained between the experiments and the modiﬁed model.

Introduction
In order to design and process new materials, the study of solidification microstructures
formation is crucial, as the interface patterns formed by solidiﬁcation largely govern its
mechanical and physical properties. One of the main techniques used to precisely study the
fundamean aspects is the directional solidiﬁcation, where the vertical Bridgman method is one
of the most widely used since it has the advantage of steady temperature fields and a controllable
temperature gradient.
The wide use of transparent organic analogs that behave like metallic alloys regarding
solidification is related to their transparency to Visible light, so that in situ and real time
observation of the interface can be done by classical optical techniques [1, 2]. Many experiments
on transparent systems have been conducted in thin samples [3-6], which led to signiﬁcant
progress in understanding the dynamics of solidification. However, these conﬁgurations are not
representative of three-dimensional (3D) samples and quantitative data extracted from thin
samples cannot be extrapolated to 3D conﬁguration. Bulk experiments are therefore required and
essential. However, in 3D samples there is a complex coupling between ﬂuid ﬂow and
morphological instability: ground—based studies, in both metallic and organic alloys, clearly
23

"
"4","showed that the ﬂuid convection on Earth modifies the structure of the solute boundary layer,
causing non-uniform morphological instability along the interface [7, 8]. Fluid ﬂow elimination
in 3D samples requires the reduced gravity environment of space.
The present study was conducted on board the International Space Station (ISS) in the
framework of the French Space Agency (Centre National d’etudes Spatiales, CNES) project
MISOL3D (Microstructures de Solidiﬁcation 3D) and National Aeronautics and Space
Administration (NASA) project DSIP (Dynamical Selection of 3D Interface Patterns).
Experiments were realized using the directional solidiﬁcation insert (DSD 0f the Device for the
study of Critical Liquids and Crystallization (DECLIC) developed by CNES, which is dedicated
to in situ and real time characterization of the dynamical selection of the solid-liquid interface
morphology on bulk samples of transparent materials [9-11].
A transient period is always present as the ﬁrst stage of the evolution of the solid-liquid interface
from rest to a steady state characterized by a growth velocity equal to the applied pulling rate.
Theoretical models assume that, at rest, initially the smooth interface is located on the liquidus
isotherm, at a ﬁxed position determined by the thermal proﬁle in the adiabatic area. The motion
from the initial interface position (liquidus isotherm) to its steady state one (solidus isotherm in
case of planar front growth) is called front recoil, the duration of which also deﬁnes the initial
transient [12, 13]. One important point to note is that the growth microstructure usually develops
during the initial solidification transient. Analyzing the dynamics of this initial transient is thus
critical for the understanding of the ﬁnal steady state microstructure. In this work, experiments
will be analyzed in terms of their solidification front recoil.

Experimental procedure
The DECLIC—DSI mainly contains two elements: the Bridgman furnace and the experimental
cartridge. Complete description of the device and its inserts may be found elsewhere [10, 11].
The experimental cartridge includes a quartz crucible and a system of volume compensation. The
cylindrical crucible has an inner diameter of 10 mm and a length that allows ~10 cm of
solidification. In this study, we used a succinonitrile (SCN) — 0.24wt% camphor alloy. In order
to ﬁll the crucible, SCN puriﬁed by NASA by both distillation and zone melting was used. The
alloy was then prepared by adding the solute. All procedures for sample preparation were
carefully realized under vacuum to avoid humidity contamination. Once sealed, the cartridge was
inserted inside the Bridgman furnace. The thermal gradient G is imposed by regulating hot and
cold zones, located above and below the adiabatic area where the interface is positioned. After
the thermal regulation, partial melting is performed (a solid seed of ~20mm is always kept to
preserve the oriented single crystal) and the sample is then homogenized for at least 24h before
performing solidification. Directional solidiﬁcation is carried out by pulling the crucible into the
cold zone at a constant rate for a length of 60 mm. Experiments with pulling rates Vp ranging
from 0.5 to 8 m/s and G=12K/cn1 will be considered in this work.
The crucible is equipped with a ﬂat glass window at the bottom and an immersed lens at the top.
The axial observation is the main observation mode and it takes advantage from the complete
axial transparency of the cartridge. This observation mode is used to study the pattern dynamics
and characteristics. However in this work the results were obtained from the side View
observation, which allows imaging the interface motion as well as its macroscopic shape.

The interface recoil was investigated by measuring the motion of the interface in the adiabatic
area using the transverse observation. Fig.1(a) shows a step-by-step evolution of the whole
experiment starting from rest for 4 m/s (G=12K/cm) and Fig.1(b) shows the interface position
as a function of the solidiﬁed length L (namely the pulled length : L = Vp t, with t: solidiﬁcation
time) for a set of different pulling rates and a fixed thermal gradient.

The build—up of a solute boundary layer ahead of the interface during growth leads to a change of

mL=-1.365K/wt%; C0=0.24wt%; partition coefficient k=0.138 at the solidus). For G=12chm,
this displacement is 1.71mm and is independent of the pulling rate. In all experiments treated, the
pulling rate is higher than the critical velocity VC corresponding to the transition from planar
front growth to cellular growth so that a microstructure develops. The cells or dendrites tips grow
in the undercooled area towards the liquidus isotherm. Measurements were performed as much
as possible at the tips level, as the solidus position is unknown. At steady state, tips are located at
a distance tof the solidus estimated by the Bower, Brody and Flemings (BBP) expression [14]:

where BL is the solute diffusion coefﬁcient in the liquid (270 mZ/s). Theoretically, the higher
the pulling rate, the closer the tips will be from the liquidus, and the lower the front recoil will
be. However, as can be seen in Fig.1(b), the experimental front recoil increases with pulling rate.
This disagreement comes from the theoretical assumption of a frozen thermal ﬁeld, meaning that
the thermal ﬁeld is neither shifted nor disturbed by pulling. The tip advance as well as the
experimental recoil values can be found elsewhere [15].
To analyze the thermal ﬁeld in the furnace and the interface recoil induced by pulling, the
software packages CrysVUn® and CrysMAS® which are designed for the global modeling of
solidification processes in complex furnaces with axial 0r translational symmetry are used.
Calculations are based on a method of ﬁnite volumes on unstructured grids that enables tackling
the entire growth setup on the basis of a geometrical model of the furnace, crucible and sample.
It is worth noticing that in these purely thermal simulations, the microstructure is not taken into
account: interface recoil therefore corresponds to the motion from the liquidus isotherm t0 the
solidus one, as in a planar front growth. To analyze the different contributions to recoil,
additional simulations are performed ﬁxing the latent heat of fusion AH to zero. An example of
the results for G=12chm and Vp=4 m/s is given in Fig.2 (a).

Three different contributions to the recoil are therefore highlighted:

- Instrumental recoil: isotherm shift due to the thermal exchanges induced by pulling
deduced from the comparison between liquidus isotherm positions at rest and during
pulling with AH=0;

26

"
"7","- Solutal recoil: corresponds to the interface temperature change from the liquidus t0
solidus (AH=0);

- Latent heat recoil: isotherm shift due to latent heat release measured from the comparison
between solidus isotherms positions during pulling for AH=0 and the normal value of AH
(3.7kJ/mol).

CrysMAS was then used to determine the sensitivity of the different contributions to recoil t0
pulling rate (Fig.2(b)). Numerically, the solutal contribution to recoil is roughly insensitive to
pulling rate, whereas instrumental and latent heat contributions increase linearly with pulling
rate. The total numerical and experimental recoils display the same variation with pulling rate,
thus explaining the relative positions of the interface for different pulling rates (Fig.1(b)).
Warren and Langer (WL) [13] developed an approach to describe the acceleration of the
interface and the simultaneous build-up of the solutal boundary layer during the initial transient
based on the assumption of an exponential transient concentration proﬁle in the liquid, similar to
the one obtained in the steady state but with some time-dependent solutal length and solute
concentration at the interface. As a result, their model predicts the instantaneous solutal length,
interface velocity, solute concentration at the interface and interface position. One assumption
behind this model is that the thermal field is frozen so that the recoil is only of solutal origin. We
have previously demonstrated that we are not in such a configuration. Thus, the WL model
cannot be directly used but it has to be modiﬁed to include the thermal effects previously
identified. Numerical studies to evaluate the transient interface velocity for purely thermal
effects after a velocity jump in a Bridgman furnace [16, 17] concluded that the interface position
asymptotically approach its steady state position with a time dependent thermal shift AZT [1 -
€Xp(-t/T)], where t is the time, AZT is the total isotherm shift at the steady state resulting from
both latent heat release and instrumental recoil, and T is a delay time dependent of the physical
parameters of the alloy, the geometry of the furnace and crucible, the thermal gradient and the
pulling rate.
Warren and Langer (WL) [13] formulated the problem in terms of two time-dependent variables:
the solute boundary layer thickness 1 and the interface position 20 in a reference frame that is
moving with a constant velocity Vp, whose origin is taken at the isotherm corresponding to the
melting point of the pure solvent (SCN, Tm=58.08°C). A modified WL model was then
developed which includes thermal drift by writing the temperature ﬁeld in a frame translating at
velocity Vp in the form:
T(z) = Tm + 62 + GAZT (1 — e‘t/T)
The interface equilibrium condition is then given by:
Tm _ T(ZO) G _t
C0 —|TL|— —|m—L|[ZO+AZT(1—€/T)]
where 20 is the position of the solid-liquid interface in the moving frame and C0 is the solute
concentration 011 the liquid side of the interface. The dynamical equations of the modiﬁed WL
model including the thermal drift are the same as the original ones used jointly with the modiﬁed
interface equilibrium condition:

where l is the instantaneous boundary layer thickness, Coo is the ﬁxed nominal concentration of
the alloy that is not affected by the thermal drift, Zoo is the initial position of the interface at rest
(200 = — % C00), and i and 20 denote ﬁrst order time derivatives.
We applied this modified model to analyze our results, treating T as an adjustable parameter. AZT
was used as input into the model for each pulling rate and it was deduced from experiments
taking into account the theoretical solutal recoil and the tip advance. The best fit results are
presented in Fig.3. The predictions result from a least squares ﬁt with ragainst the experimental
data at early time (LSme) while the solid-liquid interface is still planar before morphological
destabilization.

Conclusion
This work was realized in the framework of the DECLIC—DSI project, dedicated to in situ and
real time observation of the solid-liquid interface during directional solidiﬁcation of bulk
transparent alloys. DECLIC was installed on board the 188, under microgravity, thus avoiding
ﬂuid ﬂow inﬂuence. Even if the main observation mode of this device is the axial observation,
the data presented here come from the side View observation, which enables the study of the
interface motion during the whole experiment. The experiments analyzed have been carried out
011 a transparent organic alloy (succinonitrile-O.24wt% camphor).
Thermal analyses were performed revealing two contributions to interface motion during pulling.
These contributions add to the standard physical recoil that corresponds to the interface
temperature change from the liquidus t0 the solidus. These contributions justify the qualiﬁcation
of a not frozen thermal ﬁeld, and they increase linearly with pulling rate.
Experimentally, the evolution of the interface position as a function of the solidiﬁcation length
was measured for different pulling rates. The global interface recoil increase with pulling rate is
compatible with a not frozen thermal ﬁeld condition. The WL model was modiﬁed to take into
account the isotherm shift contribution and a good agreement was obtained between experiments
and the modiﬁed model.
The present work gave a better understanding of the general front behavior for geometrical
conﬁgurations not associated to a frozen thermal ﬁeld, and it clearly appeared that the thermal
transients have to be taken into account for a complete understanding of front dynamics for such
bulk samples.
