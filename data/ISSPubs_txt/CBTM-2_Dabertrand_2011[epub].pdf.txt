"2","16 Abstract
17 Gravity has a structural role for living systems. Tissue development, architecture and
18 organization are modiﬁed when the gravity vector is changed. In particular, microgravity
19 induces a redistribution of blood volume and thus pressure in the astronaut body, abolishing
20 an upright blood pressure gradient inducing orthostatic hypotension. The present study was
21 designed to investigate whether isolated vascular smooth muscle cells are directly sensitive to
22 altered gravitational forces and, secondly, whether sustained blood pressure changes act on
23 the same molecular target. Exposure to microgravity during 8 days in International Space
24 Station induced the decrease of ryanodine receptor subtype 1 expression in primary cultured
25 myocytes from rat hepatic portal vein. Identical results were found in portal vein from mice
26 exposed to microgravity during an 8 days Shuttle spaceﬂight. To evaluate the functional
27 consequences of this physiological adaptation, we have compared evoked calcium signals
28 obtained in myocytes from hindlimb unloaded rats, in which the shift of blood pressure
29 mimics the one produced by the microgravity, to those obtained in myocytes from rats
30 injected with antisense oligonucleotide directed against ryanodine receptor subtype 1. In both
31 conditions, calcium signals implicating calcium-induced calcium release were signiﬁcantly
32 decreased. In contrary, in spontaneous hypertensive rat, an increase in ryanodine receptor
33 subtype 1 expression was observed as well as the calcium-induced calcium release
34 mechanism. Taken together, our results shown that myocytes were directly sensitive to
35 gravity level and they adapt their calcium signaling pathways to pressure by the regulation of
36 the ryanodine receptor subtype 1 expression.

"3","41 Introduction
42 During spaceﬂight, the microgravity (HG) induces blood volume redistribution and
43 concomitant modiﬁcation of the upright blood pressure gradient, in the astronaut body, from
44 70 mmHg in the head and 200 mmHg in the lowest resistance arteries to a constant pressure
45 near 100 mmHg in the Whole body (23). Thus a decrease in blood pressure below the heart
46 seems to be one of the ﬁrst consequences of HG, Which can precede and trigger the adaptation
47 0f the vascular system (56). Many factors known to regulate blood pressure likely coexist in
48 the vascular adaptation to HG: (I) the control of ﬂuid volume and associated decrease in
49 plasma volume (45), (II) the cardiac hypofunction and the alteration of baro- and
50 cardiopulmonary reﬂexes (24) and (III) the adaptation of vascular responses at endothelial
51 and vascular smooth muscle cell (VSMC) levels. Indeed simulated HG, using the hindlimb
52 unloaded (HU) rat model, can modify the vascular reactivity in infero-posterior vessels like
53 abdominal aorta, mesenteric, femoral arteries and portal vein (8,20,40,47).
54 In the animal model of hypertension, a dysregulation of vasoreactiVity encoded by
55 Ca2+ signals has been reported. Indeed, the contraction induced by depolarization is greater in
56 spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR) than in control rats and a change in Ca2+ signaling
57 pathways implicating intracellular Ca2+ stores has been evidenced (1 ,29,30). More recently, a
58 global adaptation of Ca2+ signaling pathways was suggested in this hypertensive model (51).
59 The vascular adaptation to changes in blood pressure is due to smooth muscle
60 contractile activity and its regulation by endothelium, hormones and neurotransmitters (13).
61 In fact, the myogenic response can be considered as the equilibrium between contraction and
62 relaxation pathways. Both pathways involve Ca2+ signaling. In vascular smooth muscle cells
63 (VSMC), ryanodine receptors (RyRs) are reticulum Ca2+ channels likely implicated in both
64 relaxation and contraction processes (5). Indeed, RyRs can be activated Via the Ca2+-induced
65 Ca2+ mechanism (CICR) that ampliﬁes InsP3R and Ca2+ entry primary signals and thus

3

"
"4","66 participate to the cytoplasmic Ca2+ increase that can trigger contraction (22,27). However,
67 RyRs produce localized Ca2+ events (Ca2+ sparks), which activate Ca2+-activated K4r currents
68 leading to membrane hyperpolarization and thus relaxation through inhibition of L-type
69 channels (28). Three RyR genes have been described and, although their expression pattern in
70 VSMC varies between species and studies, the common expression of the three subtypes
71 (RyR1-3) has been reported in rat aorta, superior and small mesenteric arteries and hepatic
72 portal vein (9,44). Each RyR subtype had a speciﬁc function in Ca2+ signals. In smooth
73 muscle it has been shown that both Rle and RyR2 are able to generate Ca2+ sparks and
74 Ca2+ waves (9). RyR expression is modulated in physiopathological conditions like muscular
75 dystrophy and after blood redistribution following a chronic position change as hindlimb
76 unloading (8,10,39,40).
77 We designed the present study to investigate the effect of real HG 0n RyR expression
78 in portal veins from mice and on rat primary cultured VSMC exposed to HG. To evaluate the
79 functional effect of HG exposure, we have measured Ca2+ signals observed in HU rat model.
80 Secondly, we have evaluated if the regulation observed in HU (hypotension model) could be
81 the opposite of those observed in SHR (hypertension model). In portal vein, the expression
82 pattern of Rle was decreased by exposure to HG in both cultured VSMC and mouse portal
83 vein as well as in portal vein from HU rat. We mimicked altered Ca2+ signals measured in
84 portal vein from HU rats by in vivo injections of antisense oligonucleotide directed against
85 Rle. Finally, the increased pressure observed in SHR induced the opposite effect: the
86 increase of Rle expression and the increase of Ca2+-induced Ca2+ release (CICR). Taken
87 together, these ﬁndings suggest that VSMC adapt themselves to the forces that they
88 experience, gravitational as hemodynamic, by modulating their expression of Rle.

"5","91 Methods

92 Animals - These investigations conform to the European Community and French

93 guiding principles for the care and use of animals. Authorization to perform animal

94 experiments (A-33-063-003) was obtained from the Prefecture de la Gironde (France). Wistar

95 male rats as well as spontaneous hypertensive rats (SHR) and their control Wistar Kyoto rats

96 (WKR) (120-150g) were euthanized by cervical dislocation.

97 Hindlimb unloading mt - Brieﬂy, rats were hindlimb unloaded (HU, 8 days, angle

98 30-400) by tail attachment as described previously (40) and in accordance with

99 recommendations published by the National Aeronautic and Space Agency (NASA) (42). The
100 hindlimb unloading time was chosen because (1) it was compatible to HG exposure during
101 space ﬂight missions (Soyuz TMA-8 transport mission and STS-118) and (2) we have
102 previously shown that portal vein adaptation was signiﬁcant after this HU duration. If there is
103 no modiﬁcation of the body weight, the HU effects calibrated 0n soleus wet weight are
104 signiﬁcant (52). Here soleus wet weight from HU rats was 20% decreased in comparison
105 with control rats. Moreover, vascular effects of HG such as orthostatic disorders can appear
106 after only a few days of HG exposure (55).
107 Mice in STS118 — European Space Agency (ESA) gave us the opportunity to retrieve
108 hepatic portal vein from mice that were exposed to HG during the STS-118 mission. The
109 C57B16/J breeding was assumed by the NASA. Animals were separated in 3 groups (N = 6
110 mice per group): conditioned in classical breeding environment (Baseline, BL); in cage used
111 for the ﬂight and stayed on Earth (ground control, GC) and boarded 0n STS-118 (Fly). Portal
112 veins were removed, stored in 4% PFA for immunolabelling and RNA later solution (Qiagen)
113 for RT-qPCR and shipped to our laboratory for analysis.
114 Culture of VSM C from hepatic portal vein - The dissociation of portal vein VSMC
115 was detailed previously (41). Brieﬂy, tissues were incubated twice in a cocktail of 0.8 mg/ml

5

"6","116 collagenase (EC 3.4.24.3) and 0.2 mg/ml pronase E (EC 3.4.24.31) in a low Ca2+ (40 HM)

117 physiological solution (Hanks' balanced salt solution) at 370C. VSMC were obtained by

118 mechanical dispersion. VSMC used for Ca2+ measurements were seeded on glass slides and

119 maintained in short term primary culture in medium M199 containing 5% fetal calf serum

120 (FCS), 20 units/ml penicillin, and 20 pg/ml streptomycin. Cells were kept in an incubator

121 gassed with 95% air and 5% C02 at 370C and used during 24 hours.

122 Packaging of VSMC t0 spaceﬂight - Cells were packed in bags speciﬁc for cell

123 culture in space ﬂight. The packaging and the function of the hardware may be obtained from

124 the CNES and BSA. Brieﬂy, VSMC were in culture in appropriate medium and the hardware

125 contained programmed sequence to release angiotensin 11 (AH) solution (100 nM ﬁnal) to

126 verify their contractile phenotype and after formaldehyde ﬁxative solution (3.7% ﬁnal) to

127 stop cell life after space exposure. The time proﬁle was made to perform these experiments

128 either after 24h 0r 200h of HG exposure. Bags were placed into 6 MAMBA containers

129 (Dutch-Space): 3 in HG conditions and 3 placed in the centrifuge to reproduce 1G with space

130 environment in the KUBIK incubator (COMAT). Finally, to measure eventual effects of

131 travel or space environment, simultaneous and identical experiments were performed on cells

132 kept on Earth.Cells were sent to the 188 with the Soyuz TMA-8 transport mission and

133 returned with the Soyuz TMA-7 transport mission.

134 Immunostaining - We used protocols that were previously described (12). Brieﬂy,

135 ﬁxed VSMC were washed with PBS and permeabilized in PBS containing 2% bovine serum

136 albumin and 1 mg/ml saponin. Anti-RyR antibody (34C, Santa Cruz Biotechnology, 1:1000),

137 anti-ATl receptor antibody (SC-579, 1:500) 0r anti-smooth muscle actin antibody (SC-8432;

138 1:500) was added and cells were incubated overnight at 40C. Fixed portal vein from mice

139 were treated as VSMC but were incubated with anti-Rle (AB9078, Millipore, 1:200) anti-

140 RyR2 (C333, Millipore, 1:200) anti-RyR3 (AB9082, Millipore, 1:200) antibodies. Samples

"
"7","141 were washed 3 times and incubated with the secondary Fluoprobe-488 antibody (1 :250,

142 Interchim) during 45 min at room temperature. After 3 washes in PBS, slides were mounted

143 in Vectashied (Abcys). We have evaluated the non speciﬁc ﬂuorescence of secondary

144 antibody by incubating cells only with the Fluoprobe-488 antibody (1 :250), namely the

145 primary antibody was omitted in the ﬁrst steps. Microscope settings were deﬁned with the

146 non speciﬁc preparation, and the acquisition parameters were kept constant to compare

147 ﬂuorescence emitted in each condition. The ﬂuorescence counting was made only with non -

148 saturated images and analysed as described (12).

149 RT—PCR — Total RNA was extracted from cultured VSMC taken from hepatic portal

150 vein using the RNA preparation kit from Epicentre following the instructions of the supplier.

151 The reverse transcription reaction was performed on 50 ng RNA using the Sensiscript-RT kit

152 (Qiagen). Two different sets of sense and antisense primer pairs speciﬁc for Rle, RyR2 and

153 RyR3 were used as previously described (9). The ﬁrst PCR protocol used with cutured portal

154 vein cells was detailed in (12). In the second one, amplicons produced with CFX96 q-PCR

155 machine (Biorad) were directly quantiﬁed by using CFX96 software. The normalization of

156 RyR expression was realized with rat samples after veriﬁcation of the stability of reference

157 gene expression with GeNorm algorithms; the normalization was made with actin and

158 GAPDH. The normalization used for sample exposed to uG was made with Alien strategy

159 (Agilent technologies). It was consisting in addition of 1 pg of Alien RNA in RNA sample

160 and it was reverse-transcripted during PCR experiments with speciﬁc primer pair.

161 Antisense oligonucleotide treatment - to mimic the decrease in Rle expression,

162 we injected intraperitoneally a solution containing phosphorothioate antisense

163 oligonucleotides (ASON, denoted with the preﬁx “as”) and J etPEI in Vivo (Polyplus).

164 Glucose solutions (5%), containing either asRle associated to the J etPEI in Vivo or only the

165 vector, were injected, following the recommendations of the supplier. After 4 days, a second
7

"
"8","166 injection was performed. Eight days after the ﬁrst inj ection (D8), the rats were euthanized
167 and VSMC were isolated from hepatic portal vein as described above. In order to detect cells
168 containing asRle, we used 5’-Cy5 indocarbocyanin-labelled ASON (Eurogentec). The
169 ﬂuorescence of Cy5 indocyanin was measured at 680 i 32 nm (excitation 647 nm). The
170 sequences of asRle and the scrambled sequence of asRle (asSCR) were previously
171 described(9). The treated rats acted as control rats, without Visible troubles.
172 Contraction ofportal vein strips — portal vein was dissected and opened to remove
173 the endothelium. One muscle strip was taken in the middle of portal vein from rats, calibrated
174 (mass 1 d: 0.2 mg), placed in an unloaded condition, in order to minimize spontaneous
175 contractions, on glass slide coated with Ce11Tak(InVitr0gen), and fully Visualized with LSI
176 macroscope setup (Leica Microsystems). The contraction was evaluated by the shortening of
177 strip in both X and y directions.
178 Western blot analysis - the protocols used were previously described (10). The
179 muscle hepatic portal vein were homogenized in 50 p1 of PBS 10%SDS solution. Supernatant
180 was collected, and the protein content was measured according to the method of Bradford (6).
181 Two different systems of revelations were used and described in supplementary methods.
182 Brieﬂy, in both cases, membranes were incubated (overnight, 40C) with anti-Rle (AB9078)
183 anti-RyR2 (C333) anti-RyR3 (AB9082) primary antibodies (1 : 1000). By using a stripping
184 step, generally 2 different RyR subtypes have been probed per membrane. The secondary
185 antibodies were coupled to a horseradish peroxydase and detected using an enhanced
186 chemolumiscence kit (GE Healthcare) 0r coupled to Q-dot ﬂuorophores (km 655 nm) and
187 signal was detected using a ChemiGenius 2 system (Syngene).
188 Cytosolic Ca2+ measurements on VSM C from hepatic portal vein — Physiological
189 solution was composed as followed in mM: 140 NaCl, 5.6 KCl, 1 MgClz, 2 CaClz, 11
190 glucose, 10 Hepes, pH = 7.4 at 240C with NaOH. Cells were loaded by incubation in a

8

"
"9","191 physiological solution containing 2 HM F1uo-4-AM or F1uo8L-AM and cells were loaded for

192 20 min at 370C. Probes were excited at 488 nm, and emitted ﬂuorescence was ﬁltered and

193 measured at 540 d: 30 nm. Two different modes of image acquisition were used with the

194 confocal system MRC1024ES (Bio-Rad) connected to a Nikon Diaphot microscope: image

195 series were acquired at 1.2 s intervals and 1ine-scan mode images were composed at a rate of

196 2 ms/scan. In this image time increases from left to right. Image processing was performed by

197 using Lasersharp 2000 software (Bio-Rad) and analysis by using IDL software as previously

198 described (12). Background ﬂuorescence was minimized by speciﬁc adjustment of

199 MRC1024ES acquisition parameters. Caffeine, KCl, AH and endothelin-1 (ET1) were

200 applied by pressure ejection from a glass pipette for the period indicated on the records

201 whereas other pharmacological agents were added to the perfused physiological solution. All

202 experiments were carried out at 26 d: 10C.

203 F lash photolysis — cell from portal vein were loaded with the permeant form of

204 InsP3 (cag-iso-2-145-InsP3, 2 HM in M199) during 30 min at 370C before the F1uo8-AM

205 loading. Photolysis produce by the xenon ﬂash lamp (1 ms pulse) has been described

206 previously (40). The ﬂash intensity was adjusted from 150V to 250V in these experiments.

207 Chemicals and Drugs - Collagenase was obtained from Worthington (Freehold, NJ).

223 Results
224 Orbital spaceﬂight decreased RyR expression in isolated vascular smooth muscle cells from
225 hepatic portal vein.
226 To elucidate the effect of HG on RyR expression, vascular smooth muscles cells
227 (VSMC) were isolated from rat hepatic portal vein, on Earth, and maintained in culture
228 conditions designed to preserve their Ca2+ signals and phenotype integrity (Figure 1). In
229 space, Vials containing a ﬁxative solution were mechanically broken in the culture medium
230 after 200 hours of HG exposure. To test the contractile phenotype of the cultured smooth
231 muscle cells, All was release in speciﬁc plastic bags by breaking a ﬁrst Vial 15 min before
232 ﬁxation. After sample return, in All stimulated samples, the preservation of contractile
233 phenotype was revealed by typical images of contracted cells after the labeling of actin
234 ﬁlaments by TRITC-Phalloidin (Figure 1). The proportion of contracted cells in AII-treated
235 samples was about 65 d: 10 % in presence of AH versus 10 d: 5 % in CTL culture medium and
236 was similar for both one G in-ﬂight centrifuged control (1G) and HG (HG) conditions.
237 RyR expression was investigated by RT—qPCR and immunostaining. No variations
238 were found in actin expression between ground (Gr), 1G and HG conditions. Therefore, in
239 each sample, level of actin expression as well as Alien expression were both used to
240 normalize RyR expression. In culture, the expression of RyR2 subtype was progressively

1 0

"
"11","241 decreased. After 8 days in culture medium, the expression of RyR2 became undetectable by
242 RT-qPCR in all experimental conditions (ground control, 1G and HG) with two different pairs
243 of primers. Interestingly, the Rle expression was signiﬁcantly decreased (67%) at the
244 mRNA level in HG compared to Gr and 1G in-ﬂight control conditions whereas the RyR3
245 expression was unchanged in the three different conditions (Figure 2A). At the protein level,
246 the limited number of samples allowed only an analysis based on the quantiﬁcation of
247 immunostaining with an antibody directed against a common RyR epitope (34C monoclonal
248 antibody). Firstly, we have veriﬁed that the non-speciﬁc ﬂuorescence was not modiﬁed in the
249 three studied conditions. And then, a signiﬁcant decrease in RyR speciﬁc ﬂuorescence (47%)
250 was revealed in cells exposed to HG (Figure 2B-C). The HG is a unique environment because
251 there is no force applied on the system. Therefore, by culturing VSMC in a HG environment,
252 it allows one to study the inﬂuence of one particular variable, in this case, blood pressure.
253 We have also veriﬁed if the transport of samples was deleterious for cell Viability and
254 RyR subtype expression by performing RT-qPCR on two different speciﬁc additive cassettes
255 ﬁxed exactly at the same time but stored in laboratory and on the launch area just before the
256 launch. There was no difference in the level of expression of RyR subtypes between cell
257 samples stored in laboratory and those that have traveled (Rle/actin = 0.61 d: 0.09 versus
258 0.48 d: 0.13; RyR2/actin = 0.20i0.08 versus 0.26i0.07; RyR3/actin = 0.70 d: 0.05 versus 0.74
259 d: 0.07 in laboratory versus traveled samples respectively).
260 RyR] expression was also decreased in portal vein from mouse exposed to orbital
26 1 spaceﬂight.
262 With similar protocol we have investigated the expression of RyR subtypes in portal vein
263 from mice exposed to HG for the same duration during the STS-118 mission. The RT-qPCR
264 experiments revealed that the expression of Rle was decreased (-61%) whereas RyR2 and
265 RyR3 expressions were not changed (Figure 3A). This result was also conﬁrmed at the

1 1

"
"12","266 protein 1eve1by analysis of confocal microscopy stacks of RyR immunostaining because a

267 westernblot analysis was not possible because the size of sample was too small. The

268 immunolabelling using an anti-Rle antibody was decreased (-43%), whereas the

269 immunostainnings 0f RyR2 and RyR3 revealed with speciﬁc antibodies against RyR2 and

270 RyR3 respectively were not changed (Figure 3B-C).

271 RyR] expression is decreased by both H U and intraperitoneal injection ofanti-RyRI

272 antisense oligonucleotides in portal vein.

273 The HU rat model has been widely used during the 1asttw0 decades to mimic the

274 ﬂuid volume redistribution induced by HG. In portal vein, we previously demonstrated that

275 the [3H]ryan0dine binding was decreased by HU (40). To compare the effect of the decrease

276 in gravitational force with the decrease in hemodynamic force on VSMC, we investigated the

277 RyR expression pattern in hepatic portal vein from control (CTL) and HU rats. the RT-qPCR

278 revealed, a signiﬁcantly decrease of Rle expression in HU rats compared to CTL rats

279 whereas the expression levels of RyR2 and RyR3 were identical in both conditions (Figure

280 4A). To assess the Rle expression variation at the protein level, western blots were made

281 with protein extracted from portal vein from CTL and HU rats (Figure 4B). The intensity of

282 anti-RyR bands were normalized against an anti-actin antibody. The ratio of Rle to actin

283 was signiﬁcantly lower in portal vein taken from HU rats than from CTL, whereas the ratio

284 of RyR2 0r RyR3 to actin were not modiﬁed (Figure 4C) RyR1 expression is thus decreased

285 by the reduced infero-posterior blood pressure induced by HU.

286 T0 mimic the decrease of Rle expression, we developed an in vivo approach by

287 antisense oligonucleotide (ASON) directed against RyR1 (asRle). Localization of the

288 ASON in the VSMC was assessed by ﬂuorescence microscopy using a Cy5-tagged asRyR1.

289 Inhibition of the Rle expression was investigated by RT-qPCR, following the same

290 methodology as described earlier (Figure 4A). In rats inj ected with the cationic vector only,
12

"
"13","291 the Rle/actin ratio was similar to the ratio measured in CTL rat. Injection of asRyR1 causes

292 similar reduction of the RyR1/actin ratio as observed in HU animals without effect on

293 RyR2/actin and RyR3/actin ratios. Western analysis showed that ASON treatment reduced the

294 density of the Rle protein band (Figure 4D). The RyR1/actin ratio was -58.5 d: 18.7% less

295 in ASON—treated than in vehicle-treated animals. The asRyR1 in ViVO injection had no effect

296 on RyR2 and RyR3 expression (Figure 4E).

297 Rle has a functional role in portal vein VSM C adaptation to H U conditions.

298 To assess the role of Rle in hepatic portal vein adaptation to infero-posterior

299 decreased blood pressure, different Ca2+ signals were compared between myocytes isolated

300 from CTL, HU and asRle-treated rats.

301 To measure the RyR-dependent Ca2+ release, caffeine (10 mmol/L), known to activate

302 RyRs by increasing their sensitivity to Ca2+ activation, was applied by puff on isolated

303 VSMC from portal vein. Amplitudes and upstroke velocity of induced Ca2+ responses were

304 identical between myocytes isolated from CTL and vehicle-treated rats and were thus pooled

305 in the following experiments. Line-scan mode with a line acquired each 2 ms conﬁrmed these

306 differences and revealed a decreased upstroke velocity in HU and asRle-treated myocytes

307 compared to control cells (Figure 5A). Mean amplitude of caffeine-induced Ca2+ responses

308 was decreased in HU and asRle-treated rats without any signiﬁcant difference between

309 these two last conditions (Figure 5B). A SERCA inhibitor was used to check the effect of HU

310 and asRyR1 inj ections 0n Ca2+ store reﬁlling. The use of IHM thapsigargin and the

311 reproducibility of the responses between CTL, HU and asRle-treated rats suggested that the

312 SR Ca2+ loading was unchanged (not shown).

313 In 1997, we showed a reduced cytosolic Ca2+ response evoked by angiotensin 11 (AH)

314 in hepatic VSMC from HU rats (40). Then AH (100 nM) was ﬁrst tested on VSMC from

315 CTL, HU and asRyR1 injected rats. As expected, HU decreased the amplitude of Ca2+ signal

317 (Figure 6A, upper panel). Interestingly intraperitoneal injections of asRle also reduced the
318 AII-evoked Ca2+response (Figure 6A, lower panel). In presence of 10 HM ryanodine for 30
319 min, the amplitude of AII-evoked Ca2+ responses was decreased to a similar level in CTL,
320 HU, and asRle inj ected rats suggesting that only changes in RyR function were responsible
321 of the decreased AH -induced Ca2+ response in HU and asRle conditions (Figure 6B). We
322 also evaluated the effect of asRle and HU conditions on the AII-induced contraction (100
323 nmol/L) measuring the shortening of portal vein strip placed on microscope setup used for
324 Ca2+ measurement. The contraction of portal vein was decreased by HU from 22 d: 3 % (n =
325 11) in CTL conditions to 12 d: 1 % (n = 12) in HU conditions as well as it was decreased
326 from 17 d: 1 % (n = 15) to 11 d: 2 % (n = 20) in asRle treated animals. This last result
327 indicated that the decrease of Ca2+ signal possibly reduced the contraction induced by AH.
328 As RyRs can be physiologically activated by a local increase in intracellular Ca2+, we
329 tested the ability of the HU and asRle treatment to modify this mechanism called Ca2+-
330 induced Ca2+ release (CICR). The CICR mechanism can also be activated by membrane
331 depolarization, leading to the opening of L-type Ca2+ channels and thus intracellular Ca2+
332 elevation. KCl (140 mmol/L) was applied by puff on isolated VSMC (Figure 7A): as a result,
333 the induced Ca2+ responses were lower in HU and asRle groups than in CTL group
334 whereas this difference was ablated by 10 pmol/L ryanodine (Figure 7B-C).
335 We completed the investigation by the analysis of Ca2+ signal induced by ETl (100
336 nM), known to activate 1P3 production (29).The amplitude of ETl-induced Ca2+ responses
337 was decreased from 5.4 d: 0.3 (n = 39, CTL) to 4.2 d: 0.3 ratio units (n = 41, HU, p < 0.05, one
338 way ANOVA test) and to 3.9 d: 0.3 ratio units (n = 33, asRle-treated rats, p < 0.05, one way
339 ANOVA test). The mean amplitudes of the ETl-evoked Ca2+ response in HU and asRle-
340 inj ected rats were similar. In presence of 10 HM ryanodine, the mean amplitude of ETl-

14

"
"15","341 evoked Ca2+ responses was similar in all conditions (CTL: 1.6 d: 0.3 (n = 16), HU: 2.1 d: 0.4
342 (n = 25), asRle-injected rats: 1.8 d: 0.3 (n = 10)) suggesting that in infero-posterior VSMCs,
343 the IP3R expression is not modiﬁed by HU condition. Taken together these results clearly
344 show the decrease in the RyR expression is sufﬁcient to mimic the alteration of Ca2+
345 signaling induced by HU in VSMC from hepatic portal.
346 RyR] was also regulated in portal vein VSM C from hypertensive model.
347 Finally, the SHR model could be used as the opposite model to HG and hindlimb
348 suspension because if these last conditions induced a decrease of portal vein blood pressure
349 (1), 0n the contrary, the blood pressure was increased in SHR model. Then, to complete our
350 study, we wanted to analyze the RyR-dependent Ca2+ signaling in VSMC from SHR and
351 WKR portal veins. Firstly, the caffeine-induced Ca2+ release was signiﬁcantly increased in
352 VSMC from SHR portal vein in comparison with those obtained from WKR (Figure
353 8A; AF/FO = 4.48 d: 0.26, n = 51 in SHR versus 2.94 d: 0.15, n = 23, in WKR, p < 0.05, t-test).
354 Because the expression patterns of the ET—l receptors were regulated in SHR model, the
355 implication of RyR into the CICR induced by 1P3 pathway using ET—1 was not possible.
356 Then, we use the photolysis of cag-is0-2-145-IP3 to activate IP3-dependent Ca2+ signals. In
357 portal vein VSMC loaded with cag-is0-2-145-InsP3, the UV. ﬂash induced a Ca2+ signal
358 whose the amplitude was signiﬁcantly increased in SHR in comparison with WKR (Figure
359 8B; AF/FO = 3.50 d: 0.13, n = 53 in SHR versus 1.77 d: 0.03, n = 48, in WKR at 100V
360 intensity; and AF/FO = 5.17 d: 0.47, n = 53 in SHR versus 2.37 d: 0.20 n = 48 in WKR at 200V
361 intensity). As also illustrated in Figure 8C, the KCl-induced Ca2+ response was signiﬁcantly
362 increased in SHR in comparison with WKR. The application of 10 pmol/L ryanodine induced
363 a more important decrease of KCl-induced Ca2+ response in SHR than in WKR (-68.3 d: 7.1%
364 versus -29.9 d: 4.2 %, n = 6 different experiments) suggesting that the participation of CICR
365 was more important in SHR than in WKR.

"
"16","366 Finally, the expression of RyR subtype was investigated in SHR and WKR by RT-

367 qPCR. Only the expression of Rle subtype was increased in SHR (Figure 9) indicating an

368 opposite effect to those observed in VSMC from HU rats or HG exposed mice and HG

369 exposed VSMC.

371 Discussion

372 The molecular basis of physiological effects of vascular adaptation to HG must be

373 investigated at several levels. Indeed, vascular reactivity could be modiﬁed by changes in cell

374 interactions, contractile proteins and transduction pathways. The modiﬁcations could affect

375 the expression level but also the functional state of proteins implicated in regulation of

376 contraction. Vascular reactivity is due to the VSMC contraction/relaxation balance. The

377 regulation of this balance is assumed by endothelial function principally Via NO synthesis

378 and by the regulation of Ca2+ signaling pathway of the VSMC. Here, we have investigated the

379 regulation of Ca2+ signal encoding by HG and vessel pressure.

380 VSM C are directly sensitive to the real ,uG

381 Firstly, to delineate the relative contribution of vascular smooth muscle from the

382 endothelial component in terms of the vascular adaptation to HG, experiments were

383 performed in cultured VSMC. The expressions of RyR protein and Rle mRNA were

384 decreased in cultured VSMC exposed to HG during TMA-8 spaceﬂight. These results

385 suggested that Ca2+ signaling pathways were affected by HG. But, one of the important

386 challenges of this part of our work was to maintain the closest possible phenotype of the

387 initial situation in the cultured VSMC. The presence of calf serum in culture medium is

388 necessary to maintain the VSMC Viability but it also induced a dedifferentiation from a

389 contractile to a proliferative phenotype, characterized by decreased SERCAZA and RyR

390 expression and increased InsP3R, SOC and CaV3(26,33,34,53). As we described previously,
1 6

"
"17","391 the use calf serum decomplementation limits the VSMC proliferation(3 6) and the expression
392 of RyR subtypes was not signiﬁcantly modiﬁed during four days(9) but after 8 days only the
393 RyR2 expression decreased to a level undetectable by RT—PCR. However the RyR-dependent
394 Ca2+ response and the contractile phenotype remained after 8 days, showing a preserved
395 VSMC integrity. These culture conditions are usable to follow the effect of HG on Ca2+
396 signaling, despite a possible effect on RyR2 expression. There is no evidence in our work that
397 HG induced drastic modiﬁcations of VSMC survival and proliferation, while RyR2 could be
398 necessary to Ca2+ signals implicated in portal vein VSMC proliferation. In adherent cells,
399 both real and simulated HG (clinorotation) decreased cell mitosis(37,54). The differences
400 between our work and these studies are due to the experimental procedures. Indeed, we
401 deﬁned particular conditions to maximally inhibit the cell proliferation. By indirect
402 measurement, we have also shown that the contractile phenotype was preserved in HG
403 because AII was still able to induced contraction of VSMC and there was no modiﬁcation in
404 the proportion of contracted cells between 1G and HG samples. Finally, at this stage of
405 investigation we cannot exclude that the decrease in Rle expression in HG can also be due,
406 at least partly, to a decreased VSMC metabolism as observed in cultured cells in clinorotation
407 (7). In the vascular physiology, it will be important to use the HG environment to
408 characterized the pressure sensor and the level of gravity change that is perceptible by the
409 VSMC as performed in vegetal root cells (16).
410 In HG conditions, the VSMC have been packaged in Earth atmosphere and only the
411 gravity was not applied on cells in the ISS environment; blood and adjacent tissues pressures
412 were then absent. The use of animals living in space environment has been necessary to
413 verify if the effect of HG observed in cultured VSMC made sense in vascular physiology.
414 In portal vein from mice exposed to HG during the STS-118 Endeavour mission, the
415 expression of Rle was decreased as observed in cultured VSMC indicating a molecular

1 7

"
"18","416 adaptation to real HG and potentially to changes in applied forces.
417 In speciﬁc situation, the forces applied on cells change and modify the gene
418 expression pattern as observed in myometrium near parturition (10,25), portal hypertension
419 (48) or in renal hypertonic stress (31). Taken together, these results suggest that VSMC can
420 rapidly (8 days) adapt their Ca2+ signaling pathways to HG during spaceﬂight and probably to
421 blood pressure as observed in hypertensive situation.
422 Our study is the ﬁrst direct demonstration showing that the absence of force obtained
423 by HG exposure during spaceﬂight induces a modulation of VSMC and that reinforces the
424 “pressure effect theory” indicating that the intravascular pressure is a key regulator of
425 vascular reactivity.
426 The asRle in vivo treatment induces the decrease in vascular reactivity
427 To investigate the signiﬁcance of ttG-induced RyR1 decrease in Ca2+ signaling, we
428 have induced the decrease of Rle expression in rat by intraperitoneal inj ection 0f asRyR1.
429 The speciﬁc decrease in Rle expression was followed at mRNA and protein levels and was
430 responsible for decreases in Ca2+ responses induced by AH, ET1, and depolarization. This
431 result indicates diverse Ca2+ signals are modiﬁed to likely affect many cell functions such as
432 contraction and proliferation. Firstly, the decrease in contraction was suggested by the
433 decrease in Ca2+ signals evoked by vasoconstrictors such as depolarization, ET1, AH, and
434 NE in our previous work(40). In the same way we have veriﬁed in confocal microscopy that
435 AII-induced contraction of portal vein strips was signiﬁcantly decreased asRyR1 treatments.
436 These experiments showed that the level of Rle expression was determinant to encode the
437 magnitude and upstroke velocity of CICR in VSMC conﬁrming others studies using Rle
438 KO (19,32). In a previous work, we have determined that the 80% inhibition of Rle
439 expression by asRyR1, in cultured VSMC from the same model, decreased the amplitude and
440 the upstroke velocity of caffeine-activated Ca2+ response in range of 60% and 80%

1 8

"
"19","441 respectively(9). Here, the effect of asRle and HU were similar probably because the effects
442 of the used concentration of asRle inhibits Rle expression in the same range to those
443 observed with HU .
444 But at this stage of the discussion, we cannot link together the decrease of Rle
445 expression level as adaptation to the decrease of pressure. To have some arguments to discuss
446 this point, we have compared results obtained on asRle treated animals and HU rats. This
447 last model was admitted to mimic vascular adaptation to HG because HU reproduce the
448 hyporeactiVity of infero-posterior vessels.
449 The H U decreases the Rle expression
450 The observed decrease of AII-induced contraction of portal vein strips in HU could be
451 considered as a conﬁrmation to the decrease in vasoconstriction that was also found in other
452 peripheral vessels from HU rats including abdominal aorta, femoral, pulmonary and
453 mesenteric arteries (4,8,15,46,47). In infero-posterior veins the effect of HU is less clear than
454 in arteries. HU also decreased, in few days, the NE-induced contraction in vena cava but it
455 was due to the modiﬁcations of transduction pathways Via al-adrenoceptor desensitization
456 (50). The decrease of contraction in mesenteric veins from Sprague-Dawley rats was also
457 observed (4,17) but on the contrary Purdy and coworkers concluded that jugular and femoral
458 veins were globally not sensitive to HU (47). In these last models, the effects could be also
459 analyzed by focusing on the nature of vasoconstrictors: NE-induced contraction was
460 unchanged whereas KCl-induced contraction was inhibited in HU rats. This last point would
461 be consistent with our study indicating the evidence that IP3R Ca2+ release is not affected by
462 HU (NE pathway), while CICR is affected (CICR between VDCC-induced Ca2+ inﬂux and
463 RyR).
464 However, the molecular basis of vascular adaptation to HU could be due to GPCR-
465 activated pathway as suggested (3,50), but it was not sufﬁcient to explain the observed

1 9

"
"20","466 decrease in depolarization-induced and caffeine-induced contraction even if the activation of
467 GPCR by depolarization was possible (35). In 1997, we showed for the ﬁrst time that RyR
468 expression is modiﬁed by HU conditions and may explain the decrease in vasoreactiVity of
469 portal vein (40). In 2008, Colleran and co-workers associated a decrease in RyR2 expression
470 in HU rats with diminished vasoconstrictor responses to KCl, NE and caffeine in mesenteric
471 resistance arteries (8). The apparent discordance of their results with ours might be explained
472 in that they only detected RyR2 and RyR3 mRNA expression. We have shown that Rle and
473 RyR2 functions seemed to be interchangeable in VSMC (9). So it is not surprising to observe
474 a HU-induced decrease in RyR2 expression in absence of Rle protein. The origin of this
475 different RyR subtype expression pattern could lie in the tissue used (10,1 1,3 8).
476 Finally, the present study might explain the medical observation during bed-rest
477 experiments indicating a signiﬁcant splanchnic blood stagnation. Indeed a decreased
478 contractility 0f the portal vein appears to be linked to a decreased RyR1 function (2). With
479 mesenteric vessels, portal vein is the most important blood reserve; a loss of VSMC
480 contractile ability in HG can induce the decrease in portal vein abi1ityt0 transport the blood
481 and then becomes essential in spaceﬂight-consecutive orthostatic intolerance. The second
482 consequence of the decrease in Ca2+ signals can be the remodeling of the vascular wall. In
483 fact, HU-induced decreased contraction was associated to vascular hypotrophy in aorta and
484 skeletal muscle arteries (14,21), but this point must be studied more precisely by following
485 the proliferative pathway at the molecular level.
486 Regulation ofRyRI expression was also observed in SHR hypertension model
487 The decrease in Rle expression observed in HU model or after HG exposure is
488 possibly due to the drop of pressure applied on cells or blood pressure in vessels. Our results
489 obtained from SHR, shown that the chronic increase in blood pressure produces the opposite
490 effect. Our results could also explain several effects observed in SHR model. In fact, the

20

"
"21","491 increase of Rle expression and the associated increase of Ca2+ signaling could explain the
492 increase of the contraction induced by depolarization, caffeine and agonists (29,30,43,49) but
493 also and the effect of inhibitor of sarcoplasmic reticulum Ca2+ stores (18).
494 In conclusion, our study shows that, during spaceﬂight, HG affects directly cultured
495 VSMC by modulating the same molecular target than hemodynamic changes. Thus HG-
496 induced blood pressure changes should induce the regulation of Rle expression in the same
497 way. Nevertheless it is necessary to investigate as soon as possible the sensor of gravity
498 and/or blood pressure variation and pathways activated to regulate gene expression to adapt
499 the Ca2+ pathways to understand the basis of vascular adaptation to spaceﬂight but also to
500 give new target to control and regulate blood pressure in hypertensive and hypotensive
501 situations.
