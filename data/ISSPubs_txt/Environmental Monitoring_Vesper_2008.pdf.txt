Abstract
Dust was collected over a period of several weeks in 2007 from HEPA ﬁlters in the
US. Laboratory Module 0f the International Space Station (188). The dust was returned
011 the Space Shuttle Atlantis, mixed, sieved, and the DNA was extracted. Using a DNA-
based method called mold specific quantitative PCR (MSQPCR), 39 molds were
measured in the dust. Potential opportunistic pathogens Aspergillus ﬂaws and A. niger
and potential moderate toxin producers Penicillium chrj/sogenum and P. brevicompacmm
were noteworthy. N0 cells of the potential opportunistic pathogens A. fumigatus, A.
terreus, F usarium solam’ 0r Candida albicans were detected.

"2","1. Introduction

Since human space exploration began, microbes have traveled with us and are
ubiquitous throughout the spacecraft. Previous studies have demonstrated that bacteria,
including potential pathogens, were commonly isolated in the air, water, and 011 surfaces
aboard the Mir Space Station [12] and the International Space Station (188) [1,6].
Bioﬁlms were found in the water distribution lines 011 the Space Shuttle Discovery [5].

Another important group of microbes are the fungi 0r molds. Molds like Penicillium
chrysogenum were measured on the Mir Space Station from the beginning of its on-orbit
service [19]. SiX “space fungi” including P. chrj/sogenum and Aspergillus versicolor
were identiﬁed by morphology and sequence analysis and were shown to be amplifying
0n the Mir [7]. The authors concluded that “the environment aboard the space station
Mir allows the growth (of mold) as (is) true in residential areas on earth”. A siX year
survey of the 188 showed the concentration of molds ranged from a high of less than 4.4
X 101 CFU/m3 air to 4.3 X 104 CPU per 100 01112 of surfaces [11]. However, these
analyses were all based on culturing the molds. It is important that timely information
about the concentration of molds in the 188 is available, since molds present a threat to
the integrity of the health of the cosmonauts/astronauts manning the ISS and the
components of the ISS itself [11].

Potential health threats from molds include infections, toxicity and allergic reactions
such as asthma. Although most molds are not a threat to humans with a healthy immune
system, numerous studies have shown that the immune system of many astronauts were
affected as a result of space ﬂight and habitation [3,4,8,9,13,15,16]. Most parameters of
the immune system were altered, usually decreased, resulting from various factors

"3","associated with space ﬂight. However, mold infections usually occur only in the severely
immuno-compromised. Although no known mold related health effects have occurred
among the astronauts as a result of their time aboard the ISS, monitoring of these mold
species is important for evaluating the threat.

Mold growth is also potentially problematic for the integrity and operation of the ISS
itself. Molds are saprophytic and therefore, to grow and multiply, they must breakdown
organic substrates, which could be parts of the 188 (Figure 1).

In this study, a rapid (<2 hour), DNA-based method of mold analysis called mold
speciﬁc quantitative PCR (MSQPCR) was used to identify and quantify mold species
found in the dust collected aboard the 188. The focus was the 36 species common to
environments on earth, as described by the Environmental Relative Moldiness Index
(ERMI) [17], and three additional opportunistic pathogens.

2. Materials and methods

A vacuum bag dust sample was collected from HEPA ﬁlters in the US. Laboratory
module of the ISS. HEPA ﬁlters are strategically installed at selected ""returns"" located
throughout the US segment of the International Space Station. Vacuuming 0f the HEPA
ﬁlters is a part of the nominal housekeeping activities on-board the 188. The dust was
returned 011 the Space Shuttle Atlantis in 2007. The dust was thoroughly mixed and then
sieved through a 300 micron pore size nylon mesh (Gilson Company, Inc. Lewis Center,
OH). The DNA was extracted and purified from the samples using the GeneRite DNA-
EZTM kit, as directed (KC101-04C-50; GeneRite, Kendal Park, NJ). Two replicate
analyses of 5.0 i 0.1 mg dust each from the sample were performed [17]. All primer and

3

"
"4","probe sequences, as well as known species comprising any assay cluster were published
at the EPA website: http://www.epa.gOV/rnicrobes/rnoldtechhtrn. Negative as well as
positive controls for each assay were tested along with the dust analysis.

3. Results and discussion

The results of the MSQPCR analysis of the dust from the 188 are shown in Table 1.
The most common species measured was P. chrysogenum (average 350 cell equivalents
per mg dust) followed by Aureobasidium pullulcms (average 96 cell equivalents per mg
dust). Of the 36 species in the standard ERMI analysis, 17 were detected at some
concentration. Three additional opportunistic pathogens, A. terreus, F usarium solani,
and Candida albicans, were not detected in the dust (data not given).

Common species causing aspergillosis that were detected included, A. ﬂaws and A.
niger (average 27 and 92 cell equivalents per mg dust, respectively). Additional,
occasional pathogens and toxin producing species measured on the 188 were P.
brevicompacmm and A. sydowii (average 32 and 16 cell equivalents per mg dust,
respectively). Stachybotrys chartarum was not detected in the ISS dust.

This 188 dust sample contained the opportunistic pathogens A. ﬂaws and A. niger at
concentrations higher than the geometric mean measured in homes across the US. [17].
Just as important, the tests demonstrated that other opportunistic pathogens including, A.
fumigatus, A. terreus, F . solam' and C. albicans were not present (at least at this time and
in this sample).

"
"5","In addition to infections, many molds produce mycotoxins and allergens which can
affect the immune system and other organs. For example A. ﬂavus is the source of
aﬂatoxin, a known carcinogen. Other molds quantiﬁed by MSQPCR 0n the 188 included
P. Chrysogenum and P. brevicompacmm which produce toxins that can cause
inﬂammatory and cytotoxic responses [14]. These toxins or allergens may be active,
even if the cells that possess them are not Viable.

Historically, the ISS environment was monitored by both the US. and Russia in their
respective modules by periodically collecting samples from the air and various surfaces
[12]. The air and surface samples collected by astronauts in the US. segment were
incubated on-board the ISS and colony counts recorded by the crew. This approach gave
the crew an estimate of the number of Viable microbes relatively quickly (depending on
microbial growth rate). However, for identiﬁcation of the microbes, the cultures were
returned to earth. Typically Russian cosmonauts collected air samples and the crew
recorded the number of bacterial and mold colonies after incubation [10]. However,
surface samples were collected and stabilized for return to earth, where the microbes
were cultured, identified and quantified.

Novikova et a1. [11] described two fundamental limitations in these methods used to
monitor microorganisms 0n the 188: the time gap between sampling and results and the
reliance on culture-based analyses. The DNA-based method applied in this study can
solve both of these problems. Although, in this case, the dust sample was returned to
earth for analysis, a number of companies are developing closed instrumentation
platforms, e.g. the IQuurn (see www.iguum.com) that would make this analysis available
011 a nearly real-tirne basis and could potentially be performed 011 the 18$.

"6","It would also be desirable to know Which mold cells are Viable. New methods for
discriminating Viable and non-Viable mold cells, in conjunction With MSQPCR, are
becoming available [18]. The results are specific, quantitative and available in about 2
hours. In most cases, the MSQPCR assays are sensitive down to a single cell [2].

Great effort is made to prevent the introduction of molds and bacteria into the 188. For
example, the 188 was designed to prevent surfaces from collecting condensate and to
keep the relative humidity less than 70%. HEPA ﬁlter are used in the air reclamation and
distribution system.

In addition, all modules launched to join and expand the 188 are assembled in clean
rooms, and exposed surfaces are disinfected With hydrogen peroxide (3-6%). Hardware
is randomly sampled to ensure compliance With standards. Prior to launch, module
surfaces are sampled With swabs and/or contact plates to ensure compliance With
stringent acceptability limits, i.e. 100 colony forming units (ofu) / 100 cm2 for molds and
10,000 ofu/ 100 cm2 for bacteria. The air in the module is also monitored using a small
portable air sampler. Aoceptability limits are 100 ofu / m3 of air for molds and 1000 ofu/
m3 for bacteria.

During the ﬂight phase, the air and surfaces are monitored to ensure compliance With
acceptability limits. Routine housekeeping, including Wiping surfaces is conducted
weekly by the crew. Any monitoring that detects levels of bacteria or molds above the
acceptability limits prompts a olean-up by the crew using a quaternary ammonium
disinfectant. The HEPA ﬁlters are protected by a grid and these are routinely vacuumed
to remove accumulated materials. However, molds and other microorganisms can still

Soyuz.
4. Conclusions and perspective

It is important to emphasize that there have been no known mold infections or other
health effects from molds as a result of living aboard the 188. Of course, this is just one
sample and many more samples would be needed to fully describe the mold conditions of
the ISS. Novikova et 211., [11] opined “Continuous environmental monitoring during the
lifetime of the 188 is of paramount importance.” The use of MSQPCR may be one
method to reach this goal.
