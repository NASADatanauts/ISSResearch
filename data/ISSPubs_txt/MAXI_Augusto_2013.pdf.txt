On April 24, 2012, at 16:47:14 UT, the Gas Slit Camera (GSC) of the Japanese Monitor of All-sky
X—ray Image (MAXI) instrument on the International Space Station detected a short X-ray transient
lasting about 34 seconds. The MAXI/GSC transient was most likely a gamma-ray burst (GRB),
because of the high Galactic latitude, spectral hardness ratio, and the absence of known bright X-ray
sources at the detected position. In addition, the MAXI/GSC transient GRB 120424A coordinates
were in the ﬁeld of View of the inclined Tupi muon telescope located at ground level (3 rn above sea
level) at (229° W, 432° S) in the South Atlantic Anomaly region. We report here that the Tupi
telescope registered a muon excess with a signal signiﬁcance 6.20- within the MAXI/GSC transient
time period. Assuming a power law function with a spectral indeX of y = —1.54 in the tail of the
primary garnrna-ray energy spectrum, we can conclude that the ﬂuence obtained from the muon
excess detected by the Tupi telescope is consistent with the preliminary value obtained by the MAXI
team. This result agrees with an assumption that the muons were produced in photonuelear reactions
in the Earth’s atmosphere. In addition, we show also that the South Atlantic Anomaly region can be a
favorable place at ground for the detection of the tail of the energy spectrum (the GeV counterpart) of
some GRBs.
