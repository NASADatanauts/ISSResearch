Abstract. Astronaut-acquired orbital photographs (astronaut photographs) are
a useful complement to images taken by orbiting satellites. They are in the public
domain, and have been particularly useful for scientists in developing countries,
as supplementary low-cloud data, and for studies requiring large numbers of
images. Depending on camera, lens and 100k angle, digitized astronaut photo-
graphs can have pixel sizes representing areas on the Earth as small as 10m or
less, although most photographs suitable for digital remote sensing have pixel
sizes between 30 m and 60m. The Objective of this paper is to provide a practical
reference for scientists in a variety of disciplines who want to use astronaut
photographs as remote sensing data. The Characteristics of astronaut photography
systems that inﬂuence spatial resolution are detailed and previous image acqui-
sitions relative to these elements are summarized. Methods are presented for
estimating ground coverage under three different levels of assumptions, to meet
accuracy needs of different users. Of the more than 375000 photographs taken
to date, at least half have the potential to be used as a source of digital remote
sensing data.
1. Introduction
1.1. Overview of N ASA astronaut photograph y
Astronaut photography of Earth is produced and archived by the National
Aeronautics & Space Administration (NASA) and provides an important record of
the state of the Earth that has not been used to its potential (Lulla et al. 1996). The
practice was the foundation for the development of other forms of orbital remote
sensing (Lowman 1999). Although the geometry is more complex than that of a
vertical aerial photograph, astronaut photographs still provide information that can
be interpreted by knowledgeable observers (Ring and Eyre 1983, Lowman 1985,
Rasher and Weaver 1990, Drury 1993, Campbell 1996: 121—156, Arnold 1997).
Ofﬁcial NASA campaigns of terrain, ocean, and atmospheric photography were
carried out during the Gemini missions (Underwood 1967, Lowman and Tiedemann

1971), the Earth-orbitin g Apollo missions (Colwell 1971), the Apollo-Soyuz mission
(El-Baz 1977, El-Baz and Warner 1979), Skylab (NASA 1974, Wilmarth et al. 1977),
a few Shuttle missions (e.g. the two Space Radar Laboratory missions of 1994, J ones
et al. 1996), and the Shuttle-Mir missions (Evans et al. 2000). Extensive training in
photography is available to members of all ﬂight crews, during their general trainin g
period and during intensive training for speciﬁc missions (Jones et al. 1996). Most
photographs have been taken by astronauts on a time-available basis. Astronaut
photographs are thus a subset of the potential scenes, selected both by opportunity
(orbital parameters, lighting, and crew workloads and schedules) and by the training,
experience, and interest of the photographers.

As remote sensing and geographic information systems have become more widely
available tools, we have collaborated with a number of scientists interested in using
astronaut photography for quantitative remote sensing applications. Digitized images
from ﬁlm are suitable for geometric rectiﬁcation and image enhancement followed by
classiﬁcation and other remote sensin g techniques (Lulla and Helfert 1989, Mohler et al.
1989, Helfert et al. 1990, Lulla et al. 1991, Eekardt et al. 2000, Robinson et al. 2000a,
2000c: and in press, Webb et al. in press). The photographs are in the public domain,
thus, they provide a low-eost alternative data source for cases where commercial imagery
cannot be acquired. Such cases often include studies in developin g countries, in areas
that have not usually been targets for major satellites, needing supplemental low-cloud
data, requirin g a time series, or requiring a large number of images.

1.2. Extent of the dataset

As of 30 September 1999, 378 461 frames were included in the photograph
database (Ofﬁce of Earth Sciences 2000) comprising 99 missions from Mercury 3
(21 July 1961) through STS-96 (27 May to 6 June 1999). The database was reviewed,
removing photographs that were deemed unsuitable for remote sensing analysis
because they were not Earth—lookin g (no entry for tilt angle), had no estimated focal
length, were over- or undereXposed, or were taken at oblique tilt angles (further
discussion of these characteristics follows). The remaining 190911 frames (50.4% of
the records present in the database) represent photographs that are potentially
suitable for remote sensing data. As the database is always having new photography
added, statistics can be updated on request using the web link ‘Summary of Database
Contents’ at the Gateway to Astronaut Photography of Earth (Ofﬁce of Earth
Sciences 2000).

1.3. Objectives

The overall purpose of this paper is to provide understandin g of the properties of
astronaut—a cquired orbital photographs to help scientists evaluate their applicability
for digital remote sensing. Previous general descriptions of astronaut photography
have been much less extensive and have tended to focus on numbers of photographs
taken and geographic coverage, and emphasized interpretative applications (Helfert
and Wood 1989, Lulla et al. 1993, 1994, 1996). By providing a unique compilation
of the background information necessary to extend the use of astronaut photography
beyond interpretation to rigorous analysis, it is hoped to provide a resource for
scientists who could use this data in a variety of disciplines. In keeping with a
potential interdisciplinary audience, we have tried to provide sufﬁcient background
information for scientists who do not have extensive training in remote sensing.

We focus on spatial resolution because it is one of the most important factors

"

determining the suitability of an image for a remote sensing objective. In remote
sensing literature, spatial resolution for aerial photography is often treated very
differently from spatial resolution of multispeetral scanning sensors. To provide
suﬁieient background for a discussion of spatial resolution for a data source that
shares properties with both aerial photography and satellite remote sensing, we
ﬁrst summarize the ways that spatial resolution is typically quantiﬁed for aerial
photography and satellite remote sensors.

Given this background information, we (1) describe and illustrate factors that
inﬂuence the spatial resolution of astronaut photographs, (2) show examples of
estimating spatial resolution for a variety of photographs in a way that will
enable users to make these calculations whether or not they have a background in
photogrammetry, and (3) compare spatial resolution of digital data extracted from
astronaut photographs to data obtained from other satellites.

2. Background—Spatial resolution of imaging systems

Spatial resolution is a fundamental property of any imaging system used to
collect remote sensing data, and directly determines the spatial scale of the resultant
information. Resolution seems intuitively obvious, but its technical deﬁnition and
precise application in remote sensing have been complex. For example, Townshend
(1980) summarized 13 different ways to estimate the resolving power of the Landsat
MultiSpeetral Scanner (MSS). Simonett (1983, p. 20) stated ‘In the simplest case,
spatial resolution may be deﬁned as the minimum distance between two objects that
a sensor can record distinctly...[but] it is the format of the sensor system that
determines how spatial resolution is measured’. By focusing attention on the proper-
ties of the system (and not the images acquired) this deﬁnition can be applied to a
variety of types of images provided by different systems. In order to provide as
complete a treatment as possible, background is provided on several Views of spatial
resolution that are relevant when considering the spatial resolution of astronaut
photography.

2.1. Ground resolved distance

Photogrammetrists were measuring spatial resolution of aerial photographs using
empirical methods long before the ﬁrst scanning sensor was placed in orbit. These
methods integrated properties of the imaging system with the other external factors
that determine spatial resolution. Ground resolved distance (GRD) is the parameter
of most interest, because it measures the applicability of an image to a speciﬁc task.
The GRD of an image is deﬁned as the dimensions of the smallest discernible object.
The GRD is a function of geometry (altitude, focal length of optics), equipment
(internal system spatial resolution of the camera or scanner) and also on reﬂectance
characteristics of the object compared to its surroundings (contrast).

Performance of a ﬁlm, ﬁlm and camera, or deployed aerial photography system
is measured empirically using standard targets that consist of blaek-and-white bars
of graduated widths and spacings (ﬁgure 6—9 in Slater et al. 1983). The area-weighted
average resolution (AWAR) in lp mm‘ 1 (line pairs mm‘ 1) at the ﬁlm plane is deter-
mined by measuring the smallest set of line pairs that can be discriminated on an
original ﬁlm negative or transparency. Line pairs are quoted because it is necessary
to discriminate between one object and another, to detect it and measure it.

Film resolVin g power (in lp mm‘ 1) is measured by manufacturers under standard
photographic conditions (Smith and Anson 1968, Eastman Kodak Company 1998)

"
"4","4406 J. A. Robinson et al.

at high contrast (objeet/baekground ratio 1000/1) and low contrast (objeet/baek-
ground ratio 1.6/1). Most terrestrial surfaces recorded from orbit are low contrast,
for the purpose of estimating resolving power of ﬁlm. Kodak no longer measures
ﬁlm resolving power for non-aerial photographic ﬁlms (Karen Teitelbaum, Eastman
Kodak Company, personal communication), including ﬁlms that NASA routinely
uses for Earth photography.

AWAR can be measured for the static ease of ﬁlm and camera, or for the
eamera—aireraft system in motion. For example, AWAR for the National Aerial
Photography Program includes effects of the lens, resolving power of original ﬁlm,
image blur due to aircraft motion, and spatial resolution of duplicating ﬁlm (Light
1996). Given AWAR for a system in motion, the GRD can be calculated by
trigonometry (see equation (3) in §5, d=1/AWAR and D=GRD).

An impediment to similar rigorous measurement of GRD for orbital remote
sensing systems is the lack of a target of suitable scale on the ground; thus, spatial
resolution for most orbiting sensors is described in terms of a less all-eneompassin g
measure, instantaneous ﬁeld of View (see below). Additional challenges to measuring
AWAR for a complete astronaut photography system include the number of different
options for aspects of the system including different cameras, ﬁlms, and orbital
altitudes. These elements that must be standardized to determine AWAR provide
a useful list of those characteristics of astronaut photography that will most
inﬂuence GRD.

2.2. Instantaneous ﬁeld of view

The instantaneous ﬁeld of View (IFOV) is generally used to represent the spatial
resolution of automated satellite systems, and is commonly used interchangeably
with the term spatial resolution when eomparin g different sensors. IFOV is a combina-
tion of geometric, mechanical and electronic properties of the imaging system.
Geometric properties including satellite orbital altitude, detector size, and the focal
length of the optical system (Simonett 1983). The sensitivity of each detector element
at the wavelength desired plus the signal-to-noise level desired are electronic proper-
ties that determine a minimum time for energy absorption. For a linear sensor array
(pushbroom scanning), this minimum time is translated to areal coverage by the
forward velocity of the platform (Campbell 1996, p. 97). Usually, each detector
element in the array corresponds to a pixel in the image. Thus for a given altitude,
the width of the pixel is determined by the optics and sensor size, and the height of
the pixel is determined by the rate of forward motion. When magniﬁed by the ratio
of the sensor altitude t0 the focal length of the optics of the sensor system, IFOV is
the size of the area on the ground represented by an individual detector element
(pixel, Slater 1980, p. 27).

The equation of IFOV with spatial resolution can be misleading because IFOV
does not include factors other than geometry—faetors that largely determine the
level of detail that can be distinguished in an image. For example, IFOV does not
include characteristics of the target (contrast with surroundings, shape of an object,
colour), atmospheric conditions, illumination, and characteristics of the interpreter
(machine or human). Factors inﬂuencing spatial resolution that are included in IFOV
can be calculated from design speciﬁcations before the system has been built, whereas
the actual spatial resolution of an image captured by the sensor will be unique to
that image. IFOV represents the best spatial resolution possible given optimal
conditions.

2.3. Imagery from scanners versus ﬁlm from cameras

Like aerial photography systems, the GRD of early remote sensing scanners
(electro-optieal imaging systems), was calibrated empirically (ﬁgures 1—6 in Simonett
1983) but such methods are impractical for routine applications. Satellites are now
common platforms for collecting remote sensing data, small-seale aerial photographs
are widely available within the USA and Europe, and astronaut photographs
have become available worldwide. Straightforward comparison of resolutions of
photographs to IFOVs of scanner images is necessary for many applications.

How can spatial resolutions of data from different sources be compared using
common units? Oft-quoted ‘resolution numbers’, actually IFOV, of digital scanning
systems should be at least doubled for comparison to the standard method of
expressing photographic spatial resolution as GRD, simply because of the object
contrast requirement. The following rule of thumb has been used in geographic
applications to compare spatial resolution of scanners and aerial photography (Weleh
1982, Jensen 1983): a low-eontrast target may be converted to an approximate IFOV
by dividing the GRD (of the photograph) by 2.4. Such a rule of thumb might also
be reasonably applied to astronaut photography, making it possible to convert
observed GRD to IFOV, and IFOV to an estimated GRD.

In this paper, we discuss the spatial resolution of astronaut photographs in terms
of system properties and compute the area on the ground represented by a single
pixel, the equivalent to IFOV. To complete our treatment of spatial resolution, we
also provide estimates of the sizes of small features identiﬁable in images, for several
cases where this can be readily done.

3. Factors that determine the footprint (area covered by the photograph)

The most fundamental metric that forms the basis for estimatin g spatial resolution
of astronaut photographs is the size of the footprint, or area on the ground captured
in a photograph (see reView of satellite photogrammetry by Light 1980). The basic
geometric variables that inﬂuence the area covered by an astronaut photograph are
(1) the altitude of the orbit, H, (2) the focal length of the lens, f , (3) the actual size
of the image on the ﬁlm, d, and (4) the orientation of the camera aXis relative to the
ground (the obliquity or look angle, t). The relationships among these parameters
are illustrated in ﬁgure 1 (also see equation (3) in §5).

3.1. Altitude

Human spaceﬂight missions have had a variety of primary obj eetives that required
different orbital altitudes. The higher the altitude, the larger the footprint of the
photographs. The differing scale of photographs taken at different altitudes is illus-
trated in ﬁgure 2. The two photographs of Lake Eyre, Australia were taken with the
same camera and lens, but on different dates and from different altitudes. In (a), the
lake is relatively ﬂooded, while in (b) it is dry. A 2.3 x difference in altitude leads to
a eorrespondin g difference in the scales of the resulting photographs.

3.2. Lenses

The longer the lens focal length, the more magniﬁcation, the greater detail, and
the smaller footprint. A variety of lenses with different focal lengths are ﬂown on
each space mission (table 1). The effect of lens length on spatial coverage and image
detail is shown in ﬁgure 3. In these Views of Houston (a)—(c), taken from approxi-
mately similar altitudes with the same camera, most of the difference in scale of the

photographs is due to the diﬁerent magniﬁcations of the lenses. Although taken from
a different altitude and using a different camera With a diﬂerent original image size
(see table 2), an electronic still camera image taken With a 300mm lens is also
included for comparison.

For remote sensing, longer focal length lenses are generally preferred (250mm or
350mm for Hasselblad; 300mm or 400mm lenses for 35mm format cameras and
ESCs). Unfortunately, longer-focal-length lenses exhibit poorer performance toward
the edge of a frame. For example, a 250mm 1ens (Distagon CF 5.6) used on the
Hasselblad camera has spatial resolution of 571p mm‘“L at the centre, but only
511p mm‘ 1 at the edge and 461p mm‘ 1 at the corner (tested With Ektachrome 5017,
f/8 aperture and high contrast). A longer 300mm 1ens used on the Nikon camera
has a greater spatial resolution diﬁerence between centre (821p mm‘ 1) and corner
(491p mm‘ 1), using Kodak 5017 Ektachrome, f/4 aperture and high contrast, Fred
Pearce (unpublished data). There are tradeoffs among 1ens optics and speed. For
example, the lenses for the Linhof system, and the 250 mm lens for the Hasselblad
(Distagon CF 5.6, see footnotes to table 1) are limited to apertures smaller than
f /5.6. This becomes an important constraint in selecting shutter speeds (see discussion
of shutter speed in §4.2).

3.3. Cameras and actual image sizes

After passing through the lens, the photographic image is projected onto ﬁlm
inside the camera. The size of this original image is another important property
determining spatial resolution, and is determined by the camera used. Camera
formats include 35 mm and 70 mm (Lowman 1980, Amsbury 1989); and occasionally
5 x 4 inch (127 x 100mm) and larger (table 1). Cameras ﬂown on each mission are
not metric—they lack vacuum platens or reseau grids, image-motion compensation,
or gyro-stabilized mounts. The workhorse for engineering and Earth photography
on NASA missions has been a series of 70mm Hasselblad cameras (table 1), chosen
for their reliability. The modiﬁed magazine databack imprints a unique number and

9
were tested for Earth photography beginning in 1992 (Lulla and Holland 1993). In
an ESC, a CCD (charge-coupled device) is used as a digital replacement for ﬁlm
recording the image projected inside the camera. An ESC (consisting of a Kodak
DCS 4600 CCD in a Nikon N—9OS body) was added as routine equipment for
handheld photographs in 1995. ESCs have also been operated remotely to capture
and downlink Earth images through a NASA-sponsored educational programme
(EarthKAM). Discussion of CCD spatial array and radiometric sensitivity are
beyond the scope of this paper, but are summarized by Robinson et al. (2000b). The

"
"10","4412 J. A. Robinson et al.

format of the ﬁlm (or CCD) and image size projected onto the ﬁlm (or CCD) are
summarized for all the different cameras ﬂown in table 2.

3.4. Look angle or obliquity

No handheld photographs can be considered perfectly nadir; they are taken at a
variety of look angles ranging from near vertical (looking down at approximately
the nadir position of the spacecraft) to high oblique (images that include the curvature
of Earth). Imaging at oblique look angles leads to an image where scale degrades
away from nadir. A set of Views of the same area from different look angles is shown
in ﬁgure 4. The ﬁrst two shots of the island of Hawaii were taken only a few seconds
apart, and with the same lens. The third photograph was taken on a subsequent
orbit and with a shorter lens. The curvature of the Earth can be seen in the upper
left corner.

Obliquity can be described qualitatively (ﬁgure 4) or quantitatively as the look
angle (t, ﬁgure 1, calculations described in formulation 2 (§5.2)). Because obliquity
and look angle have such a dramatic inﬂuence on the footprint, we summarize the
database characteristics relative to these two parameters. Figure 5 is a breakdown
of the spatial resolution characteristics of low oblique and near vertical photographs
in the NASA Astronaut Photography database. Number of photographs are grouped
(1) by calculated values for look angle (t) and (2) by altitude. After obserVing the
overlap between near vertical and low oblique classes, we are currently restructurin g
this variable (‘tilt’) in the database to provide a measure of t when available. Users
will still be able to do searches based on the qualitative measures, but these measures
will be more closely tied to actual look angle.

3.4.1. Obliquity and georeferencing digitised photographs

Often the ﬁrst step in a remote sensing analysis of a digitized astronaut photo-
graph is to georeferenee the data and resample it to conform to a known map
projection. Details and recommendations for resampling astronaut photography
data are provided by Robinson et al. (2000a, 20000) and a tutorial is also available
(McRay et al. 2000). Slightly oblique photographs can be geometrically corrected
for remote sensing purposes, but extremely oblique photographs are not suited for
geometric correction. When obliquity is too great, the spatial scale far away from
nadir is much larger than the spatial scale closer to nadir; resampling results are
unsuitable because pixels near nadir are lost as the image is resampled while many
pixels far away from nadir are excessively replicated by resampling.

To avoid the generation of excess pixels during georefereneing, the pixel sizes of
the original digitized image should be smaller than the pixels in the ﬁnal resampled
image. Calculations of original pixel size using methods presented below can be
useful in ensuring meaningful resampling. For slightly oblique images, formulation 3
(§5.3) can be used to estimate pixel sizes at various locations in a photograph (near
nadir and away from nadir), and these pixel sizes then used to determine a reasonable
pixel scale following resampling.

4. Other characteristics that inﬂuence spatial resolution

Beyond basic geometry, many other factors internal to the astronaut photography
system impact the observed ground resolved distance in a photograph. The lenses
and cameras already discussed are imperfect and introduce radiometric degradations
(Moik 1980).Vignetting (slight darkening around the edges of an image) occurs in

Figure 4. Deﬁnitions of look angle for photographs taken from low orbit around Earth.
The example photographs of Hawaii were all taken from approximately the same
altitude (370—398km) and with the same (250mm) lens on a Hasselblad camera

astronaut photography due to light path properties of the lenses used. A lack of

ﬂatness of the ﬁlm at the moment of exposure (because cameras used in orbit do

not incorporate a vacuum platen) also introduces slight degradations. A number
of additional sources of image degradation that would affect GRD of astronaut
photographs are listed.

4.1. F ilms and processing

4.1.1. Colour reversalﬁlms

Most ﬁlms used in NASA handheld cameras in orbit have been E-6 process
colour reversal ﬁlms (Ektaehromes) that have a nominal speed of 64 to 100 ASA,
although many other ﬁlms have been ﬂown (table 3). Reversal ﬁlms are used because
damage from radiation exposure while outside the atmospheric protection of Earth
is more noticeable in negative ﬁlms than in positive ﬁlms (Slater 1996). The choice
of ASA has been to balance the coarser grains (lower ﬁlm resolving power) of high-
speed ﬁlms with the fact that slower ﬁlms require longer exposures and thus are
affected more by vehicle motion (approximately 7.3 km s‘ 1 relative to Earth’s surface
for the Space Shuttle). Extremely fast ﬁlms (> 400 ASA) are also more susceptible
to radiation damage in orbit (particularly during long-duration or high-altitude
missions, Slater 1996) and have not traditionally been used for Earth photography.

The manufacturer stock numbers identifying the ﬁlm used are available for each

image in the Astronaut Photography Database (Ofﬁce of Earth Sciences 2000).

4.1.2. Colour infrared ﬁlms

Colour infrared ﬁlm (CIR) was used during an Earth-orbiting Apollo mission
(Colwell 1971), in the multispectral S-190A and the high-resolution S-190B camera

systems on Skylab (NASA 1974, Wilmarth et al. 1977), and occasionally on Shuttle
missions and Shuttle-Mir missions (table 3). The CIR ﬁlm used is a three-layer
Aerochrome, having one layer that is sensitive to reﬂected solar infrared energy to
approximately 900 nm (Eastman Kodak Company 1998); protective coatings on
most spacecraft windows also limit IR transmittance between 800 mm and 1000 nm.
This layer is extremely sensitive to the temperature of the ﬁlm, which creates
unpredictable degradation of the IR signature under some spaceﬂight conditions.

4.1.3. Film duplication

The original ﬁlm is archived permanently after producing about 20 duplicate
printing masters (second generation). Duplicate printing masters are disseminated
to regional archives and used to produce products (third—fourth generation) for the
media, the public, and for scientiﬁc use. When prints, slides, transparencies, and
digital products are produced for public distribution, they are often colour adjusted
to correspond to a more realistic look. Digital products from second generation
copies can be requested by scientiﬁc users (contact the authors for information on
obtaining such products for a particular project), and these are recommended for
remote sensing applications. Care should be taken that the digital product acquired
for remote sensing analysis has not been colour adjusted for presentation purposes.
Based on qualitative observations, there is little Visible increase in GRD in the third
or fourth generation products. There is a signiﬁcant degradation in ﬁdelity of colour
in third and fourth generation duplicates, because an increase in contrast occurs
with every copy.

4.2. Shutter speeds

The impact of camera motion (both due to the photographer and t0 the motion
of the spacecraft) on image quality is determined by shutter speed—1/250 t0 1/500
second have been used, because slower speeds record obvious blurring caused by
the rapid motion of the spacecraft relative to the surface of the Earth. Generally
1/250 was used for ISO 64 ﬁlms (and slower), and after the switch to ISO 100 ﬁlms,
a 1/500 setting became standard. New Hasselblad cameras that have been ﬂown
beginnin g with STS-92 in October 2000 vary shutter speed using a focal plane shutter
for exposure bracketing (rather than varying aperture) and 1/250, 1/500 and 1/ 1000
second are used.

Across an altitude range of 120—300 nautical miles (222—555km) and orbital
inclinations of 28.50 and 57.00, the median relative ground velocity of orbiting
spacecraft is 7.3 km s‘ 1. At a nominal shutter speed of 1/500, the expected blur due
to motion relative to the ground would be 14.6 m. When cameras are handheld (as
opposed to mounted in a bracket), blur can be reduced by physical compensation
for the motion (tracking) by the photographer; many photographs show a level of
detail indicating that blur at this level did not occur (e.g. ﬁgure 3(d)). Thus, motion
relative to the ground is not an absolute barrier to ground resolution for handheld
photographs.

4.3. Spacecraft windows

Most of the photographs in the NASA Astronaut Photography Database were
taken through window ports on the spacecraft used. The transmittance of the window
port may be affected by material inhomogeniety 0f the glass, the number of layers
of panes, coatings used, the quality of the surface polish, environmentally induced
changes in window materials (pressure loads, thermal gradients), or deposited con-
tamination. Such degradation of the window cannot be corrected, is different for
each window, and changes over time. See Eppler et al. (1996) and Scott (2000) for
discussion of the spectral transmittance of the fused quartz window that is part of
the US Laboratory Module (Destiny) 0f the International Space Station.

4.4. Digitized images from ﬁlm

When ﬁlm is scanned digitally the amount of information retained depends on

the spectral information extracted from the ﬁlm at the spatial limits of the scanner.

"
"16","4418 J. A. Robinson et al.

To date, standard digitizing methodologies for astronaut photographs have not been
established and ﬁlm is digitized on a case-by-case basis using the equipment available.
4.4.1. Digitizing and spatial resolution

Light (1993, 1996) provided equations for determining the digitizing spatial
resolution needed to preserve spatial resolution of aerial photography based on the
static resolVin g power (AWAR) for the system. For ﬁlms where the manufacturer has
provided data (Eastman Kodak 1998, K. Teitelbaum, personal communication),
the resolving power of ﬁlms used for astronaut photography ranges from 32 lp mm‘ 1
to 1001p mm‘ 1 at low contrast (objeet/baekground ratio 1.6/1, table 3). The AWAR
for the static ease of the Hasselblad camera has been measured at high and low
contrast (using lenses shown in table 1), with a maximum of approximately
55 lp mm‘ 1 (Fred Pearce, unpublished data).

Based on the method of Light (1993, 1996), the dimension of one spatial resolution
element for a photograph with maximum static AWAR of 551p mm‘ 1 would be
18 ,umlp‘ 1. The acceptable range of spot size to preserve spatial information would
then be

18 ,um , 18 pm 1

2 \/5 <sean spot s1ze< 2 ( )
and 6um<sean spot size<9um. Similarly, for a more typical static AWAR of
301p mm‘ 1 (33 ,umlp‘ 1, low contrast, Fred Pearce, unpublished data) 11 um<scan
spot size< 17 pm. These scan spot sizes correspond to digitizing resolutions ranging
from 4233—2822 ppi (pixels ineh‘ 1) for AWAR of 55 lp mm‘ 1 and 2309—1494ppi for
AWAR of 301p mm‘ 1. Sean spot sizes calculated for astronaut photography are
comparable to those calculated for the National Aerial Photography Program
(9—13 um, Light 1996).

Widely available scanners that can digitize colour transparency ﬁlm currently
have a maXimum spatial resolution of approximately 2400 ppi (10.6 um pixel_ 1). For
example, we routinely use an Agfa Arcus II desktop scanner (see also BaltsaVias
1996) with 2400 ppi digitizing spatial resolution (2400 ppi optical resolution in one
direction, and 1200 ppi interpolated to 2400 ppi in the other direction) and 2400 ppi
was used to calculate IFOV equivalents (tables 2 and 4). For some combinations of
lens, camera, and contrast, 2400 ppi will capture nearly all of the spatial information
contained in the ﬁlm. However, for ﬁlm with higher resolving power than
Ektaehrome-64, for better lenses, and for higher contrast targets, digitizing at 2400 ppi
will not capture all of the spatial information in the ﬁlm.

Improvements in digitizing technology will only produce real increases in IFOV
to the limit of the AWAR of the photography system. The incremental increase in
spatial information above 3000 ppi (8.5 pm pixel_ 1) is not likely to outweigh the
costs of storing large images (Luman et al. 1997). At 2400 ppi, a Hasselblad frame
is approximately 5200>< 5200 or 27 million pixels (table 2) while the same image
digitized at 4000 ppi would contain 75 million pixels.

Initial studies using astronaut photographs digitized at 2400 ppi (10.6 um pixel_ 1,
Webb et al. 2000, Robinson et al. 20000) indicate that some GRD is lost compared
to photographic products. Nevertheless, the spatial resolution is still comparable
with other widely used data sources (Webb et al. 2000). Robinson et al. (20000)
found that digitizing at 21 um pixel‘ 1 provided information equivalent to 10.6 um
pixel‘ 1 for identifying general urban area boundaries for siX cities, except for a single

"
"17","Astronaut photograph y as digital data for remote sensing 4419
photo that required higher spatial resolution digitizing (it had been taken with a
shorter lens and thus had less spatial resolution). Part of the equivalence observed
in the urban areas study may be attributable to the fact that the ﬂatbed scanner
used interpolates from 1200 ppi to 2400 ppi in one direction. The appropriate digitiz-
ing spatial resolution will, in part, depend on the scale of features of interest to the
researchers, with a maximum upper limit set of a scan spot size of approximately
6 gm (4233 ppi).
4.4.2. Digitizing and spectral resolution

When colour ﬁlm is digitized, there will be loss of spectral resolution. The three
ﬁlm emulsion layers (red, green, blue) have relatively distinct spectral responses, but
are fused together so that digitizers detect one colour signal and must convert it
back into three (red, green, blue) digital channels. Digital scanning is also subject to
spectral calibration and reproduction errors. Studies using digital astronaut photo-
graphs to date have used 8 bits per channel. However, this is another parameter
that can be controlled when the ﬁlm is digitized. We do not further address spectral
resolution of digitally scanned images in this paper.

4.5. External factors that inﬂuence GRD

Although not discussed in detail in this paper, factors external to the spacecraft
and camera system (as listed by Moik (1980) for remote sensing in general) also
impact GRD. These include atmospheric interference (due to scattering, attenuation,
haze), variable surface illumination (differences in terrain slope and orientation), and
change of terrain reﬂectance with Viewing angle (bidirectional reﬂectance). For astro-
naut photographs, variable illumination is particularly important because orbits are
not sun-synehronous. Photographs are illuminated by different sun angles and images
of a given location will have colour intensities that vary widely. In addition, the
Viewing angle has an effect on the degree of object—to-baekground contrast and
atmospheric interference.

5. Estimating spatial resolution of astronaut photographs

In order to use astronaut photographs for digital remote sensing, it is important
to be able to calculate the equivalent to an IFOV—the ground area represented by
a single pixel in a digitized orbital photograph. The obliquity of most photographs
means that pixel ‘sizes’ vary at different places in an image. Given a ground distance,
D represented by a photograph in each direction (horizontal, vertical) an approxi-
mate average pixel width (P, the equivalent of IFOV) for the entire image can be
calculated as follows:

P D 2

— d S ( )

where D is the projected distance on the ground covered by the image in the same

direction as the pixel is measured, d is the actual width of the image on the original
ﬁlm (table 1), and S is the digitizing spatial resolution.

Here, we present three mathematical formulations for estimating the size of the
footprint, or area on the ground covered by the image. Example results from the
application of all three formulations are given in table 5. The ﬁrst and simplest
calculation (formulation 1) gives an idea of the maximum spatial resolution attainable
at a given altitude of orbit with a given ﬁlm format and a perfectly vertical (nadir)

"
"18","4420 J. A. Robinson et al.

View downward. Formulation 2 takes into account obliquity by calculating look
angle from the difference between the location on the ground represented at the
centre of the photograph, and the nadir location of the spacecraft at the time the
photograph was taken (ﬁgure 1). Formulation 3 describes an alternate solution to
the oblique look angle problem using eoordinate-system transformations. This
formulation has been implemented in a documented spreadsheet and is available
for download (http://eol.jse.nasa.gov/sseop/FootprintCaleulator.Xls), and is in the
process of being implemented on a Web-based user interface to the Astronaut
Photography Database (Ofﬁce of Earth Sciences 2000).

Although formulations 2 and 3 account for obliquity, for the purposes of calcula-
tion they treat the position of the spacecraft and position of the camera as one. In
actuality, astronauts are generally holding the cameras by hand (although cameras
bracketed in the window are also used), and the selection of window, position of the
astronaut in the window, and rotation of the camera relative to the movement of
the spacecraft are not known. Thus, calculations using only the photo centre point
(PC) and spacecraft nadir point (SN) give a locator ellipse and not the locations of
the corners of the photograph. A locator ellipse describes an estimated area on the
ground that is likely to be included in a speciﬁc photograph regardless of the rotation
of the ﬁlm plane about the camera’s optical aXis (ﬁgure 6).

Estimating the corner positions of the photo requires additional user input of a
single auxiliary point—a location on the image that has a known location on the
ground. Addition of this auxiliary point is an option available to users of the
spreadsheet. An example of the results of adding an auxiliary point is shown in
ﬁgure 7 with comparisons of the various calculations in table 5.

Figure 7. An example of the application of the Low Oblique Space Photo Footprint
Calculator. The photograph (STSO93-704—50) 0f Limmen Bight, Australia, was taken

length of lens, and H =a1titude. Once D is known, pixel size (length=width) can be
calculated from equation (2). These calculations represent the minimum footprint
and minimum pixel size possible for a given camera system, altitude and digitising
spatial resolution (table 2). Formulation 1 was used for calculating minimum pixel
sizes shown in tables 2 and 4.

By assuming digitizing at 2400 ppi (10.6 um pixel_ 1), currently a spatial resolution
commonly attainable from multipurpose colour transparency scanners (see §4.4.1),
this formulation was used to convert area covered to an IFOV equivalent for missions
of different altitudes (table 2). Table 4 provides a comparison of IFOV of images
from various satellites, including the equivalent for astronaut photography. Values
in this table were derived by using formulation 1 to estimate the area covered because
a perfect nadir View represents the best possible spatial resolution and smallest ﬁeld
of View that could be obtained.

calculated trigonometrically by assuming a spherical earth and calculating the dis-

tance between the coordinates of SN and PC (ﬁgure 1) using the Great Circle

5.3. Formulation 3. The Low Oblique Space Photo Footprint Calculator

The Low Oblique Space Photo Footprint Calculator was developed to provide
a more accurate estimation of the geographic coordinates for the footprint of a low
oblique photo of the Earth’s surface taken from a human-occupied spacecraft in
orbit. The calculator performs a series of three-dimensional coordinate transforma-
tions to compute the location and orientation of the centre of the photo exposure
plane relative to an earth referenced coordinate system. The nominal camera focal
length is then used to create a vector from the photo’s perspective point, through
each of eight points around the parameter of the image, as deﬁned by the format
size. The geographical coordinates for the photo footprint are then computed by
intersectin g these photo vectors with a spherical earth model. Although more sophist-
icated projection algorithms are available, no signiﬁcant increase in the accuracy of
the results would be produced by these algorithms due to inherent uncertainties in
the available input data (i.e. the spacecraft altitude, photo centre location, etc.).

The calculations were initially implemented within a Microsoft Excel workbook,
which allowed one to embed the mathematical and graphical documentation next
to the actual calculations. Thus, interested users can inspect the mathematical pro-
cessing. A set of error traps was also built into the calculations to detect erroneous
results. A summary of any errors generated is reported to the user with the results
of the calculations. Interested individuals are invited to download the Excel work-
book from http://eol.jsc.nasa.gov/sseop/FootprintCalculator.Xls. The calculations are
currently being encoded in a high-level programmin g language and should soon be
available alongside other background data provided for each photograph at Ofﬁce
of Earth Sciences (2000).

For the purposes of these calculations, a low oblique photograph was deﬁned as
one with the centre within 10 degrees of latitude and longitude of the spacecraft
nadir point. For the typical range of spacecraft altitudes to date, this restricted the
calculations to photographs in which Earth’s horizon does not appear (the general
deﬁnition of a low oblique photograph, e.g. Campbell 1996171, and ﬁgure 4).

5.3.1. Input data and results

Upon opening the Excel workbook, the user is presented with a program intro-
duction providing instructions for using the calculator. The second worksheet tab
‘How-To-Use’, provides detailed step-by-step instructions for preparin g the baseline
data for the program. The third tab ‘Input-Output’ contains the user input ﬁelds
and displays the results of the calculations. The additional worksheets contain the
actual calculations and program documentation. Although users are welcome to
reView these sheets, an experienced user need only access the ‘Input-Output’
spreadsheet.

To begin a calculation the user enters the following information which is available
for each photo in the NASA Astronaut Photography Database: (1) SN, geographical
coordinates of spacecraft nadir position at the time of photo; (2) H, spacecraft
altitude; (3) PC, the geographical coordinates of the centre of the photo; (4) f ,
nominal focal length; and (5) d, image format size. The automatic implementation
of the workbook on the web will automatically enter these values and complete
calculations.

For more accurate results the user may optionally enter the geographic co-
ordinates and orientation for an auXiliary point on the photo, which resolves the
camera’s rotation uncertainty about the optical aXis. The auXiliary point data must

"
"23","Astronaut photograph y as digital data for remote sensing 4425
be computed by the user following the instruction contained in the ‘How-To-Use’
tab of the spreadsheet.

After entering the input data the geographic coordinates of the photo footprint
(i.e. four photo corner points, four points at the biseetor of each edge and the centre
of the photo) are immediately displayed below the input ﬁelds along with any error
messages generated by the user input or by the calculations (ﬁgure 7). Although
results are computed and displayed, they should not be used when error messages
are produced by the program. The program also computes the tilt angle for each of
the photo vectors relative to the spacecraft nadir vector. T0 the right of the photo
footprint coordinates is displayed the are distance along the surface of the sphere
between adjacent computed points.

5.3.2. Calculation assumptions

The mathematical calculations implemented in the Low Oblique Space Photo
Footprint Calculator use the following assumptions:

1. The SN location is used as exact, even though the true value may vary by up

to i 0.1 degree from the location provided with the photo.

2. The spacecraft altitude is used as exact. Although the determination of the
nadir point at the instant of a known spacecraft vector is relatively precise
(i 1.15 x 10— 4 degrees), the propagator interpolates between sets of approxi-
mately 10—40 known vectors per day, and the time code recorded on the ﬁlm
can drift. Thus, the true value for SN may vary by up to $0.1 degree from
the value provided with the photo.

3. The perspective centre of the camera is assumed to be at the given altitude
over the speciﬁed spacecraft nadir location at the time of photo exposure.

4. The PC location is used as exact, even though the true value may vary by up
to $0.50 latitude and $0.50 longitude from the location provided with the
photo.

5. A spherical earth model is used with a nominal radius of 6372161.54m (a
common ﬁrst-order approximation for a spherical earth used in geodetic
computations).

6. The nominal lens focal length of the camera lens is used in the computations
(calibrated focal length values are not available).

7. The photo projection is based on the classic pin-hole camera model.

8. N0 correction for lens distortion or atmospheric reﬂection is made.

9. If no auXiliary point data is provided, the ‘Top of the Image’ is oriented
perpendicular to the vector from SN towards PC.

5.3.3. Transformation from Earth to photo coordinate systems

The calculations begin by converting the geographic coordinates (latitude and
longitude) of the SN and PC to a Rectangular Earth-Centred Coordinate System
(R-Earth), deﬁned as shown in ﬁgure 9 (with the centre of the Earth at (O, O, 0)).
Using the vector from the Earth’s centre through SN and the spacecraft altitude, the
spacecraft location (SC) is also computed in R-Earth.

For ease of computation, a Rectangular Spacecraft-Centred Coordinate System
(R-Spaeeeraft) is deﬁned as shown in ﬁgure 9. The origin of R-Spaeeeraft is located
at SC, with its +Z-aXis aligned with vector from the centre of the Earth through
SN and its +X—aXis aligned with the vector from SN to PC (ﬁgure 9). The speciﬁc

rotations and translation used to convert from the R-Earth t0 the R-Spacecraft are
computed and documented in the spreadsheet.

With the mathematical positions of the SC, SN, PC, and the centre of the Earth
computed in R-Spacecraft, the program next computes the location of the camera’s
principal point (PP). The principle point is the point of intersection of the optical
axis of the lens With the image plane (i.e. the ﬁlm). It is nominally positioned at a

"
"25","Astronaut photograph y as digital data for remote sensing 4427
distance equal to the focal length from the perspective centre of the camera (which
is assumed to be at SC) along the vector from PC through SC, as shown in ﬁgure 9.

A third coordinate system, the Rectangular Photo Coordinate System (R-Photo)
is created with its origin at PP, its X—Y aXial plane normal to the vector from PC
through SC and its +X aXis aligned with the +X aXis of R-Spacecraft, as shown
in ﬁgure 9. The X—Y plane of this coordinate system represents the image plane of
the photograph.

5.3.4. Auxiliary point calculations

The calculations above employ a critical assumption that all photos are taken
with the ‘top of the image’ oriented perpendicular to the vector from the SN towards
PC, as shown in ﬁgure 9. To avoid non-uniform solar heating of the external surface,
most orbiting spacecraft are slowly and continually rotated about one or more axes.
In this condition a ﬂight crew member taking a photo while ﬂoating in microgravity
could orient the photo with practically any orientation relative to the horizon (see
also ﬁgure 8(b)). Unfortunately, since these photos are taken with conventional
handheld cameras there is no other information available which can be used to
resolve the photo’s rotational ambiguity about the optical axis, other then the photo
itself. This is why the above assumption is used and the footprint computed by this
calculator is actually a ‘locator ellipse’, which estimates the area on the ground what
is likely to be included in a speciﬁc photograph (see ﬁgure 6). This locator ellipse is
most accurate for square image formats and subject to additional distortion as the
photograph format becomes more rectangular.

If the user wants a more precise calculation of the image footprint, the photo’s
rotational ambiguity about the optical aXis must be resolved. This can be done in
the calculator by adding data for an auXiliary point. Detailed instructions regarding
how to prepare and use auXiliary point data in the computations are included in the
‘How-To-Use’ tab of the spreadsheet. Basically, the user determines which side of
the photograph is top, and then measures the angle between the line from PP to the
top of the photo and from PP to the auXiliary point on the photo (ﬁgure 9).

If the user includes data for an auXiliary point, a series of computations are
completed to resolve the photo rotation ambiguity about the optical aXis (i.e. the
+Z aXis in R-Photo). A vector from the Auxiliary Point on the Earth (AE) through
the photograph perspective centre (located at SC) is intersected with the photo image
plane (X—Y plane of R-Photo) to compute the coordinates of the Auxiliary Point on
the photo (AP) in R-Photo. A two-dimensional angle in the X—Y plane of R-Photo,
from the —X aXis to a line from PP to AP is calculated, as shown in ﬁgure 9. The
—X aXis is used as the origin of the angle since it represents the top of the photo
once it passes through the perspective centre. The difference between the computed
angle and the angle measured by the user on the photo resolves the ambiguity in
the rotation of the photo relative to the principal line (ﬁgures 7 and 9). The
transformations from R-Spacecraft and R-Photo are then modiﬁed to include an
additional rotation angle about the +Z aXis in R-Photo.

5.3.5. ‘Footprint’ calculations

The program next computes the coordinates of eight points about the perimeter
of the image format (i.e. located at the four photo corners, plus a bisector point
along each edge of the image). These points are identiﬁed in R-Photo based upon
the photograph format size and then converted to R-Spacecraft. Since all computa-
tions are done in orthogonal coordinate systems, the R-Spacecraft to R-Photo

"
"26","4428 J. A. Robinson et al.

rotation matrix is transposed to produce an R-Photo to R-Spaeeeraft rotation matrix.
Once in R-Spaeeeraft, a unit vector from each of the eight perimeter points, through
the photo perspective centre (the same point as SC), is computed. This provides the
coordinates for points about the perimeter of the image format, with their direction
vectors in a common coordinate system with other key points needed to compute
the photo footprint.

The next step is to compute the point of intersection between the spherical earth
model and each of the eight perimeter point vectors. The scalar value for each
perimeter point unit vector is computed using two-dimensional planar trigonometry.
An angle )2 is computed using the formula for the cosine of an angle between two
included vectors (the perimeter point unit vector and the vector from SC to the
centre of the Earth). Angle w is computed using the Law of Sines. Angle 8:180
degrees—y—w. The scalar value of the perimeter point vector is computed using a
and the Law of Cosines. The scalar value is then multiplied by the perimeter point
unit vector to produce the three-dimensional point of intersection of the vector with
Earth’s surface in R-Spaeeeraft. The process is repeated independently for each of
the eight perimeter point vectors. Aside from its mathematical simplicity, the value
of aresine (computed in step 2) will exceed the normal range for the sin of an angle
when the perimeter point vectors fail to intersect with the surface of the earth. A
simple test, based on this principle, allows the program to correctly handle oblique
photos which image a portion of the horizon (see results for high oblique photographs
in table 5).

The ﬁnal step in the process converts the eight earth intersection points from the
R-Spaeeeraft to R-Earth. The results are then converted to the standard geographic
coordinate system and displayed on the ‘Input-Output’ page of the spreadsheet.
5.4. Examples

All three formulations were applied to the photographs included in this paper
and the results are compared in table 5. Formulation 1 gives too small a value for
distance across the photograph (D) for all but the most nadir shots, and thus serves
as an indicator of the best theoretical case, but is not a good measure for a speciﬁc
photograph. For example, the photograph of Lake Eyre taken from 276 km altitude
(ﬁgure 2(a)) and the photograph of Limmen Bight (ﬁgure 7), were closest to being
nadir Views (offsets < 68 km or t<150, table 5). For these photographs, D calculated
using Formulation 1 was similar to the minimum D calculated using Formulations
2 and 3. For almost all other more oblique photographs, Formulation 1 gave a
signiﬁcant underestimate of the distance covered in the photograph. For ﬁgure S(A)
(the picture of Houston taken with a 40 mm lens), Formulation 1 did not give an
underestimate for D. This is because Formulation 1 does not account for curvature
of the Earth in any way. With this large ﬁeld of View, assuming a ﬂat Earth inﬂated
the value of D above the minimum from calculations that included Earth curvature.

A major difference between Formulations 2 and 3 is the ability to estimate pixel
sizes (P) in both directions (along the principal line and perpendicular to the principal
line). For the more oblique photographs, the vertical estimate of D and pixel sizes is
much larger than in the horizontal direction (e.g. the low oblique and high oblique
photographs of Hawaii, ﬁgure 4, table 5).

For the area of Limmen Bight (ﬁgure 7), table 5 illustrates the improvement in
the estimate of distance and pixel size that can be obtained by re-estimating the
location of the PC with greater accuracy. Centre points in the catalogued data are

$050 of latitude and longitude. When the centre point was re-estimated to i 0.020,
we determined that the photograph was not taken as obliquely as ﬁrst thought
(change in the estimate of the look angle t from 16.9 to 12.80, table 5). When the
auxiliary point was added to the calculations of Formula 3, the calculated look angle
shrank further to 11.00, indicating that this photograph was taken at very close to
a nadir View. Of course, this improvement in accuracy could have also led to estimates
of greater obliquity, and eorrespondin g larger pixel sizes.

We also tested the performance of the scale calculator with auxiliary point by
estimating the corner and point locations on the photograph using a 111000 000
Operational Navigational Chart. For this test, we estimated our ability to read
coordinates from the map as i0.02Oand our error in ﬁnding the locations of the
corner points as $0.150 (this error varies among photographs depending on the
detail that can be matched between photo and map). For Limmen Bight (ﬁgure 7),
the mean difference between map estimates and calculator estimates for four points
was 0.310 (SD=O.18, n28). For a photograph of San Francisco Bay (STSOé2-
151-291) the mean difference between map estimates and calculator estimates for
four points was 0.0640 (SD=O.18, n28). For a photograph of San Francisco Bay
(STSOé2-151-29 1) the mean difference between map estimates and calculator estim-
ates for eight points was 0.1960 (SD 20.146, n: 16). Thus in one case, the calculator
estimates were better than our estimate of the error in locating corner points on the
map. It is reasonable to expect that for nadir-Viewing photographs, the calculator
used with an auxiliary point can estimate locations of the edges of a photograph to
within $0.30.

5.5. Empirical conﬁrmation of spatial resolution estimates

As stated previously, a challenge to estimating system-AWAR for astronaut
photography of Earth is the lack of suitable targets. Small features in an image can
sometimes be used as a check on the size of objects that can be successfully resolved,
giving an approximate value for GRD. Similarly, the number of pixels that make up
those features in the digitized image can be used to make an independent calculation
of pixel size. We have successfully used features such as roads and airport runways
to make estimates of spatial scale and resolution (e.g. Robinson et al. 20000). While
recognizing that the use of linear detail in an image is a poor approximation to a
bar target, and that linear objects smaller than the resolving power can often be
detected (Charman 1965), few objects other than roads could be found to make any
direct estimates of GRD. Thus, roads and runways were used in the images of
Houston (where one can readily conduct ground veriﬁcations, and where a number
of higher—eontrast concrete roadways were available), to obtain empirical estimates
of GRD and pixel size for comparison with table 5.

In the all-digital ESC image of Houston (ﬁgure 3(d)) we examined Ellington
Field runway 4-22 (centre left of the image) which is 2438.4m x 45.7 m. This runway
is approximately 6—7 pixels in width and 304—3094 pixels in length, so pixels
represent an distance on the ground 7—8m. Using a lower contrast measure of a
street length between two intersections (212.5 m = 21.1 pixels), a pixel width of 10.1 m
is estimated. These results compare favourably with the minimum estimate of 8.1 m
pixels using Formulation 1 (table 5). For an estimate of GRD that would be more
comparable to aerial photography of a line target, the smallest street without tree
cover that could be clearly distinguished on the photograph was 7.92m wide. The
smallest non-street object (a gap between stages of the Saturn rocket on display in

a park at Johnson Space Center) that could clearly be distinguished on the photo-
graph was 8.53 m wide.

For the photograph of Houston taken with a 250mm lens (ﬁgure 3(C)), and
digitized from second generation ﬁlm at 2400 ppi (10.6 ,um pixel_ 1), Ellington Field
runway 4-22 is 3 pixels in width and 161.3 pixels in length, so pixels represent
15.1—15.2m on the ground. These results compare favourably with the minimum
estimate of 15.2m using Formulation 2, and 15.4—18.5 m pixels using Formulation 3
(table 5). For an estimate of GRD using an 8 x 8 inch print (1:3.69 enlargement) and
4 x magniﬁcation, the smallest street that could clearly be distinguished was 8.22m
wide, the same feature could barely be distinguished on the digitized image.

We also made an empirical estimate of spatial resolution for lower contrast
vegetation boundaries. By clearing forest so that a pattern would be Visible to landin g
aircraft, a landowner outside Austin, Texas (see also aerial photo in Lisheron 2000),
created a target that is also useful for evaluating spatial resolution of astronaut
photographs. The forest was selectively cleared in order to spell the landowner’s
name ‘LUECKE’ with the remaining trees (ﬁgure 10). According to local surveyors
who planned the clearing, the plan was to create letters that were 3100 ft x 1700 ft
(944.9 m x 518.2 m). Photographed at a high altitude relative to most Shuttle missions
(543 km) with a 250mm lens, Formula 3 predicts that each pixel would represent an
area 28.6m>< 36.0m on the ground (table 5). When original ﬁlm was digitized at
2400 ppi (10.6 um pixel_ 1), letters correspond to 29.4 x 18.8 pixels for a comparable
pixel size of 27—32 m.

6. Summary and conclusions

Astronaut photographs can be an excellent source of data for remote sensing
applications. Best-ease resolutions are similar to that for Landsat or SPOT with
pixels as small as < 10m. It was estimated that of images taken to date, 50.4% had
lens and obliquity characteristics that make them potential candidates for remote
sensing information. Digitized astronaut photographs can be overlaid with other
satellite data using GIS (Eekardt et al. 2000), or used to ﬁll in gaps in time series
when other imagery is not available. As a source of publie-domain information, they
can be very useful for scientists who do not have access to satellite imagery either
because of the eXpense of image acquisition (to the end user), or the computer
systems needed for processin g satellite images. These differences in image acquisition
costs (to the user) are summarized in table 6.

Searching of the complete database of NASA astronaut photography, including
low-spatial-resolution browse images, is available Via the Web (Ofﬁce of Earth
Sciences 2000). This provides nearly global access for identifying images that will
contribute to a speciﬁc scientiﬁc project. For the most detailed studies, digital
products posted to the web will not be of suﬁieient quality. To date, we have made
it a practice of digitizing small numbers of images when requested by scientists at
no charge. Such requests (including a description of the project involved) can be
made through the authors or using the contact information listed on the website.
Investigators with needs for larger numbers of digital images have also been served
through collaborative agreements.

In our experience, scientists that ﬁnd the data most valuable are those in develop-
ing countries, those studying areas that have not usually been targets for the major
satellites, those haVing diﬁieulty in ﬁnding low-eloud images, those interested in
eonstruetin g time series, or those interested in using a large number of images.

"33","Astronaut photograph y as digital data for remote sensing 4435

Because use of astronaut photography data is unfamiliar to most scientists and
remote sensing experts, we have tried to provide a general synopsis of its major
characteristics. One common source of confusion about the data arises from its
variable spatial resolution. The issue of spatial resolution of astronaut photographs
has been treated to a level of detail that has not been previously published. In
addition, a primer of equations has been provided that can be used for calculating
spatial resolution of a given photograph, and user-friendly methods have been
incorporated for non-specialists to estimate spatial resolution of speciﬁc photographs

(using tools on our Web interface or by downloading a spreadsheet). Although more

variable than other types of satellite data, the information in the images can be

extracted using familiar remote sensing techniques such as georeferencing and image
classiﬁcation. This makes the data source valuable for remote sensing applications
in ecology and conservation biology, geography, geology and other related ﬁelds.

Acknowledgments

We thank the astronauts, cataloguers, and scientists whose efforts over the last

25 years have developed and preserved the remote sensing resource described in this
paper. Barbara Boland served as a primary beta-tester for the Photo Footprint
Calculator, and helped to improve its user interface. James Heydorn searched data-
