Abstract
The complex radiation ﬁeld inside the International Space Station (ISS) as well as the dose received by its crew was studied for several
years in the BRADOS (1—5) projects organized by the Institute for Biomedical Problems (IBMP, Moscow) with the participation of different
laboratories. The results of the measurements performed during the BRADOS—S project by a 3 axes solid state nuclear track detector (SSNTD)
stack as LET spectra and dose values are presented. According to the results, no remarkable directional dependence could be Observed in
the radiation ﬁeld. The averaged absorbed dose rate and dose equivalent rate values above ~ 12 keV 11111—1 were 27.0 :I: 1.611Gy d_1 and
211.4 :I: 14.4 HSV d_l, respectively, resulting in an averaged quality factor of 7.9 :I: 0.1.
