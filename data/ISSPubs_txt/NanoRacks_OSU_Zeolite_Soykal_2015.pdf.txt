Abstract: Cerium oxide (CeOz) was prepared using a eontrolled-preeipitation
method under microgravity at the International Space Station (188). For comparison,
eeria was also synthesized under normal-gravity conditions (referred as control).
The Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET) surface area, pore volume and pore size analysis
results indicated that the eeria particles grown in space had lower surface area and pore
volume compared to the control samples. Furthermore, the space samples had a broader
pore size distribution ranging from 30—600 A, whereas the control samples consisted of
pore sizes from 30—50 A range. Structural information of the eeria particles were obtained
using TEM and XRD. Based on the TEM images, it was conﬁrmed that the space samples
were predominantly nano-rods, 0n the other hand, only nano-polyhedra particles were seen
in the control eeria samples. The average particle size was larger for eeria samples
synthesized in space. XRD results showed higher erystallinity as well as larger mean
crystal size for the space samples. The effect of sodium hydroxide concentration 011
synthesis of eeria was also examined using 1 M and 3 M solutions. It was found that
the control samples, prepared in 1 M and 3 M sodium hydroxide solutions, did not show
a signiﬁcant difference between the two. However, when the eeria samples were prepared

in a more basic medium (3 M) under microgravity, a decrease in the particle size of
the nano-rods and appearances of nano-polyhedra and spheres were observed.

1. Introduction

Cerium oxide (CeOz) is a widely used catalyst support due to its high oxygen storage capacity and
high oxygen ion conductivity. The high oxygen mobility of eeria leads to a change in its oxidation
state between Ce3+ and Ge“, which facilitates its use as an oxygen buffer for catalytic redox
reactions [1,2]. In addition, eeria has been shown to have catalytic activity itself for various reactions,
such as oxidation and reforming [3,4]. Moreover, the high thermal stability of eeria is attractive for
reactions which are conducted at high temperatures [2]. Therefore, eeria has been extensively utilized
in three-way catalysts [5—7] and fuel cells [8,9], as well as investigated for its activity in catalytic
reactions such as CO oxidation [10,11], steam reforming [12—17], and water gas shift (WGS) [18,19].

A variety of methods to synthesize eeria have been reported until now, including precipitation [20],
spray pyrolysis [21,22], thermal hydrolysis [23], miero-emulsion [24], combustion [25],
sonochemieal [26], hydrothermal [27], solvothermal [28,29], and sol-gel [30] techniques. It is
a well-established fact that changing the synthesis parameters, such as temperature, pressure, pH, and
crystallization time, produces different particle sizes and morphologies, which, in turn, alter
the physical and chemical properties of eeria, as well as the catalytic performance of
the eeria-supported catalysts. For example, an increase in oxygen vacancies with decreased particle
size of eeria has been reported in many studies [31—33]. Deshpande et al. [32] obtained 17% to 44%
increase in Ce3+ concentration as eeria particles size was reduced from 30 nm to 3 nm, which was
prepared by micro-emulsion. This was attributed to the generation of oxygen vacancies 0f eeria [32].
Flytzani-Stephanopoulos and colleagues synthesized nano-polyhedra, rods and cubic eeria particles
using hydrolysis method and examined its catalytic activity for various reactions [19,34—37]. They
demonstrated that different shapes of eeria nanoparticles exposing different crystal planes on
the catalyst surface signiﬁcantly inﬂuenced the Au dispersion 0n the eeria support.

Although there are many studies about the eeria synthesis process, very little is understood
regarding the effect of microgravity 0n the characteristics of ceria. It is expected that gravitational
forces would affect the crystallization process and lead to different chemical properties of a solid
especially when it is prepared in a heterogeneous solution. This can be attributed to the gravity-driven
disturbance in the solution (convection), sedimentation 0f the solid phase, and the frequency of
collisions between particles during the reaction. In the literature, several microgravity studies have
been conducted on synthesis of zeolites [38—41]. Coker et al. [38] obtained larger average crystal
dimensions, less surface area of the Zeolite Soeony Mobil (ZSM)-5 under microgravity conditions.
The formation of larger crystals of ZSM-5 zeolite was explained by lack of convection and
sedimentation of zeolite particles during crystallization. Sano and coworkers [40] prepared ZSM-5
zeolite in space and observed signiﬁcantly better uniformity of shape and size. Tsuehida et al. calculated

"

the formation rates for colloidal crystallization of silica spheres. It was shown that rate constants were
signiﬁcantly smaller in microgravity [42]. Smith et a]. reported that formation of silica crystals to be
slower under microgravity environment due to diffusion-limited crystallization where mass transfer
dominates the aggregation of particles rather than reaction kinetics [43]. The effect of microgravity 0n
synthesis of mieroporous tin(IV) sulﬁdes was examined by Ahari and coworkers [44]. Their results
indicated a higher degree of crystallinity, as well as smoother crystal surface of the sample. Additionally,
the Langmuir isotherm showed 60% larger pore volume [44]. Similarly, a signiﬁcant reduction of
number of pores were reported from aluminum-eopper alloy by Fujii et a]. [45].

Previously, we have reported 011 synthesis of eeria with different morphologies (polyhedra, rods,
cubes) and different particle sizes (3 11111—25 11m). These materials were examined both as supports, as well
as catalysts, in ethanol steam reforming to understand the effect of particle size and morphology [3,46].
In this article, we report the effect of microgravity 0n the synthesis of eeria.

Ceria samples were synthesized using cerium nitrate and sodium hydroxide solutions. Solutions
with different concentrations were taken separately to the International Space Station and mixed under
microgravity. The samples were launched on 22 J anuary 2011, and the experiment was performed 011
21 February 2011. After staying at microgravity for 23 days, the samples were returned to Earth
and delivered to our laboratories. Similar synthesis experiments were also performed on Earth as
control experiments.

Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET) surface area, pore volume and pore size distribution were measured
using nitrogen physisorption technique for both sets of samples. Transmission electron microscopy
(TEM) images were taken to obtain particle size and shape. X-ray Diffraction (XRD) was also used to
determine crystallite size and exposed surface planes.

2. Results and Discussion
2.]. BET Surface Area, Pore Size and Pore Volume

BET surface analysis was conducted on the eeria samples to determine the effect of microgravity on
their surface characteristics. Table 1 compares the surface areas and pore volumes of the various
samples tested. The control samples exhibited higher surface area and higher pore volume than
the space samples. Regarding the effect of pH on the pore volume and surface area, higher surface
areas and pore volumes were observed with increase in basicity of the medium for space samples
whereas the opposite trend was exhibited by the control samples.

There was a considerable difference between control and space eeria in terms of the pore size

distribution, as observed in Figure 1. The control eeria had a narrower pore size distribution with most

"

of the pores being the 50—100 A range and 110 pores larger than ~200 A. On the other hand, for
the space samples, a wide range of pore diameters ranging from 30—600 A were observed. The lower
pore volume and surface area can be due to larger particles size of the space samples compared to
control samples. This was further conﬁrmed in the TEM section. With respect to the effect of NaOH
concentration, broader pore size distribution was obtained in case of 1 M control ceria than 3 M.
The highest pore volume was obtained at a pore diameter of 83 A and 62 A for 1 M and 3 M,
respectively. For space-grown eeria, there were no signiﬁcant changes in the pore size distribution.

TEM images were obtained to conﬁrm the eeria morphology and particle size (Figures 2 and 3).
The particle size measurement was done by random sampling using multiple mierographs.
Additionally, different batches of space and control samples are used for analysis.

In Figure 2a—e, TEM images of control eeria prepared with 1 M NaOH solution are shown. These
samples consisted of polyhedron-shaped particles with an average particle size of 3.8 nm, fairly
uniform particle size and shape throughout the sample. Similarly, control samples prepared at more basic
conditions (Figure 2d—1) contained smaller nanopolyhedra with an average particle size of 2.9 nm.

TEM images of the space samples are presented in Figure 3. The samples had mostly nano-rods,
with 2—13 mm in width and 10—50 mm in length. Samples prepared with 1 M-solution were seen to give

"

larger and more uniform particles on the average. The 3 M-space samples had some nano-spheres as
well as rods. The particle size distributions for all four ceria samples are shown in Figures 4 and 5.

These results are signiﬁcant in showing that ceria nanorods can be synthesized at room temperature
and atmospheric pressure. To the best of our knowledge, there have not been any publications for
the synthesis of nanorods under such conditions. In most cases, studies have concluded that ceria
nanorods are formed at much higher temperatures and pressures [27,46—49]. In order to understand
the formation of ceria nanorods under microgravitiy condition, two crystal growth processes, Oswald
ripening and oriented attachment, can be considered. These crystal growth mechanisms have been
utilized to demonstrate the increase in particle size and change in morphology of the ceria
particles [50—52]. The Ostwald ripening process follows the dissolution and reprecipitation of solution
ions (Ce4+, OH‘) from the ceria nuclei minimizing the surface energy state [53]. On the other hand,
the oriented attachment mechanism predominantly depends on the collision between nuclei during
reaction. This process allows ceria nano-crystal to grow into a certain direction [53]. Under microgravity
condition, the lack of sedimentation 0f ceria particles in the solution may increase the residence time
for nucleation of ceria crystals [40]. Additionally, the diffusion and/or natural convection 0f ceria
particles can be somewhat enhanced. These factors can signiﬁcantly affect the crystal growth through

"
"6","Catalysts 2015, 5 1311
oriented attachment, Which results in more frequent collision between nuclei, thus forming larger
particles and nanorods. There have been several articles showing evidence that oriented attachment
crystal growth is the main route for the formation of nanorods 0f ceria [51], as well as various metal
oxides [54].

In the literature, numerous studies on understanding the effect of pH on ceria particles size and
shape have been conducted, however, depending on the synthesis method and choice of ceria precursor,
different results have been reported. Tok et al. [50] observed similar behavior where smaller grains
were seen in a more basic environment. This was because the Ce(OH)4 precipitate is basic; thus, the
solubility of Ce(OH)4 in a more basic medium limits further agglomeration to form larger
particles [50]. However, an opposite trend was reported by Yang and coworkers [51], where changing
the concentration of NaOH from 1 M to 5 M, increased the particle size of the ceria cubes from 20 nm
to 25—40 nm. Mai 67 al. [52] prepared ceria using cerium nitrate precursor at different NaOH
concentrations of 1, 3, 6 and 9 M, at a ﬁxed reaction temperature of 100 CC and reaction time of 24 h.
It was observed that polyhedra particles were formed using 1 M NaOH, but as the solution became
more basic, only rods were obtained.

In this study, the effect of pH on the ceria morphology and particle size was more apparent in
the case of the space samples. It was found that the length of the nanorods were longer for
the 1 M-space samples whereas smaller dimensions were observed for the 3 M-space samples. Moreover,
the rods were prominent the former, while the number of rods were smaller in the 3 M-space samples,
with nano-polyhedra and spheres also being observed. It should also be noted that the control ceria
samples were under reaction condition of 25 CC and 1 atm. For example, Wu et al. [53] prepared ceria
powders in acidic, basic and neutral reaction mediums indicating that the effect of pH on particles size
was insigniﬁcant at room temperature. The similarities between the particles size and shape in
the 1 M and 3 M-control samples are in good agreement with their results. Therefore, it can be
concluded that under microgravity, the pH affects the ceria morphology and particle size, whereas
the effect is less prominent under normal gravity at room temperature.

Lastly, identiﬁcation of the diffracted planes were conducted. D-spacing was measured using

Image J software. Figure 5c shows a ceria rod including (220) and (200) planes with 0.19 and 0.27 nm

d-spacing [34,46,52]. Figure 5f indicates ceria nancpclyhedra and spheres with (311) and (220)

planes [54].

2.3. X-ray Diffraction (XRD) Analysis

The XRD patterns of the ceria samples are shown in Figure 6. A11 patterns exhibited ﬁve distinct
peaks which ensured that pure ceria was formed. Each peak was assigned to a particular crystal plane.
The peak at a 20 value of 285"", which showed the highest intensity, was identiﬁed as (111) plane of
the cubic cerianite phase (ICDD 81-792). Others at 20 values of 330, 47.50, 56°, and 69.40 were
identiﬁed as (200), (220), (311), and (400) planes of ceria. For comparison, sharper diffraction lines
were obtained for space samples, which suggest higher crystallinity of the structure.

The full width at half maximum (FWHM) values are shown in Figure 7. These values were used to
calculate the mean crystal size which is listed in Table 2. It appears that the (111) peak is broader for
control samples, resulting smaller crystal size than those that were prepared in space. Generally,
the crystal size estimated from XRD is in good agreement with the particle size observed in TEM. In
the control samples, however, an increase of crystal size from 31.6 to 39.6 A was obtained with
an increasing NaOH concentration, whereas almost no change in terms of particle size was concluded
from TEM results. In contrast, the effect of pH on the crystal size was clear for space samples, where
a signiﬁcant decrease of crystal size from 67.9 to 53.5 A was seen, which follows the same trend as
that of the TEM results.

Ceria nanoparticles were prepared by precipitation method, where 2.1 g Ce(NO3)3'6HzO
(Sigma-Aldrich, 99.999%, St. Louis, MO, USA) was dissolved in 13.5 mL water. 111 separate
containers, caustic solutions with 66.5 mL of 1 M and 3 M NaOH were prepared. The solutions were
loaded into concentric cylindrical rods. The innermost tube contained the cerium nitrate solution.

Surrounding the inner glass tube was the sodium hydroxide solution. The astronauts were instructed to
bend the assembly and thereby break the innermost glass tubing, allowing the solutions to mix.
The assembly was then shaken to allow for a more thorough mixing. It should be noted that the liquid

Figure 9. Schematic for the catalyst preparation assembly.

Twenty-four rods containing different molarities of NaOH solutions were loaded into the Cubelab.
Another batch of 24 rods were prepared and kept in our laboratories as control. The CubeLab sample
holder was then tested for Vibration, vacuum, and off-gassing [55], veriﬁcation as per the NASA
space-ﬂight qualiﬁcation requirements and ﬂight safety regulations, and was sent to the International
Space Station (188). The samples were not exposed to air during this process. It should be noted that
188 was kept at 25 OC and 1 atm [55]. On approximately the same day, the control samples were
treated under similar reaction conditions and the solutions were mixed in our laboratories. No further
treatment was done until the samples prepared at 188 were delivered to our laboratories.

Following the delivery of the 188 samples, the samples were tested for ruptures. No serious
containment breaches were found. Following the inspection, all samples including the control were
ﬁltered and washed with deionized and distilled water until a pH of 7 is reached. The samples were
then dried in an oven at 90 OC overnight and were ready for characterization. Throughout the text,
the ceria samples prepared in normal-gravity and microgravity are referred to as control and space
samples, respectively.

3.2. Surface Analysis

BET surface area and pore volume measurements were carried out 011 a Micromerities ASAP 2020
(Norcross, GA, USA) accelerated surface area and porosimetry instrument. The samples were
degassed at 130 0C for 12 h prior to analysis under vacuum (<2 urn'Hg). Adsorption/desorption

isotherms were collected at liquid nitrogen temperature where the desorption branch of the isotherm
was used to calculate Barrett-Joyner-Halenda (BJH) pore size distributions.

3.3. T ransmission Electron Microscopy ( T EM

A Phillips Teenai F20 TEM (Hillsboro, OR, USA) equipped with a Field Emission Gun (PEG) and
operated at 200 kV was used for imaging the particles. A11 exposures were collected in the bright ﬁeld.
The samples were suspended in ethanol and were sonicated for ~10 min to improve dispersion.
Following sonication, the resulting mixture was immediately deposited on a 200-mesh copper grid
coated with laeey carbon in order to prevent agglomeration of the particles. Image J open-souree
processing and analysis software was used to estimate the particle sizes.

3.4. X-ray Diffraction (XRD)

XRD powder patterns were collected using a Rigaku diffractometer (Tokyo, Japan) with Cu KOL
radiation with 7» = 1.5418 A operated at 40 kV and 25 111A. The patterns were collected in the 20 range
of 200—750. International Center for Diffraction Data (ICDD) database was used for identiﬁcation of
the crystalline phases. The crystal size of the samples were calculated by Seherrer equation
L = Kk/Beose where K is the Seherrer constant, 7» is the wavelength of the X-ray, [3 is the full width
half maximum (FWHM), and 0 is the diffraction angle.

4. Conclusions

The effect of microgravity 0n eeria synthesis was investigated. Ceria was synthesized by mixing
cerium nitrate and sodium hydroxide solutions at room temperature, under both microgravity (space)
and normal-gravity (control) for comparison. The eeria samples that were prepared in space showed
lower surface area and pore volume compared to the Earth samples. BJH pore size analysis indicated
that the space eeria samples consisted of larger pores with a broader pore size distribution.
The morphology of the eeria particles were observed from TEM images. It was concluded that
the space samples were mostly nano-rods, whereas control samples contained nano-polyhedra.
The average particle size observed was larger for space eeria. From XRD results, space eeria samples
were more crystalline than the control samples. The mean crystal size obtained using Seherer equation
was larger in ease of space samples than control. The difference in particle size and shape between
space and control eeria is thought to be due to improved oriented attachment crystal growth process
where more collision of eeria particle occurs. This can be attributed to lack of sedimentation 0f
the eeria particles under microgravity condition. Lastly, the effect of pH was examined by changing
the concentration of sodium hydroxide solution (1 M and 3 M). The eeria samples synthesized under
normal-gravity at room temperature showed minimal differences between 1 M and 3 M. However,
a signiﬁcant decrease in particle size was observed for space samples which were prepared in a more
basic medium, with a number of nano-polyhedra and spheres also being present.
