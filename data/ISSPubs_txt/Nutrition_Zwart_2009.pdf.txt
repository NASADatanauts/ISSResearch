"3","ABSTRACT
NF-KB is a transcriptional activator of many genes, including some that lead to muscle
atrophy and bone resorption—signiﬁeant concerns for astronauts. NF-KB activation is
inhibited by eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA), but the inﬂuence of this omega-3 fatty acid on
the effects of weightlessness are unknown. We report here cellular, ground analog, and
spaceﬂight ﬁndings. We investigated the effects of EPA 0n differentiation of RAW264.7
monocyte/macrophage cells induced by receptor activator of NF-KB ligand (RANKL),
and on activation OfNF-KB by TNFOL or exposure to modeled weightlessness. EPA (50
pM for 24 h) inhibited RANKL-indueed differentiation and decreased activation of NF-
KB induced by 0.2 ug/ml TNFOL for 30 min or by modeled weightlessness for 24 h (p <
0.05). In human studies, we evaluated whether NF-KB activation was altered after short-
duration spaceﬂight, and determined the relationship between intake 0f0n1ega-3 fatty
acids and markers of bone resorption during bed rest, and the relationship between ﬁsh
intake and bone mineral density after long-duration spaceﬂight. NF-KB was elevated in
crew members after short-duration spaceﬂight, and higher consumption of ﬁsh (a rich
source of omega-3 fatty acids) was associated with reduced loss of bone mineral density
after ﬂight (p < 0.05). Also supporting the cell study ﬁndings, a higher intake of omega-
3 fatty acids was associated with less N—telopeptide excretion during bed rest (Pearson r =
-0.62, p < 0.05). Together, these data provide mechanistic cellular and preliminary
human evidence of the potential for EPA to counteract bone loss associated with
spaceﬂight.

"5","INTRODUCTION
Adaptations to weightlessness and associated health risks of spaceﬂight are extensive.
They include alterations in the musculoskeletal, cardiovascular, neurovestibular, immune,
endocrine, and other physiological systems. Understanding the nature and mechanisms
of changes in human physiology during space travel, and developing means to counteract
these effects Where necessary, is a primary concern for NASA and space agencies of
other nations.
Muscle oatabolism and bone loss are two physiological changes that occur upon exposure
to weightlessness, and both could degrade health and performance during a mission and
upon return to gravity. (1'3) There is great interest in developing countermeasures to
mitigate these processes, and although exercise (and other loading) and pharmacological
countermeasures have been proposed and tested, success has been limited. A dietary
countermeasure would be ideal to minimize launch mass, crew time and inconvenience,
and risk of side effects.
The activation of nuclear faetor-kappa B (NF-KB) is associated With the induction of
transcription factors critical for many processes related to injury and inﬂammation,
including various etiologies of muscle oatabolism and osteoclastogenesis. Hindlimb
suspension, a commonly used ground-based animal model of spaceﬂight, consistently
shows evidence for activation of NF-KB, Which is thought to be associated With the
mechanism of muscle atrophy observed in this model. (4'7) 111 hindlimb-unloading

5

"
"6","models, the activation OfNF-KB may result from altered InRN A expression OfNF-KB
subunits p50, Bel—3, and possibly e-Rel. (6) Other unloading studies have shown a role for
IkBa but not c-Rel. (5) Along With increasing expression OfNF-KB mRNA, skeletal
muscle hindlimb unloading in rats also increases NF-KB activation. Clearly, multiple
potential mechanisms can be hypothesized for the increase in NF-KB activation during
unloading.
The body of evidence is now substantial that dietary long-ehain 0mega-3 polyunsaturated
fatty acids such as eicosapentaenoie acid (EPA) have beneficial effects on bone (8'11) and
also on muscle during conditions With increased proteolysis and increased activation of
NF-KB. 02'” ) The protective effect of EPA has been attributed to its anti—inﬂammatory
actions and inhibition of signaling factors, such as NF-KB, that are associated With
inﬂammation and downstream activation of the ubiquitin—proteasome system and
osteoclasts. (14’16'20) In vitro models show that EPA can inhibit activation OfNF-KB by
several different stimuli, including lipopolysaccharide, RANKL, TNFOL, arachidonie acid,
and proteolysis-indueing factor. (8’17’21'24)
Evidence that modeled weightlessness can activate NF-KB, and that EPA can inhibit
activation of NF-KB, gives reason to believe that EPA could inhibit this pathway during
spaceﬂight 0r modeled spaceﬂight and have a protective effect on bone. In this article we
report the results of one study evaluating NF-KB activation in humans before and after
short-duration spaceﬂight, and three studies done to investigate the effects of EPA 011

"
"7","NF-KB activation or its effects in three different systems. The ﬁrst system was a cell
culture system that models weightlessness. We investigated the effect of EPA 011
osteoclast differentiation and NF-KB protein expression and activation in this system. To
accomplish this, we used a Rotary Cell Culture System (RCCS) equipped with a rotating
wall vessel bioreaetor. (25’26) In the RCCS, the culture vessel rotates around a horizontal
axis, and the cultured cells, bound to microcarrier beads, rotate at the same speed as the
vessel. This simulates weightlessness by randomizing the gravitational vector. The
second system was bed rest, a ground-based analo g of weightlessness. (2’27) We
investigated the relationship between the intake of omega-3 fatty acids and bone
resorption markers in healthy volunteers during 60 d of bed rest. The third system was
long-duration spaceﬂight; we evaluated the relationship between ﬁsh (and EPA) intake
and bone mineral density of astronauts 011 missions of 4—6 months 011 the International
Space Station.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Materials
EPA was purchased from Cayman Chemical Company (Ann Arbor, MI), and PBS and 0t-
MEM components were purchased from GIBCO (Invitrogen Corp, Carlsbad, CA).
RANKL was from Cell Signaling (Danvers, MA), and RAW264.7 murine
monocyte/macrophage cells were purchased from the American Type Culture Collection
(Manassas, VA).

7

"
"8","Cell Culture
RAW264.7 cells were maintained in DMEM with 10% sterile-ﬁltered fetal calf serum
supplemented with 2 mM glutamine, 100 IU/ml penicillin, and 100 pg/ml streptomycin
(Sigma-Aldrieh, St. Louis, MO). The cells were grown at 37°C in 5% C02 in humidified
air.
In vitro generation ofosteoclasts and determination ofosteoclastphenotype
RAW264.7 cells were plated in the medium described above and incubated in the
presence of 50 ng/ml RANKL for 5 days in T-75 ﬂasks (Fisher Scientiﬁc) with or
without EPA (50 MM). EPA was ﬁrst dissolved in ethanol as a stock solution and freshly
prepared with each experiment by diluting it in growth medium before adding it to the
cells. After the 5th day, the cultures were split, and cells were plated on chamber slides
with 2 chambers 011 each slide (Nune, Fisher Scientiﬁc) at a concentration of 1.5 x 106
cells/well. After the cells reached ~80% conﬂuence, the phenotype was determined by
staining the cells for tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase (TRAP) activity (Acid-
Phosphatase Kit, Sigma-Aldrieh). Four slides were prepared for each condition.
Differentiated osteoclasts were counted as the number of multinucleated, TRAP-positive
cells 011 each slide. Additionally, NF-KB p65 activity and protein expression were
determined as described below.

"
"9","Nuclear extraction
For collection of nuclear proteins from the cells, the cells were ﬁrst washed with PBS.
They were scraped off the culture dish and then collected using a Chemieon nuclear
extraction kit according to manufacturer’s instructions (Millipore, Billerica, MA).
NF- KB/DNA binding assay
The active form of NF-KB from nuclear fractions was measured using a commercially
available ELISA-based kit (StressGen Biotechnologies, Victoria, Canada). Data are
expressed as units of activity per pg protein.
Western blotting
The concentrations of protein were determined using a Markwell protein assay. (28) The
protein in the cell extract was concentrated with 10% trichloroacetie acid (Sigma-
Aldrieh). Equal amounts of cell extract (200 pg) were resolved with 10% SDS-PAGE
(precast Long-Life Gels, VWR, West Chester, PA), using samples diluted in 20 p1
sample dilution buffer (Sigma-Aldrieh) as previously described. (29) The resolved gel was
equilibrated in cold transfer buffer for 10 min and was then electroblotted t0
polyvinylidene ﬂuoride (PVDF) (Immobilon-P, Millipore, Bedford, MA) for 1 h at 30 V.
(29) The blot was stained with amide black stain [5 0% (V/V) methanol, 10% (V/V) glacial
acetic acid, naphthol blue black] and destained [50% (V/V) methane 1, 10% (V/V) glacial
acetic acid], and then washed with 2 changes of methanol before allowing it to air dry.

"
"10","For the detection of NF-KB p65, the blot was incubated in 0.5% nonfat dry milk (NFDM)
in Tris-buffered saline (20 mmol/l Tris, pH 7.4, 150 mmol/l NaCl) with 0.05% (V/V)
Tween—20 (TBST) for 1 h at room temperature. Subsequently, a 1:1000 dilution of rabbit
anti-NF-KB p65 (Cell Signaling Technology, Danvers, MA) in a 0.5% NFDM-TBST
solution was incubated with the blot overnight at 4°C. The blot was washed with 3
changes of TBST without NFDM, and then incubated with 1:2000 goat anti-rabbit IgG-
HRP (Cell Signaling) for 1 h at room temperature with gentle shaking. The PVDF was
washed 3 times in TBST without NFDM. A chemiluminescent substrate that exhibits
ﬂuorescent properties (ECL-Plus, GE Healthcare Life Sciences, Pittsburgh, PA) was then
applied to the blot and allowed to stand for 5 min. Placing the blot back into TBST
stopped the reaction. NF-KB p65 protein was detected and emitted ﬂuorescence
quantiﬁed on a Storm ﬂuorescent optical scanner as described by the manufacturer (GE
Healthcare Life Sciences). The specificity of this detection was confirmed through
competition with excess p65.
Effect ofEPA 0n NF-KB activation induced by T NFa in differentiated osteoclasts
Differentiated osteoclasts were grown to ~70% conﬂuence in T-75 ﬂasks and then
incubated for 24 h with or without 50 or 100 uM EPA. NF-KB was activated by
incubation with TNFoc (02 ug/ml) for 30 min. The cells from the T-75 ﬂasks were
washed with PBS, and nuclear proteins were extracted as described above. NF-KB p65
protein expression and activation were determined.

"
"11","Effect ofEPA 0n NF-KB activation induced by simulated microgravity in differentiated
osteoclasts
A high aspect ratio vessel (HARV) was used to provide an environment for the cells
where they would be in a continuous state of free-fall, similar to what is experienced in
weightlessness (Syntheeon, Houston, TX). The 50-1111 bioreaetor was inoculated with
CytodeX beads (Pharmacia), with a beadzcell ratio of 1 :20, and it was completely ﬁlled
with medium and all bubbles were removed. The bioreaetor was placed in an incubator
at 5% C02, 99% humidity, and 37°C. The vessel was rotated at a rate that maintained
suspension of the bead/cell complexes (about 12 rotations per minute).
A stationary co-eulture 0f RAW264.7 cells was grown and seeded onto CytodeX heads at
the same time and concentration as the cells placed in the bioreactor. These cells were
maintained in T-75 ﬂasks next to the bioreactor in the incubator throughout the studies.
Differentiated osteoclasts in the HARV and stationary eo-culture systems were grown to
~70% conﬂuence and then incubated for 24 h with or without 50 HM EPA. After 24 h,
the cells were processed and NF-KB activation and protein expression were determined as
described above.

"12","Studies with human subjects
Although the basic ﬁndings of the studies with human subjects have been previously
published (see details below), the relationships between dietary intake and bone health
have not been evaluated. As described in the original publications, all protocols were
reviewed and approved by the NASA J ohnson Space Center Committee for the
Protection of Human Subjects, and informed consent was obtained as required.
Spaceﬂight: Short-dumtion
We examined NF-KB p65 expression before and after short-duration spaceﬂight in a
study with 10 subjects (7 males, 3 females, age 36-54 y) from four Shuttle missions (12—
16 days each). No crew member participated in more than one of these missions. Crew
members were age- and seX-matohed with seven (5 male and 2 female) healthy control
subjects who were not involved in spaceﬂight activities.

Sample collection and preparation
Ten—milliliter blood samples were collected from the crew members 10 days before
launch (L-10), within 2—3 h after landing (R + 0), 3 days after landing (R + 3), and at
their postﬂight annual medical exams (AME) about 3—4 mo after ﬂight.
Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCS) were prepared by the method described
earlier. (30’3 1) Cells were counted with a hemooytometer and resuspended in 1 m1 of
freezing medium consisting of 90% pooled human blood group AB serum

12

"
"13","(BioWhittaker) and 10% dimethyl sulfoxide (Sigma-Aldrieh). These cells were then
eryopreserved by placing them in a —270°C bath of 100% ethanol and then transferred the
next day to liquid nitrogen, where they were stored until processed.

Immunolocalization ofNF-KB p65
The nuclear localization of p65 was examined using an immunocytochemieal method as
described previously. (32)
Spaceﬂight: Zong-dumtion
During long-duration spaceﬂight, crew members record their dietary intake once per
week using a food frequency questionnaire (FFQ). (33’34) A unique FFQ is designed for
each crew member based on the foods ﬂown for that mission (NutritionQuest;
www.Nutriti0nQuest.com). This FFQ has been validated in a ground-based model of
long-duration spaceﬂight, (33) and implemented on both the Russian Mir space station in
the 1990s (33) and all International Space Station (188) missions to date. Preliminary
findings were published in 2005. (34) Given that 1) space food systems are largely closed
(because the number of food items is limited and the menu cycle is repetitive), 2) portion
sizes are known, and 3) the precise nutrient content is known for each food item in the
system, the FFQ designed for spaceﬂight is more reliable than a standard food
questionnaire.

13

"
"14","The FFQ is designed to obtain a near-real—time estimate of intakes of seven key
nutrients—energy, protein, water, sodium, calcium, iron, and potassium—as well as to
collect information about supplement use and any crew comments. (35) In developing
each FFQ, available foods are categorized by content of the key nutrients, and crew
members are asked how many of each of the food items in that category were consumed
that week. Through evaluation of the food item data (as opposed to nutrient data), the
average number of ﬁsh servings per week was determined, to estimate omega-3 fatty acid
intake during ﬂight. Examples of ﬁsh selections in the 188 food system are salmon, pike
perch, sturgeon, anchovies, sardines, mackerel, and tuna.
Two 24-h urine pools were collected from 24 crew members about 6 months and 6 weeks
before ﬂight and during the ﬁrst 48 h after landing. N—telopeptide (NTX) was determined
in each 24-h pool, and postﬂight NTX was expressed as a percent change from the
average of all four of the preﬂight 24-h pool data points. As previously described, (34)
bone mineral density was determined about 180 and 45 days before and 5 days after each
ﬂight by dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DEXA) with a fan beam densitometer
(Hologio QDR 4500W, Hologio, 1110., Waltham, MA). These data, both bone marker and
DEXA data, have been published previously, (1’34) but without regard to relationship to
diet (as included here).
The changes in troohanter bone mineral density and NTX after ﬂight were correlated with
the estimated number of ﬁsh meals per week to approximate omega-3 fatty acid intake. It
14

"
"15","was not possible to determine precise omega-3 fatty acid intake from the FFQ data
because many of the ﬁsh items were categorized together in the FFQ.
Bed rest
Sixteen subjects participated in a series of bed rest studies, conducted at the University of
Texas Medical Branch General Clinical Research Center (GCRC) in Galveston, that were
undertaken to evaluate various physiological and nutritional changes during and after 60
or 90 days 0f 60 head-down tilt bed rest. Details of the bed rest protocols (36’37) and
dietary control (38) have been described elsewhere. Brieﬂy, a research dietitian worked
with each subject to come up with a menu to meet all of the subject’s nutrient
requirements and maintain bodyweight. Some variability in food choice was allowed so
that individual preferences and tolerances could be met while specific nutrient intakes
were maintained. Although protein and fat (and other nutrients) were controlled, ﬁsh
intake was not. All food was prepared in a metabolic kitchen and subjects were required
to consume 100% of the provided food, and to consume nothing in addition to what was
prepared in the kitchen. Diets were controlled for 10 days before bed rest started, while
the subjects were residing in the GCRC but were able to move around the unit.
All foods were weighed and actual dietary intakes were determined using the Nutrition
Data System for Research (NDS-R) software, version 5.0_35, May, 2004, developed by
the Nutrition Coordinating Center, University of Minnesota, Minneapolis, MN. (39) Total
omega-3 fatty acid intake was summed and a mean intake per day was determined.

"
"16","Twenty—four-hour urine pools were collected 10, 9, 3, and 2 days before bed rest.
Twenty—four-hour pools were also collected around days 59 and 60 of bed rest. Aliquots
of the combined voids were frozen at —80°C until they were analyzed. NTX
concentrations were determined in each of the 24-h urine p001 samples as described
previously. (34) The four pre-bed rest values were averaged and the BR5 9 and 60 data
were averaged. The percent change (from pre-bed rest) of NTX was determined and
correlated with the mean daily omega-3 fatty acid intake during the ﬁrst 60 days of bed
rest. Data from the ﬁrst 13 subjects are reported. These are considered control subjects
for other (ongoing) studies, in that 110 countermeasures were applied. The NTX data have
been published, (37’40) but without regard to relationship to diet (as included here).
Statistical analyses
In the cell studies a t—test was used to determine whether the means of two groups were
significantly different, or a one-way ANOVA and post hoe Bonferroni t—tests were used
to determine which of three or more groups were different from each other. A two-way
ANOVA was used to determine the effects of the modeled weightlessness and EPA
treatment, with a post hoe Bonferroni t—test to compare groups. Results from the cell
studies are representative of at least three separate evaluations.

16

"
"17","A two-way repeated-measures ANOVA was used, with ﬂight and time as variables, to
determine the effects of ﬂight 011 NF-KB activation. For this analysis, the AME data from
the ﬂight subjects was not included in the model. In a separate analysis, all data from the
ﬂight subjects, including the AME data, were compared in a one-way repeated-measures
ANOVA to determine whether NF-KB activation was still changed 3—4 months after
landing.
Pearson correlation coefﬁcients were determined for the association of omega-3 fatty
acid intake with markers of bone resorption after bed rest. A t—test was used to determine
whether bone markers differed between crew members who consumed 10w (< 3
servings/wk) and high (> 3 servings/wk) numbers of ﬁsh servings per week. A one-way
repeated-measures ANOVA was used to determine whether the total omega-3 fatty acid
intake during the 60 days of bed rest changed with time.
All statistical analyses were performed using SigmaStat 3.1 (SYSTAT Software,
Richmond, CA).

"18","RESULTS
Effect ofEPA 0n RA W264. 7 differentiation induced by RANKL
The number of TRAP-positive cells was 57% lower after 5 days of exposure to 50 MM
EPA than after exposure to RANKL alone (13.5 i 0.6 and 31.3 i 7.2 TRAP-positive cells
per well, respectively, p < 0.05), indicating that EPA inhibits RANKL-indueed
differentiation of RAW264.7 cells. RANKL itself did not change the activation of NF-
KB after 5 days of exposure, but EPA decreased both activation and protein expression of
NF-KB in RANKL-treated cells (Fig. 1).
Effect ofEPA 0n NF-KB activation induced by T NF 0c in differentiated osteoclasts
TNFOL increased NF-KB activation nearly 700% (p < 0.001) and protein expression 115%
(p < 0.05) after 30 min (Fig. 2). EPA decreased the activation and protein expression in a
dose-dependent manner When the cells were exposed to it for the 24 h before TNFOL
stimulation (Fig. 2).
Effect ofEPA 0n NF-KB activation induced by Simulated microgravity in differentiated
osteoclasts
Simulated weightlessness in the rotating HARV alone increased NF-KB activation by
10% (p < 0.05) and protein expression by 26% (p < 0.01) after 24 h (Fig. 3). EPA

18

"
"19","decreased NF-KB activation about 25% (p < 0.001) and protein expression about 15% (p

< 0.01) in both the stationary co-eulture and the simulated weightlessness environment.

Short-dumtion spaceﬂight

NF-KB p65 expression increased nearly 500% in the Shuttle crew members (p < 0.001)

after ﬂight (R+0), and it remained elevated for at least 14 days after ﬂight (Fig. 4). No

significant difference was observed between L-10 and baseline values of the astronauts or

between the three values for the control group.

Long-dumtion spaceﬂight

The mean number of servings of ﬁsh per week during spaceﬂight was 2.1 i 1.5 servings

per week (n = 17), and the number ranged from 0 to 4.6 servings per week. A higher

intake of ﬁsh was associated with a smaller decrease in whole-body bone mineral after

ﬂight (Fig. 5; Pearson r = 0.46, p < 0.05). A higher intake of ﬁsh tended to decrease the

change in whole-body bone mineral content when the latter was adjusted for height (p =

0.08, Fig. 5). The estimated number of ﬁsh servings per week was not related to the

percent change in urinary NTX excretion after spaceﬂight (data not shown).

Bed rest

The mean intake 0ft0ta10mega-3 fatty acids during 60 days of bed rest was negatively

correlated (Pearson r = —0.62) with the percent change in urinary NTX excretion from
19

"
"20","before bed rest to during bed rest (Fig. 6, p < 0.05). Total omega-3 fatty acid intake was
not signiﬁcantly different over the course of the 60 days of bed rest. In Fig. 7 , the change
in urinary NTX excretion during bed rest and after spaceﬂight is compared; the
overlapping time points were not signiﬁcantly different.
DISCUSSION
Activation of NF-KB by cytokines including TNFoc has been clearly documented. The
data presented here are the ﬁrst to show that NF-KB is also activated by short-duration
spaceﬂight, and this ﬁnding is supported in a ground-based model that exhibits some of
the effects of weightlessness on cell cultures, including reduced shear stress. We also
present evidence, from spaceﬂight itself and several ground analogs, that suggests that
omega-3 fatty acids may have a protective effect on bone, and the mechanism may be
related to decreased activation of NF-KB.
By a process that included decreasing NF-KB activation and p65 expression, EPA
inhibited differentiation of RAW264.7 cells into osteoclast-like cells. RANKL stimulates
RAW264.7 cells to differentiate, but there was no evidence that RANKL activated NF-
KB in these studies (note the y-aXis scale in Fig. 1). It is likely that the activation was
transient, occurring before 5 days, as we would have expected RANKL to activate NF-
KB. EPA also decreased the NF-KB activation and protein expression induced by
exposure to TNFoc for 30 min. TNFoc is a known activator of NF-KB, and others have

20

"
"21","reported that omega-3 fatty acids can inhibit this activation. (41) 111 cell culture models,
simulated weightlessness increases TNFoc production, (42’43) and it activates NF-KB in
other cell culture and animal models. (4447) This is why we predicted that NF-KB would
be activated in this model, and would be inhibited by EPA.
Exposure to a model that exhibits some of the effects of weightlessness, as observed in
the HARV, increased NF-KB activation and p65 protein expression after 24 h. Further
studies need to be performed to determine the time course of activation after exposure to
simulated weightlessness, as our study shows only one time point. The hindlimb
suspension model, another ground analog for weightlessness, is associated with increased
expression of an NF-KB-dependent reporter after 7 days, although the p50 and not the
p65 subunit was increased. (6) Other studies of unloading have shown a similar activation
of NF-KB within several days to weeks, but involved different mechanisms of activation.
(5’48) The increased activation of NF-KB after 12—16 days of spaceﬂight in the study
presented here is striking, and suggests that the activation is not a transient effect.
The NF-KB pathway is complex and is activated by phosphorylation, ubiquitination, and
proteolysis of the inhibitory protein IKB, whioh nominally binds NF-KB in the cytosol in
the inactive form. Activation of the NF-KB pathway in modeled or actual weightlessness
could involve a number of different mechanisms, and different subunits such as p50, 0-
Rel, and Col—3 need to be investigated to better understand the whole picture. We chose
21

"
"22","to ﬁrst study the effects of EPA on p65 in the HARV model because previous work
showed that EPA and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) could inhibit nuclear p65 expression
in RAW264.7 cells.(8)
Clearly, more studies should be done to better characterize the effects observed here,
including time-eourse studies and dose-response effects on differentiation. For example,
the reason NF-KB activation in osteoclasts did not decrease even though a decrease in
protein expression was observed should be investigated. Further studies need to be done
to determine if in fact EPA has a dose-response effect 011 osteoclast differentiation,
perhaps With lower doses than those used in this study.
The bed rest and spaceﬂight data provide evidence that the amount of omega-3 fatty acids
required to observe a protective effect on bone is nutritional, and not pharmacological. If
it is assumed that a lOO-g serving of salmon provides about 930 mg 0ft0ta10mega-3 fatty
acids, (49) then the bed rest subjects consumed the equivalent 0f0.5—1.5 servings of
sa1m0n(0r a food item With an equivalent amount of omega-3 fatty acids) per day. Long-
duration crew members consumed an overall average of 2.1 ﬁsh servings per week (0.3
servings per day, or less than the bed rest subjects consumed).
The lower percent change in Whole-body bone mineral density after spaceﬂight in crew
members WhO consumed more ﬁsh meals per week (and the tendency for the lower

22

"
"23","percent change in whole-body bone mineral content adjusted for height) supports the
finding of Rousseau and colleagues that a higher self—reported dietary intake of omega-3
fatty acids is associated with higher bone mineral density in older adults. (50) That study
divided the omega-3 intake into a high (> 1.27 g/d) and a low group (< 1.27 g/d), and if
the same assumption applies (a 100-g salmon serving equals 930 mg t0ta10mega-3s),
then 1.27 g/d is approximately equal to 1.3 salmon meals per week. Controlled feeding
trials of other n-3 fatty acids have shown them to have positive effects on bone markers.
(51) Animal studies have also documented positive effects of ﬁsh oil on bone in mice. (52)
Although the correlation between urinary NTX and ﬁsh intake data from the long-
duration ﬂight study was not as high as the correlation between these variables from the
bed rest study, several differences could explain this, two of them being critical to the
explanation. First of all, there was a difference in the timing of collections. The bed rest
urine data were collected during bed rest, while the postﬂight urine samples were
collected after landing, and likely do not reﬂect the level of resorption that would have
been seen days earlier during weightlessness. Furthermore, the methods of dietary intake
assessment in the two studies were very different. The bed rest dietary intake data were
generated from weighing the food items and determining nutrient content from the NDS-
R nutrient database, whereas ﬂight dietary intake data came from the answers to a food
frequency questionnaire in which food items are grouped into categories based on their
content of specific nutrients, so that ﬁsh with different EPA contents are often combined.
The ﬂight data are inherently less accurate for omega-3 fatty acid intake than are the bed
23

"
"24","rest data, and they should be taken as rough estimates. Nonetheless, the ﬂight data
support the bed rest data, and both support the cell culture data showing that EPA
inhibited osteoclastogenesis. Although the mechanistic studies support the hypothesis
that EPA intake is inhibiting osteoclastogenesis, it is also possible that While consuming
fish, these orewmembers/subjeots were not consuming other foods that may have been
supportive (or passive) With respect to bone resorption.
We looked at the relationship between ﬁsh or EPA and bone, but extensive data eXist
regarding the effects of EPA (and other n-3 fatty acids) on other systems of concern for
space travelers, including muscle atrophy and immune function. NF-KB activation is
associated With several etiologies of muscle protein loss, including disuse. Disuse
atrophy (such as occurs in bed rest) is accompanied by activation and increased InRN A
expression of NF-KB. (4’6) This mechanism also appears in muscle loss in cancer
oaoheXia, sepsis, diabetes, and other muscle-wasting diseases. (53) The ability of EPA to
mitigate the muscle loss in these conditions has also been documented, (54’55) and provides
strong evidence for the likelihood of success With using it during spaceﬂight. (53)
The results presented here provide evidence that EPA can decrease NF-KB activation by
known activators and modeled weightlessness in a HARV, in addition to decreasing
osteoclast differentiation. This evidence is supported in the bed rest and spaceﬂight
models, Where bone loss is a known health issue. We now have evidence that NF-KB is
24

"
"25","activated after short-duration spaceﬂight, and therefore inhibition of NF-KB activation
could have many beneficial downstream effects to counteract the negative effects of
spaceﬂight on bone, muscle, and immune function. Beyond muscle, bone, and immune
ﬁanction, the role of n-3 fatty acids in cancer prevention is currently being investigated in
animal models of spaceﬂight radiation effects, With positive results. (56-61) Thus, there
is a good possibility that something as simple as a menu change to increase ﬁsh intake
might serve as a countermeasure to help mitigate risks related to bone, muscle, immune
ﬁanction, and potentially even radiation. Intervention studies With dietary sources of
omega-3 fatty acids are warranted to better understand the mechanism of their action on
bone and to determine their effects on other physiological systems (such as muscle and
antioxidant defenses). These data Will have significant implications for future space
exploration, and could beneﬁt the general population.
