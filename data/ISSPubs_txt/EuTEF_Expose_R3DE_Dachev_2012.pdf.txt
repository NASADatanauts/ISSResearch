the EXPOSE-E MISSIon: The R3DE Instrument

Abstract
The aim of this paper is to present the time profile of cosmic radiation exposure obtained by the Radiation Risk
Radiometer-Dosimeter during the EXPOSE-E mission in the European Technology Exposure Facility on the Inter-
national Space Station’s Columbus module. Another aim is to make the obtained results available to other EXPOSE-E
teams for use in their data analysis. Radiation Risk Radiometer-Dosimeter is a low-mass and small-dimension
automatic device that measures solar radiation in four channels and cosmic ionizing radiation as well. The main
results of the present study include the following: (1) three different radiation sources were detected and quanti-
fied—galactic cosmic rays (GCR), energetic protons from the South Atlantic Anomaly (SAA) region of the inner
radiation belt, and energetic electrons from the outer radiation belt (ORB); (2) the highest daily averaged absorbed
dose rate of 426 uGy d _ 1 came from SAA protons; (3) GCR delivered a much smaller daily absorbed dose rate of 91.1
uGy d‘ 1, and the ORB source delivered only 8.6 uGy d _ 1. The analysis of the UV and temperature data is a subject of
