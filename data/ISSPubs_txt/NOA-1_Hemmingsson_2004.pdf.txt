GCH/Hbm3 itoring of inﬂammatory disease processes such as asthma. We
— set out to develop a novel hand—held N O—analyzer With a per—
formance comparable to the present more costly and complex
chemiluminescence instruments. The new device is based on a
specially designed electrochemical sensor, Where we have devel—
oped a novel sampling and analysis technology, compensating for
the relatively slow response properties of the electrochemical sen—
sor technique. A Lowest Detection Limit in NO—analysis from
reference gas tests Ofless than 3 ppb and a response time Of 15 sec—
0nds together With an average precision in human breath mea—
surements of 1.4 ppb were Obtained. We also show an agreement
With the existing ‘gold standard’ FENO measurement technique,
Within 0.5 ppb in a group of 19 subjects together With a high
linearity and accuracy compared to reference gases. The new
analyzer enables affordable monitoring of inﬂammatory airway
diseases in research and routine clinical practice.

BACKGROUND
The chemically simple molecule NO, i.e. nitric OX—
ide/nitric monoxide, has gained an increasing interest dur—
ing the last two decades of medical research. It is involved
in neurotransmission, blood pressure regulation, immune
defence mechanisms and airway inﬂammation. The highly
reactive property Ofnitric oxide in biological tissue makes a
direct measurement of tissue NO difﬁcult. Therefore, the
measurement has Often been made by indirect determi—
nation of L—citrulline, a metabolite produced When NO
is formed from the amino acid L—arginine. Alternatively,
it could be indirectly determined Via the stable break—
down products nitrate N03— or nitrite N02— , i.e. oxidized
metabolites of NO, When it is synthesized Within cells Via
either 0fthree NO synthase (NOS) enzymes from the cor—
responding encoding gene.
