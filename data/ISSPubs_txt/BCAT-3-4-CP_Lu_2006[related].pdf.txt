We show that colloidal particles with attractive interactions induced by a nonadsorbing polymer eXhibit
a stable phase consisting of a ﬂuid of Clusters of particles. This phase persists even in the absence of any
long-range repulsion due to Charge, contrary to expectations based on simulation and theory. Cluster
morphology depends strongly on the range of the interparticle attraction: With a shorter range, Clusters are
tenuous and branched; with a longer range, they are more compact.
