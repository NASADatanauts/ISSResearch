- ABSTRACT ‘ ‘
Heavy ions are more efﬁcient in producing complex-type chromosome exchanges than i
- sparsely ionizing radiation, and this can potentially be used as a biomarker of radiation
quality. We measured the induction of complex—type chromosomal aberrations in human K
peripheral blood lymphocytes exposed in vitro to accelerated H-, He-, C-, Ar-, Fe- and
Au-ions in the LET range of approximately 0.4-1400 keV/um. Chromosomes were
analyzed either at the ﬁrst post-irradiation mitosis, or in interphase, following premature
. condensation by phosphatase inhibitors. Selected chromosomes were then visualized after
FISH-painting. The dose-response curve for the induction of complex-type exchanges by
heavy ions was linear in the dose-range 0.2-1.5 Gy, while y-rays did not produce a
signiﬁcant increase in the yield of complex rearrangements in this dose range. The yield
of complex aberrations after 1 Gy of heavy ions increased up to an LET around 100
keV/pm, and then declined at higher LET values. When mitotic cells were analyzed, the
frequency of complex rearrangements after 1 Gy was about 10 times higher for AI- or Fe-
ions (the most effective ions, with LET around 100 keV/um) than for 250 MeV protons,
and values were about 35 times higher in prematurely condensed chromosomes. These
results suggest that complex rearrangements may be detected in astronauts’ blood
lymphocytes after long-term space ﬂight, because crews are exposed to HZE particles
from galactic cosmic radiation. However, in a cytogenetic study of ten astronauts after
long-term missions on the Mir or International Space Station, we found a very low
frequency of complex rearrangements, and a signiﬁcant post-ﬂight increase was detected
in only one out of the ten crewmembers. It appears that the use of complex-type

INTRODUCTION

The clustered DNA damage induced by high-LET radiation elicits a different

pattern of chromosome damage than low-LET exposures where the energy, and
consequently the DNA damage, is more evenly distributed (Durante et al., 1998; Moquet
et al., 2001; Testard et al., 1997; Wu et al., 1997). The distinctions between ratios of
speciﬁc types of chromosome exchanges induced by high— and low-LET radiation has
been exploited as a signature of radiation quality (Bauchinger and Schmid, 1997; Brenner
and Sachs, 1994; Savage and Papworth, 1996), although few experimental results have
supported model predictions. Complex-type chromosome exchanges, deﬁned as
exchanges involving a minimum of three breaks in two or more chromosomes, are
induced much more efﬁciently by high-LET radiation, whereas doses of low LET-
radiation below 2 Gy do not induce signiﬁcant levels of complex-type chromosome
damage (Simpson and Savage 1996). Complex chromosome damage is also much more
prevalent than was initially thought. Chromosome painting and mFISH techniques have
demonstrated that many exchanges initially assumed to involve a simple two-way
reciprocal exchange are actually complex in nature (Comforth 2001; Durante et al., 2002;
Simpson et al., 1999). It follows therefore that an increase in complex chromosome
damage can potentially be used as a realistic working biomarker of exposure 'to low doses g
of high-LET radiation, if signiﬁcant levels of complex chromosome damage are induced.
While the true complexity of exchanges can only be determined by analyzing all
chromosomes simultaneously, many complex patterns of damage can be detected by -
painting two or three chromosome pairs and large numbers of cells can be analyzed,
allowing radiations of different qualities to be compared fairly rapidly.

Previous studies have indicated difﬁculties in accurately estimating high-LET
induced chromosome damage at ﬁrst mitosis post irradiation, due to a delay in the

’ expression of chromosome damage in metaphase that is mostly related to the late
emergence of complex-type damage (Anderson et al., 2000; George et al., 2001b; Ritter
et al., 2000; Scholtz et al., 1998). It has been suggested that the yield of complex
chromosome damage could be underestimated when analyzing metaphase cells collected
at one time point after irradiation, and chemically-induced premature chromosome
condensation (PCC) may be a more accurate system since problems with complicated
cell-cycle delays are reduced (Durante et al., 1997; George et al., 2001b).

Studies of chromosome damage in astronauts’ peripheral blood lymphocytes after
space missions lasting more than 3 months have found signiﬁcant increases in the
frequency of total exchanges. (George et al., 2001a; Obe et al., 1997 ; Testard et al., 1997;
Yang et al.,1997). An increase in the yield of complex exchanges after ﬂight could
estimate the level of exposure to heavy particles and help"" improve health risk. estimates
for astronauts.

In this study we have used chromosome painting to analyze complex exchanges
induced in human lymphocytes after in vitro exposures to several accelerated ions with

. LET values ranging from approximately 0.4 to 1400 keV/pm, and for direct in viva

measurements of complex damage in astronauts blood lymphocytes after space ﬂight. For
both in vitro and in vivo studies the frequency of complex exchanges were assessed in ‘
metaphase and in chemically induced PCC.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Irradiation
Whole blood, collected from a healthy volunteer, was irradiated in specially
designed polyethylene holders with a 1 mm thick well for the sample. The particles used
in this study are listed in table 1 along with their primary LET values and the facilities
where the particles were accelerated. All samples were exposed at room temperature and
dose rates varied from approximately 0.2 Gy/min to 1 Gy/min depending on the dose
delivered, each sample received at least 3 pulses and no exposure lasted more than 10
minutes. Doses were measured at the target using ionization chambers. Uniformity of the
dose to the target area was measured by exposing photographic ﬁlm.
Chromosome Preparation
Immediately after exposure, whole blood cultures containing RPMI 1640 media
(Gibco BRL) supplemented with 20% calf serum, and 1% phytohemagglutinin (Gibco,
BRL) were incubated at 37°C. Following a 2-hour treatment with 6 pM colcemid (Gibco,
BRL), metaphase cells were collected after 48-50 hours in culture, using standard '
harvesting procedures. ’4'
For PCC samples, whole blood was incubated for 48—50 hours in the same culture
media as described above, and the chemically induced PPC were collected using the _ .
method described by Durante et al. (1999); Brieﬂy, 50 nM calyculin A (Wako
Chemicals) was added to the growth media for the last 30 minutes of the incubation.
Cells were then treated with hypotonic KCl (0.075M) for 15 minutes at 37 °C and ﬁxed
> in methanolzacetic acid (3:1).
Fluorescence in situ Hybridization
Chromosome spreads were dropped onto clean microscope slides and hybridized in
situ with a combination of two or three ﬂuorescence whole chromosome probes (V ysis)
using the procedures recommended by the manufacturer. When two probes were used
together, one chromosome was painted with a spectrum green probe and the other with a
spectrum orange probe. In cases where three chromosomes were painted the third
chromosome was painted with a 1:1 combination of spectrum green and orange probe
that appeared yellow under the triple—band—pass ﬁlter set. Unlabelled chromosomes were
always counterstained with 4',6-diamidino—2-phenylindole (DAPI).
Classiﬁcation of Aberrations
Chromosomes were analyzed with a Zeiss Axioplan ﬂuorescence microscope. The
number of cells scored for each in vitro irradiated sample varied from 200 to over 3,000.
For astronaut samples at least 4,000 cells were assessed pre and post-ﬂight. A11 slides
analyzed in this study were coded and scored blind. Chromosome damage was assessed

"

in cells where the chromosomes were well spread and well painted, appeared to be intact,
and had clear centromere signal under DAPI illumination. Complex exchanges were
scored when it was determined that an exchange involved a minimum of three breaks in
two or more chromosomes (Savage and Simpson, 1994). Dicentrics and simple reciprocal
exchanges were scored as simple-type exchanges. Incomplete translocations and
dicentrics were included with the simple exchanges. When two or more painted
chromosomes were damaged, each was scored separately.
Statistical Analysis
The frequency of chromosomal aberrations in the painted chromosome(s) was
evaluated as the ratio between aberrations scored and total observed cells. Standard errors
on the frequencies were calculated assuming Poisson statistics. Error bars in each ﬁgure
represent standard errors of the mean values. Not all experiments were analyzed using the
same combination of chromosome probes Several studies have demonstrated that
radiation induced damage is distributed randomly between chromosomes and the yield of
exchanges measured within the ﬁrst division after exposure is pr0portional to the DNA
content of the chromosome analyzed, with some ﬂuctuation of data. (Kovacs et a1., 1994;
Lucas et a1., 1992; Luomahaara et a1., 1999; Tucker et a1., 1994,). Therefore, for a direct
comparison of data, the frequencies of exchanges in individual chromosomes were
extrapolated to whole genome equivalents using a modiﬁed version of the Lucas et a1.
(1992) formula, Fp=2.05[fp(1-fp)+fp1fp2+fp1fp3+fp2fp3}FG. Fp is the combined
frequency of exchanges in all painted chromosomes, fp is the fraction of the whole
genome comprised of the painted chromosomes, fpl, fp2, and fp3 are the fractions of the
genome for each individual chromosome. For each experiment a control sample of at ”
least 800 unexposed cells were analyzed to determine the background frequency of
aberrations. The values for the whole genome equivalents represent data after individual .
background has been subtracted. ‘

When the number of exchanges induced by 1 Gy of each ion is plotted against LET
value (Figure 3), the frequency of both simple and complex exchanges peak at around
100 KeV/um and decrease at higher LET values. The trend is similar for FCC and

I metaphase analysis. However, PCC analysis produces much higher values for both
simple and complex exchanges. At the peak region of the curve simple exchanges are
approximately two fold higher in FCC than ﬁst division metaphase cells, and complex
exchanges are almost four fold higher.

Direct in vivo measurements of complex exchanges in blood lymphocytes from 10 '
astronauts measured before and after 3—6 month missions onboard the Mir or ISS are
shown in Figure 4. All post ﬂight samples were collected within 10 days of return from
the mission, and metaphase cells were analyzed. Complex exchanges were detected in
most preﬂight samples. Only one astronaut (crewmember one) had a signiﬁcant post -
ﬂight increase in complex exchanges. The frequency of complex damage was very low
and in most cases only one or two complex exchanges were detected in several thousand
cells analyzed.

CONCLUSIONS
The RBE for the induction of complex exchanges. is dose-dependent, and at doses
below 2 Gy it is very high, since gamma rays do not induce signiﬁcant levels of complex
damage below this dose. However, there is some indication that very low doses of heavy
ions (below 20 cGy) may also be ineffective in inducing complex rearrangements if

scored in metaphase cells (ﬁgure 1b). The RBB-LET relationship for the induction of
simple and complex-type exchanges reaches a maximum around 100 keV/um', and
declines at very high-LET. This is consistent with previously published results for
induction of chromosome damage (Testard et a1., 1997) and for other biological
endpoints, i.e. transtrmation (Yang et a1., 1985), cell survival (Furusawa et al., 2000)
and mutations (Kiefer et al., 2001). '

Analysis of FCC gives much higher RBE values than ﬁrst division metaphase

' samples collected at one time point after exposure. This is true for both for simple— and
complex-type interchanges. In metaphase samples, the frequency of complex
rearrangements after 1 Gy was about 10 times higher for AI- or Fe-ions (the most
effective ions with LET around 100 keV/um) than for 250 MeV protons, compared with
an increase of about 35 fold when chemically induced PCC are analyzed. Therefore cell
cycle delays affect the expression of damage, particular complex damage, in metaphase,
and this should be considered when assessing RBE from induction of chromosome
damage. -

Since the RBE for the induction of complex-type exchanges at low doses of densely
ionizing radiation is very high, this suggests complex exchanges could be a useful
functioning biomarker of exposure to high-LET radiation. However, very low frequencies
of complex aberrations were detected in astronauts after long duration space missions and
complexes can be found in the background yield of aberrations, complicating analysis at
very low doses. The yield of chromosome damage was similar in FCC and metaphase for
astronauts’ post-ﬂight samples indicating that mitotic delay ’does not seem to affect the
yield of exchanges in this case. -

We note that, in most cases, total chromosome exchanges do yield statistically *‘I
signiﬁcant increases in astronauts’ post ﬂight samples (George et al. 2001a, Yang et a1.
1997). However, direct in vivo measurements of chromosome damage in astronauts
indicate that the use of complex-type chromosome exchanges as a biomarker of radiation '
quality after low-dose chronic exposure in a mixed radiation ﬁeld is indeed hampered by
statistical uncertainties.
