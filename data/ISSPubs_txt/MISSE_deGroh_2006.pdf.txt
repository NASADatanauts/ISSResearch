ABSTRACT
Forty-one different polymer samples, collectively called the Polymer Erosion and Contamination
Experiment (PEACE) Polymers, have been exposed to the low Earth orbit (LEO) environment
on the exterior of the International Space Station (188) for nearly four years as part of Materials
International Space Station Experiment 2 (MISSE 2). The objective of the PEACE Polymers
experiment was to determine the atomic oxygen erosion yield of a wide variety of polymeric
materials after long term exposure to the space environment. The polymers range from those
commonly used for spacecraft applications, such as Teﬂon (DuPont) FEP, to more recently
developed polymers, such as high temperature polyimide PMR (polymerization of monomer
reactants). Additional polymers were included to explore erosion yield dependence upon
chemical composition. The MISSE PEACE Polymers experiment was ﬂown in MISSE Passive
Experiment Carrier 2 (PEC 2), tray 1, on the exterior of the ISS Quest Airlock and was exposed
to atomic oxygen along with solar and charged particle radiation. MISSE 2 was successfully
retrieved during a space walk on July 30, 2005 during Discovery’s STS-114 Return to Flight
mission. Details on the speciﬁc polymers ﬂown, ﬂight sample fabrication, pre-ﬂight and post-
ﬂight characterization techniques, and atomic oxygen ﬂuenoe calculations are discussed along
with a summary of the atomic oxygen erosion yield results. The MISSE 2 PEACE Polymers
experiment is unique because it has the widest variety of polymers ﬂown in LEO for a long
duration and provides extremely valuable erosion yield data for spacecraft design purposes.
1. INTRODUCTION
Polymers such as polyimide Kapton (DuPont) and Teﬂon FEP (ﬂuorinated ethylene propylene)
are commonly used spacecraft materials because of their desirable properties such as ﬂexibility,
low density, and electrical, thermal and optical properties. Materials on the exterior of spacecraft
are exposed to atomic oxygen (A0) in the low Earth orbit (LEO) environment. Atomic oxygen
is formed when short wavelength ultraviolet radiation from the Sun photodissooiates molecular
oxygen in the upper atmosphere. Although A0 is the predominant species in LEO (below
z1,000 km), these neutral oxygen atoms have mean free paths on the order of 104 m at 400 km,
resulting in extremely low probabilities of re-assooiation. As a spacecraft orbits the Earth it
travels with a velocity on the order of 7.7 km/seo and rams into the oxygen atoms. The ﬂux of
A0 at International Space Station (188) altitudes is approximately 5.23><1013 atoms/om2 sec for

energy of an oxygen atom impacting spacecraft at ram velocities is 4.5 eV [1].
A number of processes can take place when an oxygen atom strikes a spacecraft surface at orbital
velocities. These include chemical reaction with surface molecules, elastic scattering, scattering
with partial or full thermal accommodation, recombination, 0r excitation of ram species [2].
Because the ﬁnal oxidation product for most polymers is a gas, AO erosion results. Materials
with volatile oxidation products develop a cone-like morphology under directed AO attack.
Atomic oxygen erosion of polymers in LEO is a serious threat to spacecraft performance and
durability. It is therefore essential to understand the AO erosion yield, By, the volume loss per
incident oxygen atom (em3/at0m) of polymers for spacecraft applications.
Forty-one different polymer samples, collectively called the Polymer Erosion and Contamination
Experiment (PEACE) Polymers, have been exposed to the LEO space environment on the
exterior of the 188 for nearly four years as part of Materials International Space Station
Experiment 1 & 2 (MISSE 1 & 2). The purpose of the MISSE PEACE Polymers experiment
was to accurately determine the AO erosion yield of a wide variety of polymeric materials
exposed for an extended period of time to the LEO space environment [3]. The polymers range
from those commonly used for spacecraft applications, such as Teﬂon FEP, to more recently
developed polymers, such as high temperature polyimide PMR (polymerization of monomer
reactants). Additional polymers were included to explore erosion yield dependence upon
chemical composition. Details on the speciﬁc polymers ﬂown, ﬂight sample fabrication, pre-
ﬂight and post-ﬂight characterization techniques, and atomic oxygen ﬂuenee determination are
discussed along with a summary of the atomic oxygen erosion yield results.
2. EROSION YIELD MEASUREMENTS
2.1 Erosion Yield Determination
A common technique for determining the erosion yield (Ey) of ﬂight samples is based on mass
loss and is calculated based on mass measurements before and after ﬂight. The erosion yield of
the sample is determined through the following equation:

Ey : $ (1)

(As ,OSF)

where
Ey = erosion yield ofﬂight sample (cm3/at0m)
AMS = mass loss offheﬂight sample (g)
AS = surface area offheﬂight sample exposed to atomic oxygen attack (cm2)
p5 = density ofﬂight sample (g/cm3)
F = ﬂuence ofatomic oxygen (atoms/cm2)
The A0 ﬂuence (F) can be determined through the mass loss of a Kapton H witness sample
because Kapton H has a well characterized erosion yield (3.0><10'24 em3/at0m) in the LEO
environment [4]. Therefore, the AO ﬂuenee can be calculated using the following equation:
NASA/TM—2006-214482 2

"
"7","AM
F = —K (2)
(AK PK EK)

where
F = low Earth orbitAOﬂuence (atoms/cm2)
AMK = mass loss ofKapton H witness sample (g)
A K = surface area ofKapton H witness sample exposed to atomic oxygen (cm2)
pK = density ofKapton H witness sample (1.42 g/cm3)
E K = erosion yield ofKapton H witness sample (3.0X10'24 cm3/at0m)
Thus

Ey : EK 5—10 (3)

AM 1045,05

Another technique for determining erosion yield is based on recession depth measurements.
Because many of the PEACE Polymers are composed of multiple thin film layers (see section
4.1) and because erosion can occur in multiple layers at one time, as shown in the UpileX-S and
Kapton H samples in Section 8 below, it was decided that mass loss is the best technique for this
ﬂight experiment. In addition, individual layers can be so fragile after erosion that recession
depth measurements would be impossible to obtain. With mass loss measurements, an average
mass of the fragile pieces and layers and underlying non-eroded supportive layers can be
obtained.
2.2 RehydrationfDehydration Issues
One of the critical issues with using mass loss for obtaining accurate erosion yield data is that
dehydrated mass measurements are needed. Many polymer materials, such as Kapton, are very
hygroscopic (absorbing up to 2% of their weight in moisture) and can ﬂuctuate in mass with
humidity and temperature. Therefore, for accurate mass loss measurements to be obtained, it is
necessary that the samples be fully dehydrated (i.e. in a vacuum desiccator) prior to measuring
the mass for both pre-ﬂight and post-ﬂight.
3. PEACE POLYMERIC MATERIALS
The speciﬁc polymers chosen for the MISSE PEACE Polymers experiment represent a wide
range of polymeric materials and bonding types. Included are those commonly used for
spacecraft applications, such as Teﬂon FEP, to more recently developed polymers, such as high
temperature polyimide PMR (polymerization of monomer reactants). Polymers such as
polyethylene oxide and cellulose acetate are also included based solely on their chemical
composition to provide LEO erosion yield data for modeling purposes. Two polyimide Kapton
H samples were included to serve as ﬂuence calibration witness samples. The 41 polymers, their
associated polymer abbreviations and the MISSE serial numbers are listed in Table 1.

"9","4. SAMPLE FABRICATION & PRE-FLIGHT CHARACTERIZATION

4.1 Flight Sample Dimensions & Fabrication

The MISSE PEACE Polymers samples were approximately 2.54 cm diameter disks. The
polymers were most often obtained in thin ﬁlm form, typically ranging from 0.0025 cm to 0.051
cm thick and were punched into the circular disks using a double bow punch cutter and an Arbor
press.

Several samples did not come in film form. Allyl diglyool carbonated (ADC, 2-E5-14), typically
used as lens material, was ordered from a manufacturer in 2.54 cm diameter, 0.079 cm thick
samples. Pyrolytio graphite (PG, 2-E5-25) was also ordered in 2.54 cm diameter pieces, 0.203
cm thick. Hysol EA956 epoxy (EP, 2-E5-19) was purchased as a two-part kit. Flight samples
were fabricated by mixing and curing the epoxy, and then carefully sawing out 2.54 cm diameter
samples from brittle sheets of cured epoxy. The thickness of the ﬂight sample is z 0.231 cm
thick. Polyethylene oxide (PEO, 2-E5-17) was purchased as a powder and fabricated into sheet
material by pressing the powder with heated plates using a Carver Laboratory Press. To keep the
PEO from sticking to the plates, two sheets of Kapton were placed in between the press plates
and the PEO powder. The PEO was pressed at 23,000 lb (10.5 metric tons) for 5-10 seconds
while simultaneously applying heat. The exact temperature of heating is not known, but the
press heats to 260 0C (500 0F) and approximately 40% of the power was used. After pressing,
when completely cooled, the Kapton sheets were carefully separated from the PEO. This
resulted in a sheet of PEO between 0.74 cm and 0.94 cm thick, from which 2.54 cm diameter
samples were punched out. High temperature polyimide resin, PMR-15 (PI, 2-E5-34), was
fabricated by the Polymers Branch at GRC in 2.54 cm diameter, 0.030 cm thick pieces. Poly-(p—
phenylene terephthalamide), also known as Kevlar 29 (PPD-T, 2-E5-8), was obtained in fabric
form. Flight samples were out out and the fabric samples were carefully wrapped in Al disks to
protect the edges from fraying or loosing small filaments. The extreme edge on the exposed side
was covered with Al in such a way that only the Kevlar would be exposed to A0 in the ﬂight
hardware. Polyphenylene isophtalate (PPPA), also known as NomeX (DuPont), was supplied as
0.005 cm thick sheets of paper, from which ﬂight samples were easily punched out.

4.2 Sample Stacking

MISSE 1 & 2 were originally planned for a 1-year mission. The expected AO ﬂuenoe for a 1-
year exposure on 188 was 3.28><1021 atoms/om2 for directed AO exposed surfaces, based on a
mission launch date of June 2001, a 400 km circular orbit and a 51.60 inclination. For many of
the thin ﬁlm polymers, a single layer would be completely eroded away after a 1-year mission.
In addition, ﬂight experiments are not always retrieved on the original planned date, but can be
left in space much longer. Therefore, depending on the polymer thickness and estimated erosion
yield, stacking of several sample layers was necessary. The total number of layers to be stacked
for ﬂight was chosen based on surViVing a 3-year mission (3 times the duration of the original
planned mission).

Stacking of the sample layers is complicated by the fact that increasing the mass of the sample
causes a decrease in the sensitivity of the mass change. Therefore, one would ideally want to
NASA/TM—2006-2l4482 5

"
"10","measure the lightest sample possible before and after ﬂight so the mass loss is a signiﬁcant
percent of the total mass of the sample. Keeping this in mind, two different sets of samples were
stacked together for ﬂight. The ﬁrst set included the number of sample layers needed to be
stacked together and weighed to survive an A0 exposure period of 1.5 years. The second set
was the number of additional sample layers that should be added behind the weighed set to
ensure survival of a 3-year mission.

Because the MISSE experiment was planned as a 1-year mission, it was decided to choose a
mission time slightly longer than expected for sample weighing (hence 1.5 years for an expected
1-year mission). Therefore, based on the expected AO ﬂuenoe for a 1.5 year mission (computed
as 4.55><1021 atoms/omz), and an estimated erosion yield of each polymer, the number of layers
for each sample needed in order to survive 1.5 years of exposure was determined. The A0
ﬂuenoe for a 3-year mission was computed to be 9.1><1021 atoms/om2 (twice the 1.5-year
ﬂuenoe); therefore the total number of samples to be stacked together as one “ﬂight sample” was
calculated based on surViVing the 3-year ﬂuenoe. This additional “stacked” (un-weighed) set
was always placed behind the “weighed” set in the ﬂight hardware. For example, the estimated
erosion yield for cellulose acetate (CA) is 6.8><10'24 om3/atom [5]. Based on this erosion yield
and the computed AO ﬂuenoe, the estimated thickness loss for 1.5 years in LEO is 0.031 cm.
The sample thickness is only 0.005 cm, and therefore 7 sample layers needed to be stacked for
mass measurements. A total of 0.062 cm was expected to be eroded away after 3 years, so 13
total layers needed to be stacked for ﬂight (the 7 weighed samples + 6 additional samples stacked
behind). In all, a total of 205 individual sample layers were ﬂown.

For each complete ﬂight sample, an identical baok—up sample was prepared and characterized.
A11 individual sample layers were carefully scribe marked at the edges indicating sample ID,
orientation (front), ﬂight or baok—up sample and whether the sample had been vacuum heat
treated.

4.3 Outgassing & Vacuum Heat Treatment

Samples to be ﬂown in the space environment need to meet outgas requirements as outlined in
ASTM E 595, the Standard Test Method for Total Mass Loss and Collected Volatile
Condensable Materials from Outgassing in a Vacuum Environment [6]. This test method
evaluates, under carefully controlled conditions, the changes in the mass of a test specimen on
exposure under vacuum to a temperature of 125 OC (total mass loss (TML)), and the mass of
those products that leave the specimen and condense on a collector plate at a temperature of
25 OC (collected volatile oondensable materials (CVCM)) [6]. MISSE management decided that
material being ﬂown as part of MISSE should meet the historical screening levels of <1.00%
TML and <0.10% CVCM. Ten of the 41 PEACE polymers did not meet the outgas requirements
either based on previous testing or because they had not been tested, and it was decided that
these polymers could be ﬂown if they were vacuum heat treated prior to ﬂight to remove volatile
products. Vacuum heat treatment was conducted at the NASA Marshall Space Flight Center
(MSFC) at a pressure of 5 ><10'7 torr (7><10'5 Pa). Ideally, samples were to be vacuum baked for
24 hours at 125 OC (similar to ASTM E 595), but some polymers were heated at lower
temperatures due to low maximum operating temperatures. Table 2 lists the vacuum heat treated

The polymer PBI (2-E5-35) curled severely at its edges during vacuum heat treatment. For this
polymer, 4 individual sample layers needed to be stacked in order to survive a 3-year exposure.
Therefore, the 4 layers were stacked together (after mass measurements were obtained) and held
ﬂat by mounting them in an aluminum holder for ﬂight (similar to the one used for the Kevlar
fabric).
4.4 Pre-ﬂight Dehydrated Mass Measurements
A11 pre-ﬂight mass measurements were obtained for dehydrated sample sets and after vacuum
heat treatment were applicable. A11 sample sets were dehydrated in a vacuum desiccator
maintained at a pressure of 60-100 mtorr with a mechanical roughing pump. Typically 5 ﬂight
sample sets and their corresponding back—up sets were placed together in a desiccator (a total of
10 groups of samples). The sets of samples were placed in the desiccator in a particular order
and left under vacuum for a minimum of 4 days. The exact time that each sample was under
vacuum was recorded. In order to maintain each sample under vacuum while weighing other
samples, the vacuum desiccator would be put back under vacuum immediately after an
individual sample was removed. The time at which the sample was removed from the desiccator
was recorded along with the times at which it was weighed (a total of 3 readings were obtained
and averaged). Previous tests showed that the mass of a dehydrated sample was not adversely
affected if the desiccator was opened and quickly closed again and pumped back down to
approximately 150 mtorr prior to that sample being weighed. This process allows multiple
samples to be dehydrated together. The samples were weighed using either a Mettler Balance
3M (0.001 mg) or a Sartorius Balance R160P (0.00001 g), depending on their total mass.
Records of the following were kept: the sequence of sample weighing, the number of samples in
each set, the time under vacuum prior to weighing, the temperature and humidity in the room, the
time a sample was taken out of the desiccator, the time of each weighing and the mass. The
same procedure and sequence was repeated with the same samples post-ﬂight.

"12","4.5 Density Data

Density measurements were obtained for 36 of the 41 polymers using calibrated density gradient
columns. The density solvents for the majority of polymers were made from cesium chloride
(CsCl), which has a density of z2 g/cm3, and water (H20), which has a density of 1 g/cm3. A
more dense solution and a less dense solution were mixed from the solvents, and the more dense
solution was slowly added to a 50 mL buret with increasing amounts of the less dense solution
until only the less dense solution was being added, creating the density gradient. Because of the
variation of density in the polymers, columns with variations in the initial mixed solutions were
made to accommodate a wider range of densities to be determined. Density standards of known
densities (i 0.0001 g/crn3) were placed in the column. Data was obtained by placing very small
pieces of the polymers into the column and noting their respective positions. The sample
densities were then obtained from a curve ﬁtted from the standards. As one example, for a
density column with a density range of 1.4-1.6 g/cm3, the more dense solution was made with a
density of 1.65 g/cm3 (13 mL CsCl & 7 mL of H20) and the less dense solution was made with a
density of 1.38 g/cm3 (38 mL CsCl & 62 mL of H20). The density solvents for the higher
density polymers, such as the ﬂuoropolymers, were carbon tetrachloride (CC14), which has a
density of 1.594 g/cm3, and bromoform (CHBr3), which has a density of 2.899 g/cm3. The
densities for polymers either out of the range of the density columns or of a form not easily
sectioned for density column measurements were obtained from either referenced literature
and/or manufacturers” Materials Safety and Data Sheets.

4.6 Area Measurements

The exposed sample area was determined by measuring the diameter of the sample tray opening
using digital calipers. Each speciﬁc tray opening was measured at 10 different positions to
determine an average diameter. This diameter was then used to compute the sample area
exposed to LEO A0 for each sample position.

5. FLIGHT SAMPLE MOUNTING (TRAY E5)

The MISSE PEACE Polymers resided in sample tray E5, which holds a total of 46 1-in.-diameter
ﬂight samples. The PEACE Polymer samples start in the top row, 6th sample position from the
left (i.e. ABS, with serial number 2-E5-6, represents a sample in MISSE Passive Experiment
Container (PEC) 2, tray E5, sample position 6). Five other samples (4 DC 93-500 silicone
samples and 1 A0 scattering chamber) were also on this tray, in positions 2-E5-1 through
2-E5-5. Sample positions were chosen based on their anticipated erosion yields or by grouping
samples by polymer family (such as the polyimides). High erosion yield samples were located
next to the silicone samples as the high erosion yield samples are less likely to be affected by

6. MATERIALS INTERNATIONAL SPACE STATION EXPERIMENT (MISSE)
Managed by Langley Research Center (LaRC), MISSE is a collaborative effort among NASA
centers, the US. Air Force and private industry [7]. MISSE consists of suitease-like experiment
trays exposed to either A0 and solar radiation, or solar radiation with minimal AO exposure,
along with charged particle radiation and vacuum 011 the exterior of 188. The PEACE Polymers
were located 011 PEC 2 tray 1, exposed to A0 along with solar and charge particle radiation.
MISSE 1 & 2 were transported to the ISS, and MISSE 2 was attached to the exterior Quest
Airlock 011 August 16, 2001 during the STS-105 shuttle mission. Fig. 2 is a photograph of
MISSE PEC 2 0n the ISS Quest Airlock just after attachment. The MISSE 2 PEACE Polymers
tray is Visible in this photograph. Fig. 3 is a photograph of the Quest Airlock showing the
location of MISSE PEC 2. MISSE 1 & 2 were the ﬁrst exterior experiments on the ISS hull.
Although originally planned as a 1-year mission, retrieval of MISSE 1 & 2 was signiﬁcantly
delayed due to the Columbia Shuttle accident. MISSE 1 & 2 were successfully retrieved during
a space walk on July 30, 2005 during Discovery’s STS-114 Return to Flight mission after nearly
4 years of space exposure.

7. MISSE 2 ENVIRONMENTAL EXPOSURE
The atomic oxygen ﬂuence exposure for the MISSE 2 PEACE Polymers is described in Section
8 below. Estimated environmental conditions of solar exposure, tray temperatures, and ionizing
radiation doses on MISSE l & 2 are described in detail by Pippin [8]. For PEC 2 tray (exposed
to A0 and solar radiation) the total equivalent sun hours (ESH) was estimated to be 5,000 —
6,700 ESH. This total includes Earth-reﬂected illumination (650-820 ESH). The spectrum of
Earth reﬂection solar radiation has a reduced contribution from the vacuum ultraviolet (UV)
portion of the spectrum due to absorption by the Earth's atmosphere [8]. Tray E5 was computed
to have received approximately 6,300 ESH. Pippin also describes the base plate thermal cycling
temperature range for MISSE l & 2 to be nominally between +40 OC and -30 0C with occasional
short-term excursions to more extreme temperatures. The almost 4-year duration resulted in
approximately 22,800 thermal cycles. Preliminary data from [8] also provided insight into the
ionizing radiation environment on MISSE l & 2. Data from thermo-luminescent dosimeters
(TLDs) with thin shielding layers are most relevant to estimates of doses for the PEACE
Polymer experiment thin polymer ﬁlms. The TLD data indicated receiving approximately 16
krads(Si) through 0.005 cm aluminum for MISSE 2 [8].
Black light inspection of the trays showed minimal to no contamination on the MISSE surfaces
[8]. Results of X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) contamination analysis of two MISSE 2
sapphire witness samples in tray E6 (located next to tray E5) indicated an extremely thin silica
contaminant layer (1.3 and 1.4 nm on each slide, respectively) [9]. A small amount of ﬂuorine
was also detected [9].

Fig. 4 is a post-retrieval photograph of the PEACE Polymers experiment tray as observed
directly after PEC 2 was opened for the ﬁrst time in a NASA Langley Research Center clean

of eroding through the various sample layers was evident. Fig. 5 is a post-ﬂight photograph of
the PEACE Polymers experiment (tray E5) after de-integration from MISSE PEC 2.

Fortunately, even though this experiment received nearly 4 years of atomic oxygen exposure,
material was left for all samples except for one (PBI, 2-E5-35). Therefore, planning for a 3 year
exposure (vs. 1 yr) was found to be crucial to the experiment success.

"16","Once tray E5 was brought back to NASA Glenn Research Center, post-ﬂight photo-
doeumentation of the samples was conducted. Photos were taken of the individual samples in
tray E5 after removal from the tray (left in a ﬂight stack next to the back—up stack), and also with
the individual sample layers spread out. Details on the number of sample layers eroded through,
those textured, and the number remaining non-eroded were recorded. When additional stacked
layer sets had been placed behind the weighed sample set as a ﬂight sample, those two groups of
sample sets were separated for weighing as individual sets. Post-ﬂight, an ideal situation would
be where only the weighed set had erosion, so that the un-weighed stacked layers do not need to
be weighed post-ﬂight for erosion yield determination. Occasionally, the individual layers could
not be separated from each other without damaging the sample texture or losing gossamer pieces
of residual material. In these cases all layers were kept together for post-ﬂight sample weighing.
For post-ﬂight mass measurements, there were three situations: 1). Either a stacked set of sample
layers was ﬂown behind the weighed set with erosion only occurring within the weighed set
(hence post-ﬂight the stacked set did not need to be weighed), or only a single sample layer was
ﬂown. These ideal situations are referred to as the “Single” situation. 2). Both a weighed set and
a stacked set were ﬂown with erosion occurring through the weighed set down into the stacked
set, and the two sets of layers could be separated and weighed individually post—ﬂight (this is
referred to as the “Separate” situation). Or, 3). Both a weighed set and a stacked set were ﬂown
with erosion occurring through the weighed set down into the stacked set, and the two sets of
layers could not be separated post-ﬂight without damaging the gossamer sample layers, and
therefore the sample sets were weighed together post-ﬂight (this is referred to as the “Together”
situation).
The post-ﬂight mass procedures replicated the pre-ﬂight mass procedures in terms of the vacuum
dehydration process (dehydration time, sample order, weighing technique) as often as possible.
Figs. 6, 7 and 8 provide examples of the “Single” situation. In Fig. 6 a single thick (0.203 cm)
layer of pyrolytie graphite (PG, 2-E5-25) was ﬂown and the ﬂight sample is shown post—ﬂight
next to the non-ﬂown control sample. Mass loss was therefore computed simply from the
dehydrated mass prior to, and after ﬂight, of this single layer.

shown in Figure 8 along with the back—up sample. Pre-ﬂight, the top six of 11 layers were
weighed. During ﬂight only the top 4 layers were eroded (the top 2 completely eroded leaving
the E5 tray-protected ring, the 3rd layer was eroded with holes at the AO textured cone valleys,
and the 4th layer was eroded at the cone valley hole locations in the 3rd layer). Therefore, post-
ﬂight, the top 6 layers were separated from the bottom 5 layers and only the top set was weighed
and directly compared to the mass of the top 6 layers pre-ﬂight for ﬂight experiment mass loss.

"18","Atomic oxygen ﬂuenee witness sample Kapton H (2-E5-30) provides an example of a “Separate”
situation. As shown in Fig. 9, three 0.0127 cm thick layers were ﬂown. Prior to ﬂight only the
top 2 layers were weighed. During ﬂight, AO eroded the top layer completely and eroded the 2nd
layer resulting in the development of the cone-like texture. In the bottom of the valleys between
the cones there were holes providing exposure to the sample layer below. Even though the 2nd
layer was still intact (and could be weighed as a separate layer), the 3rd layer was also textured.
Therefore, in this case, pre-ﬂight and post-ﬂight mass measurements are needed for both the
weighed top 2 layers and the bottom “un-weighed” layer.

Fig. 10 provides a schematic diagram of a situation where a stack of un-weighed layers has been
ﬂown behind a weighed layer set and during ﬂight AG has eroded through the weighed set into
the un-weighed set. In this situation, the pre-ﬂight mass of the stacked set (Ms) needed to be
computed. This mass was computed based on taking an average of both the weighed ﬂight set
(MF) and the weighed back—up sample set (MB) prior to ﬂight to get an individual layer average
and then multiplying that mass by the number of layers (11) in the un-weighed stack set. This
equation, along with the variables, is shown in Fig. 10.
9. MISSE 2 TRAY 1 E5 AO FLUENCE
The A0 ﬂuenee for PEC 2 tray 1 E5 was computed based on the mass loss of two Kapton H
witness samples (2-E5-30 & 2-E5-33). Each Kapton H witness sample consisted of three 127
pm thick layers for a total thickness of 381 pm. As stated previously, Kapton H is commonly
used for ﬂuenee calibration because it has a well-characterized erosion yield in LEO (3.0><10'24
atoms/emz) [4]. The A0 ﬂuenee was determined using vacuum-dehydrated mass loss based on 2

"19","techniques: 1). Averaging the 1St three mass readings, and 2). Back—extrapolation 0f the mass
data to time zero using linear curve ﬁts to get theoretically dehydrated mass values. The results
of these measurements are provided in Table 3. The A0 ﬂuence values for the individual
samples using the same technqiues were very similar. The average AO ﬂuenees for the two
techniques were also very similar. Therefore, it was decided to use the average mass value
instead of the linear back—extrapolation value for determining both the LEO AO ﬂuenee for the
experiment and for determining the erosion yield values for the individual PEACE Polymer
samples. The average AO ﬂuenee for the PEACE Polymers experiment exposure (tray E5) 011
MISSE 2, based on the two Kapton H witness samples (averaging the 1St three mass readings),
was determined to be 8.43><1021 atoms/cmz.

Table 4 provides the erosion yield data for the MISSE 2 PEACE Polymers experiment along
with the sample mass loss, density and exposure area. Six of the 41 samples were either fully or
partially eroded through (such as at one edge) after the 4 year mission. Therefore, the erosion

the following:

° 2-E5-9 PE (6 layers, 0.005 cm thick) eroded with residual material left

° 2-E5-14 ADC (1 layer, 0.079 cm thick) eroded at 1 edge, sample curled up

° 2-E5-16 PMMA (10 layers, 0.005 cm thick) eroded through in center, residual material left

° 2-E5-26 PEI (2 layers, 0.025 cm thick) textured back surface (AO valleys eroded through)

° 2-E5-34 PMR-15 (1 layer, 0.30 cm thick) eroded through at 1 edge

° 2-E5-35 PBI (14 layers, 0.005 cm thick) all 4 layers completely eroded away
11. FUTURE WORK
Error analyses will be conducted to determine the error in the erosion yield values for each of the
MISSE 2 PEACE Polymers ﬂight samples. A handbook will be published with speciﬁc details
on each of the individual ﬂight samples. The MISSE 2 PEACE Polymers erosion yield values
will eventually be compared with erosion yield values from the MISSE 5 PEACE Polymers
experiment, currently being exposed to atomic oxygen with minimum solar radiation on the
exterior of 188, so that synergistic effects of solar exposure on AO erosion yield can be
determined for long duration exposures.
12. SUMMARY & CONCLUSIONS
Forty-one different polymer samples, collectively called the PEACE Polymers, have been
exposed to the LEO space environment on the exterior of the 188 for nearly four years as part of
MISSE 2. The objective of this experiment was to accurately determine the atomic oxygen
erosion yield of a wide variety of polymeric materials after long term exposure to the space
environment. The MISSE 2 PEACE Polymers experiment was exposed to atomic oxygen along
with solar and charged particle radiation. Mass loss was determined to be the best technique for
characterizing the atomic oxygen erosion yield values for this experiment because erosion
sometimes occurred in underlying layers at “cone valleys” in partially eroded upper layers, and
because some layers were fragile gossamer films.
Atomic oxygen erosion yield values were determined for the MISSE 2 PEACE Polymers
experiment based on mass loss obtained from pre-ﬂight and post-ﬂight vacuum dehydrated
samples. Exposure areas were determined from individual ﬂight sample hardware openings.
Density values for 36 0f the 41 polymers were obtained using calibrated density gradient
columns. The A0 ﬂuenee for the experiment was determined based on two Kapton H witness
samples. Baek—extrapolation 0f the mass data to time zero (to get a theoretically dehydrated
mass) as compared to using the average mass values indicated no signiﬁcant difference in A0
ﬂuenee between these techniques. The average atomic oxygen ﬂuenee for the MISSE 2 PEACE
Polymers experiment (MISSE 2, tray 1, sample tray E5) was determined to be 8.43><1021
atoms/em2 based on average mass values. There was partial or complete erosion of 6 0f the 41
ﬂight samples, and hence the erosion yield values for these samples are greater than the value
reported. Planning for a 3 year exposure (vs. 1 yr) was found to be crucial to the success of this
experiment.
The MISSE 2 PEACE Polymers experiment is unique because it has the widest variety of
polymers ﬂown in LEO for a long duration under identical conditions and provides extremely
valuable erosion yield data for spacecraft design and predictive model development purposes.

13. ABSTRACT (Maximum 200 words)
Forty-one different polymer samples, collectively called the Polymer Erosion and Contamination Experiment (PEACE)
Polymers, have been exposed to the low Earth orbit (LEO) environment on the exterior of the International Space Station (188)
for nearly 4 years as part of Materials International Space Station Experiment 2 (MISSE 2). The objective of the PEACE
Polymers experiment was to determine the atomic oxygen erosion yield of a wide variety of polymeric materials after long term
exposure to the space environment. The polymers range from those commonly used for spacecraft applications, such as Teﬂon
(DuPont) FEP, to more recently developed polymers, such as high temperature polyimide PMR (polymerization of monomer
reactants).Additiona1 polymers were included to explore erosion yield dependence upon Chemical composition. The MISSE
PEACE Polymers experiment was ﬂown in MISSE Passive Experiment Carrier 2 (PEC 2), tray 1, on the exterior of the ISS
Quest Airlock and was exposed to atomic oxygen along with solar and Charged particle radiation. MISSE 2 was successfully
retrieved during a space walk on J uly 30, 2005, during Discovery’s STS—l 14 Return to Flight mission. Details on the specific
polymers ﬂown, ﬂight sample fabrication, pre-ﬂight and post-ﬂight Characterization techniques, and atomic oxygen ﬂuence
calculations are discussed along with a summary of the atomic oxygen erosion yield results. The MISSE 2 PEACE Polymers
experiment is unique because it has the widest variety of polymers ﬂown in LEO for a long duration and provides extremely
valuable erosion yield data for spacecraft design purposes.
