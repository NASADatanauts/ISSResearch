As part of the Matroshka-R experiments, a spherical phantom and space bubble detectors (SBDs) were used on board the
International Space Station to characterise the neutron radiation ﬁeld. Seven experimental sessions with SBDs were carried
out during expeditions 188-13, 188-14 and 188-15. The detectors were positioned at various places throughout the Space
Station, in order to determine dose variations with location and on/in the phantom in order to establish the relationship
between the neutron dose measured externally t0 the body and the dose received internally. Experimental data on/ in the
phantom and at different locations are presented.

polymer so that the growth of the formed bubbles is
slower, allowing the detector to be used for a longer
period between recompressions. The detectors have
an active volume of 10 ml with ~104 microscopic
droplets giving a low sensitivity from 140 to 200
bubbles per mSV (for neutrons from an ArnBe
source). The bubble counting was done automatically
using a lightweight mini reader. A total of 16 bubble
detectors were launched aboard the Progress M-356
in April 2006. Each detector’s exposure was for N5
days with counting immediately after exposure. A
photograph of the SBD is shown in Figure 1.
The spherical phantom to simulate the human
body is 350 mm in diameter, 32 kg in mass and has
13 tissue-equivalent slices (see Figure 2). A working
jacket with 32 pockets and radial holes was designed
to facilitate the mounting of detectors 0n the surface
_. and insertion inside the phantom at a depth of 105—
165 mm, to approximate the measured dose in criti-
cal organs. Preliminary data obtained with this
phantom were reported in reference (3).
EXPERIMENTAL SETUP
Measurements were carried out over three
‘0’"" I expeditions (188-13, 188-14 and ISS—15) with two to
- ' three sessions each. During these sessions, the bubble
detectors were placed at various locations on board
