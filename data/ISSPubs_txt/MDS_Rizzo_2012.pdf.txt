Abstract
Erythrocyte and hemoglobin losses have been frequently observed in humans during space missions; these observations
have been designated as ”space anemia”. Erythrocytes exposed to microgravity have a modified rheology and undergo
hemolysis to a greater extent. Cell membrane composition plays an important role in determining erythrocyte resistance
to mechanical stress and it is well known that membrane composition might be influenced by external events, such as
hypothermia, hypoxia or gravitational strength variations. Moreover, an altered cell membrane composition, in particular
in fatty acids, can cause a greater sensitivity to peroxidative stress, with increase in membrane fragility. Solar radiation or
low wavelength electromagnetic radiations (such as gamma rays) from the Earth or the space environment can split water
to generate the hydroxyl radical, very reactive at the site of its formation, which can initiate chain reactions leading to lipid
peroxidation. These reactive free radicals can react with the non-radical molecules, leading to oxidative damage of lipids,
proteins and DNA, etiologically associated with various diseases and morbidities such as cancer, cell degeneration, and
inflammation. Indeed, radiation constitutes on of the most important hazard for humans during Iong-term space flights.
With this background, we participated to the MDS tissue-sharing program performing analyses on mice erythrocytes
flown on the ISS from August to November 2009. Our results indicate that space flight induced modifications in cell
membrane composition and increase of lipid peroxidation products, in mouse erythrocytes. Moreover, antioxidant
defenses in the flight erythrocytes were induced, with a significant increase of glutathione content as compared to both
Vivarium and ground control erythrocytes. Nonetheless, this induction was not sufficient to prevent damages caused by
oxidative stress. Future experiments should provide information helpful to reduce the effects of oxidative stress exposure
and space anemia, possibly by integrating appropriate dietary elements and natural compounds that could act as
antioxidants.
