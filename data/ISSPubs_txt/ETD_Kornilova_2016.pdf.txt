Abstract—This study presents the results of the pre— and postﬂight clinical and physiological examination

(CPE) and scientiﬁc experiment “Sensory Adaptation—Z” at the Gagarin Research and Test Cosmonaut

Training Center, which involved 14 Russian cosmonauts, crewmembers of long—term international space—

ﬂights ISS—28/29 to 138 36/37, who were in microgravity from 159 to 195 days. The cosmonauts were aged

35—50 years. The studies were conducted twice before the spaceﬂight (the background), as well as on days

R+1(2), R+4(5), and R+8(9) after landing. In the study of Visual—manual tracking (WT), eye movements

were recorded by the electrooculography method (ECG), and hand movements were recorded by a joystick

(the screen represented the current tilt angle of a joystick handle). The examinations were conducted using

stimulation computer programs, were presented to an examined subject on the screen of the Sensomotor

hardware—software complex. The examinations took place in the dialog mode and included the ECG cali—

bration; WVIT within i10O 0n the screen with blank background (the smooth linear and sinusoidal movement

of a point target with a frequency of 0.16 Hz in the vertical and horizontal directions). The study estimated

the time, amplitude, and velocity characteristics of Visual and manual tracking (VT and MT), including the

effectiveness (ec) and gain (gc) coefﬁcients as the ratios of the amplitude and velocity of eye/hand movements

to the amplitude and velocity of the Visual stimulus. The study of the vestibular function (VF) was performed

before and after the spaceﬂight using Videooculography. The static torsion otolith—cervical—ocular reﬂex

(OCOR), dynamic yestibular—cervical—ocular reactions (VCOR), vestibular reactivity, and spontaneous eye

movements were assessed. The study of VF in the ﬁrst postﬂight days has shown a sharp decrease (up to its

complete absence) of static vestibular excitability accompanied by the increased dynamic reactivity of the yes—

tibular system. The study ofVTM in the ﬁrst postﬂight days has shown a signiﬁcant decrease in the ec and go

of VT as well as correlations between the parameters of VT and MT and between the parameters of VF and

VT and has not found a correlation between the parameters ofVF and MT The conditions of the spaceﬂight

have been revealed to affect the accuracy ofVT more strongly than the accuracy of MT A complete return of

the characteristics OfWT and VF t0 the baseline was observed on R+8(9) days after the spaceﬂight.
