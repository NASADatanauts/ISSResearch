The hard sphere disorder-order transition serves as the paradigm for crystallization. However, measure-
ments of the crystallization kinetics for colloidal hard spheres in the coexistence regime are incomplete
for early times and are affected by sedimentation. We use time resolved Bragg light scattering to Char-
acterize crystal nucleation and growth in a microgravity environment on the space shuttle. In contrast to
the Classical picture of the nucleation and growth of isolated crystallites, we ﬁnd substantial coarsening
of growing crystallites. We also Observe dendritic growth and face-centered cubic as the stable structure.
