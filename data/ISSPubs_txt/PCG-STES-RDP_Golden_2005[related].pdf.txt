Crystal structure of a phage Twort gro up I ribozyme—

Barbara 1. Golden, Hajeong Kim 8( Elaine Chase 6
Group I introns are catalytic RNAs capable of orchestrating two sequentiaI phOSphotransesteriﬁcation reactions that result in self— i
sptieing. To understand how the group I intron active site facilitates catalysis, we have solved the structure of an active ribozyme 1
derived from the art 14242 intron from phage Twort bound to a four-nucleotide product RNA at a resolution of 3.6 A. In addition :
to the three conserved domains characteristic of all group I introns, the Twort ribozyme has peripheral insertions characteristic of
phage introns. These elements form a ring that completely envelops the active site, where a snug pocket for guanosine is formed
by .1 series of stacked base triples. The structure of the active site reveals three potential binding sites for catalytic metals, and
invokes .1 role for the 2’ hydroxyl of the guanosine substrate in organization of the active site for catalysis. i
