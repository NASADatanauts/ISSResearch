Nightsat is a concept for a satellite system capable of global observation of the
location, extent and brightness of night—time lights at a spatial resolution suitable
for the delineation of primary features within human settlements. Based on
requirements from several fields of scientific inquiry, Nightsat should be capable
of producing a complete cloud—free global map of lights on an annual basis. We
have used a combination of high—resolution ﬁeld spectra of outdoor lighting,
moderate resolution colour photography of Cities at night from the International
Space Station, and high—resolution airborne camera imagery acquired at night to
define a range of spatial, spectral, and detection limit options for a future
Nightsat mission. The primary findings of our study are that Nightsat should
collect data from a near—synchronous orbit in the early evening with 50 to 100 m
spatial resolution and have detection limits of 2.5E_8Watts C111_2S1‘_lum_l or
better. Although panchromatic low—light imaging data would be useful,
multispectral low—light imaging data would provide valuable information on

the type or character of lighting; potentially stronger predictors of variables, such
'5 as ambient population density and economic activity; and valuable information
8 to predict response of other species to artificial night lighting. The Nightsat
g mission concept is unique in its focus on observing a human activity, in contrast
qEJ to traditional Earth observing systems that focus on natural systems.

E 1. Introduction
8 Nocturnal lighting is a unique indicator of human activity that can be measured
3 from space. A new satellite sensor for night-time lighting, Nightsat, could be used to
E map the extent and Character of development more accurately and completely than
g” most currently available tools. Improved global mapping of human settlements and
E human activity would address a variety of science and policy issues in the 21st
8 eentury—an era in which human population numbers are expected grow
3 substantially from the current 6+ billion mark.
g The density of infrastructure and the intensity of human aetivity—or
g ‘urbanness’—Can be Viewed as a continuum, ranging from wilderness at one
0% extreme to central business districts at the other extreme (Weeks 2004, Weeks 61 a1.
5‘ in press). Human beings worldwide tend to Cluster in spatially limited habitats,
g occupying less than 5% of the world’s land area. Today, more than half of the
:3 world’s population lives in urban areas, with the most rapid increases occurring in
g the developing countries of Latin America, Asia and Africa. In Europe, North
8 America and Japan 80% or more of the population already live in urban areas.
Worldwide, the trend is for increasing numbers of people to concentrate in
settlements and for the settlements to expand at their perimeters. Sprawl on the
urban fringe and exurban development are two of the more conspicuous signs of
urban change, but structural change permeates urban areas through continuous re-
development and the replacement of ageing infrastueture with new construction.
Thus, urban areas are in a constant state of re-development and ﬂux that reﬂect
both, growing urban populations and the evolution of urbanizing technologies.
Interest in satellite remote sensing of nocturnal lighting stems, in part, from the
difficulty in global mapping of human settlements in a repeatable, timely manner
from traditional sources. Although development features can be extracted from high
spatial resolution (~1 n1) satellite imagery, the production of global annual maps of
development from these data sources is not feasible (at this time) from either a
collection or analysis perspective. Moderate resolution Landsat-style systems offer
the potential of global collections on an annual basis and such data have been used
effectively for mapping urban areas and tracking growth in local settings. Recent
analyses of Landsat data from diverse urban areas worldwide indicate, however,
that the combination of inter-urban and intra-urban heterogeneity precludes the
existence of any unique spectral Characteristic of urban areas as a thematic Class
(Small 2005). The spectral complexity and classiﬁcation ambiguities of Landsat-style
data contribute to the lengthy production period typical for continental to global-
seale derived products from these sources. For example, both the USGS National
Land Cover Data (NLCD) for the USA (Vogelmann er a1. 2001) and NASA’s global
Geoeover Land Cover products required ﬁve years to complete. In addition,
Landsat-style data are poorly suited for the detection of sparse development.
In contrast, the remote sensing of nocturnal lighting provides an accurate,
economical, and straightforward way to map the global distribution and density of
developed areas. The widespread use of outdoor lighting is a relatively recent

phenomenon, tracing its roots back to the electric light bulb, commercialized by
'5 Thomas Edison in the early 1880s. Nocturnal lighting has emerged as one of the
§ hallmarks of modern development and provides a unique attribute for identifying
8 the presence of development or human activity that can be sensed remotely.
E; Although there are some cultural variations in the quantity and quality of lighting in
g various countries, there is a remarkable level of similarity in lighting technology and
R: lighting levels around the world. The primary factor affecting the quantity of
g lighting is wealth. Regions with high per capita income have much more lighting
9 than regions with low per capita income. Even within afﬂuent regions, however,
5 lighting technology (lamps and lighting fixtures) is gradually changing, as pressure is
E applied to reduce night-time sky brightness and conserve energy. In some
:5 applications, night-time lights are used as a proxy for variables that are difficult
3', to measure in a globally consistent manner, including many socio-economie
:52 variables, such as population density and gross domestic product (e.g. Doll 61 a1.
'03 2000, Balk er al. 2005). In other applications, the spatial distribution and quality of
E lighting is used as a variable directly, as in the detection of biolumineseenee (Miller
i 61 al. 2005) and analyses of ecological effects of nocturnal lighting (see chapters in
0'? Rich and Longcore 2006), the analysis of artificial sky brightness impacts on the
8 Visibility of stars and planets, and human health effects of lighting (Hansen 2001,
IS? Pauley 2004, Stevens and Rea 2001).
E The only satellite sensor currently collecting global night-time lights data is the
8 U.S. Air Force Defense Meteorological Satellite Program (DMSP) Operational
Linescan System (OLS). The NOAA National Geophysical Data Center (NGDC)
has been producing DMSP night-time lights products since 1994 and has worked
extensively with the scientific community to develop applications for this data
source. As a result of these efforts, it can be concluded that the current technology
for global mapping of night-time lights falls short of the science community’s
requirements. The objective of this paper is to reView the science community’s
requirements for global satellite observations of nocturnal lighting and to define a
Nightsat mission concept to address these requirements. Most of the scientific
applications for satellite-observed night-time lights could be addressed by a system
capable of producing an annual Cloud-free night-time lights composite that is
radiance calibrated and collected in spectral bands that are linked to standards used
in lighting technology.
2. Current status
Since the early 1970s the U.S. Air Force Defense Meteorological Satellite Program
has operated polar orbiting platforms, carrying Cloud imaging satellite sensors
capable of detecting clouds using two broad spectral bands: Visible—near
infrared (VNIR) and thermal infrared (TIR). The program began with the SAP
(sensor aerospace vehicle electronics package), which were ﬂown from 1970—76. The
current generation of OLS sensors began ﬂying in 1976 and are expected to continue
ﬂying until at least 2010. At night, the VNIR band is intensified with a
photomultiplier tube to permit detection of clouds illuminated by moonlight. The
OLS detects radianees down to the 5E_10Wattsen1_2sr_1 range (Table1), which
makes it possible to detect artificial sky brightness surrounding large Cities and gas
ﬂares.
A digital archive for the DMSP—OLS data was established in mid-1992 at NGDC.
In 1994, NGDC began developing algorithms for producing annual global Cloud-

Landsat ETM Area Inn1
Figure 1. The area of lights measured by DMSP—OLS versus the area of the corresponding
light sources derived from Landsat ETM+ data. Spatial extents of both the OLS lights and
developments observed in the Landsat data were extracted Visually.
In working with the science community using the annual composites of DMSP
night-time lights, certain Characteristics of the products were identiﬁed that limited
the utility of the data. The OLS generates low-light imaging data with a 2.7-km
ground sample distance and the ground instantaneous ﬁeld of View at nadir is
approximately 5km. As a consequence of the coarse spatial resolution and the
accumulation of geoloeation errors in the eompositing process, the OLS-derived
night-time lights cover much larger areas than the lit areas on the ground (ﬁgure 1
and Small er a1. 2005). In addition, the scattering of light in the atmosphere and the
photomultiplier’s response to bright emission sources results in an ‘overglow’ effect
in OLS night-time lights. This overglow is conspicuous at gas ﬂares and offshore
from major urban centres (figure 2). Higher spatial resolution would be required to
unambiguously separate the spatially diffused overglow arising from artificial sky
brightness from lighting emitted directly from development present on the ground.
Additionally, the DMSP lights cannot be used to analyse differences in lighting type

or to discriminate sub-kilometer variations in lighting, are typically saturated in
urban centres, and have uncertain radiometry.
Based on these results, eleven specific shortcomings for the observation of night-
time lights have been identiﬁed for the OLS sensor: (a) coarse spatial resolution; (b)
lack of on-board calibration; (C) lack of systematic recording of in-ﬂight gain
changes; (d) limited dynamic range; (e) siX-bit quantitization; (0 signal saturation in
urban centres resulting from standard operation at the high gain setting; (g) lack of a
thermal band suitable for ﬁre detection; (h) limited data recording and download
capabilities (most OLS data are averaged on-board to enable download of global
coverage); (i) lack of a well Characterized point spread function (PSF); (j) lack of a
well Characterized field-of-View (FOV); and (k) lack of multiple spectral bands
capable of detecting lights.
The follow-on for the OLS is the Visible/infrared imager/radiometer suite (VIIRS),
Which Will ﬂy on the national polar-orbiting operational environmental satellite system
(NPOESS). The first VIIRS is currently being built and represents an improved
(table 1), but still imperfect, instrument to measure nocturnal lighting (Lee et al. 2004).
The NPOESS VIIRS instrument Will provide low-light imaging data With improved
spatial resolution (0.742 km), Wider dynamic range, higher quantitization, on-board
calibration, and simultaneous observation With a broader suite of bands for improved
Cloud and ﬁre discrimination over the OLS. The VIIRS is not, however, designed With

the objective of sensing night-time lights. Rather, it has the objective of night-time
'5 Visible band imaging of moonlit Clouds—the same mission objective of the OLS low-
§ light imaging. While the VIIRS will acquire improved night-time lighting data, it is not
8 optimal for this application. In particular, the VIIRS low-light imaging spatial
E; resolution will be too coarse to permit the observation of key night-time lighting
g features within human settlements and the spectral band to be used for the low-light
R1 imaging is not tailored for night-time lighting.

3 3. Observational requirements
i The environmental and social science applications described above have a
E substantial overlap in their night-time lights product requirements. Thus, a suite
3 of product types can be defined that satisfy multiple user communities. The largest
é numbers of potential users are those focused on human settlements. Below is a
:| listing of a basic product suite for human settlements that could potentially be
5 derived from night-time lights. Because of the rapid changes ongoing in human
0% settlements worldwide, these key global datasets would ideally be updated annually
: with a product latency of not more than one year for measurement of the rates of
3 change and annual growth increments.
g (1) Products depicting the geographic “footprints” of human settlements of all
E sizes. This includes the outline of the developed areas and specific estimates
8 of constructed area.
(2) Location and extent of sparse development in rural areas.
(3) Identification of intra-urban Classes, such as residential areas, commercial
and industrial areas, and open lands with little or no development present.
(4) Vectors for streets and roads.
Our assessment is that a low light imaging system optimized for deriving the listed
human settlement products would generate data suitable for a wider range of
applications, such as monitoring fishing boat activity, mapping the spatial
distribution of economic activity, or the analysis of ecological effects of nocturnal
lighting (Rich and Longeore 2006). The low-light imaging spectral, radiometric and
spatial resolution requirements for the extraction of the features listed above have
not been deﬁned to date.
4. Data collection
To explore the remote sensing of night-time lights, we have collected data on the
ground, from the air, and from space.
4.1 Field spectra of lights
A survey of the spectral information content of commonly used lighting sources was
conducted using high spectral resolution field spectra. Spectra were acquired of a
suite of outdoor lighting types, including streetlights (mercury vapour lamps and
high pressure sodium vapour lamps), incandescent lights from vehicles and homes,
and lights present at commercial and government facilities (ﬂuorescent, neon and
low-pressure sodium vapour lamps). Spectra were acquired using a portable
spectrometer manufactured by analytical spectral devices. The spectra were
collected as irradianees, while pointing the instrument head directly at each light
source.

4.2 Space photography
[\
é We investigated the feature content of moderate-resolution colour imagery of lights
'5, at night from space with digital photography acquired from the International
E Space Station (188). Astronauts have long marveled at the shear beauty and the
% technical information about the development of humanity from city lights at night
E as Viewed from orbit. However, the features have been difficult to photograph,
g owing to mismatches between the optimal exposure times and the velocity of the
3 spacecraft. During Expedition 6 (23 November 2002—3 May 2003) to the
Z International Space Station, a mechanized but manually driven image motion
<5 compensation mount was built from existing hardware and images were acquired
g of Cities at night all over the world through an optical-quality nadir-Viewing
3 window. Images were acquired of large urban areas and a number of sparsely
é populated areas. About 2000 images with dark currents and ﬂat field exposures
El, were collected.
g The orbital tracking mount consisted of the IMAX movie camera mount with
i both, a 70 mm film format (55 mm square image) Haselblad 203 camera with 350mm
0%. telephoto lens (a square field of View of 9 degrees) and a Kodak-Nikon 760 digital
8 camera with 58 mm, f1.2 nocto aspheric lens (see figure 3). A Makita drill driver was
'8 used to rotate a long threaded bolt that pushed against a wedge and drove one
% direction of gimbal at a smooth rate, determined by the degree that the trigger was
5% squeezed on the drill driver. The mount was attached to the 508 cm diameter, nadir
Viewing science window in the US Laboratory module so that the direction of
gimbal was aligned with the direction of orbital motion. In operation, the astronaut
would look through the Hasselblad camera, vary the rotation rate of the drill driver
until city lights were stationary with respect to the View ﬁnder reticule, and then take
the images using the Kodak-Nikon 760 digital camera. The ground sample distance
(GSD) of the imagery is 60m, however not all the images had the same degree of
sharpness, hence ground resolution owing to variations in effectiveness of the image
motion compensation.
4.3 Airborne photography
The spatial resolution and detection limit requirements for a Nightsat were
investigated using night-time Visible band digital imagery, acquired using a Cirrus
DSC camera (table1). The Cirrus camera was ﬂown on NASA’s ER-2 aircraft
across Las Vegas, Nevada and Los Angeles, California on 27 September 2004 at
13.7 km above sea level. Digital photography was acquired using an 80 mm lens and
a 1/60th s exposure. The Cirrus DCS is designed as a colour camera. For the night-
time collections the infrared blocking filter was removed and the signal from each of
the three bands were aggregated in post ﬂight processing to form panchromatic
imagery. The collections span desert areas devoid of lighting, cross a wide range of
development types, and encounter the world’s brightest light, emitted from the
Luxor Hotel and Casino in Las Vegas. The Luxor lighting installation is composed
of thirty-nine 7000 Watt xenon lamps, pointing straight up into the sky (figure 4).
The lighting installation intensity reaches 40 billion candelas. The spatial resolution
of the Cirrus camera data was 1.5 m at 16-bit quantitization. The Cirrus camera was
subsequently calibrated using an integrating sphere at the NASA Ames Research
Center.

5. Deﬁning requirements for Nightsat data
5.1 Spatial resolution requirements
To determine the spatial resolution necessary to adequately Characterize night-time
lights we analysed the 1.5m resolution night-time camera imagery. In the full
resolution imagery it is easy to distinguish major roads, commercial centres, dimly
lit residential neighbourhoods, and undeveloped tracts without lights (figure 5).
Acceptable spatial resolutions would retain these basic features. We used the 1.5 m
data to simulate imagery at resolutions of 25, 50, 100, 200 and 742m (figure 6). In
addition, we examined the ISS night-time photography of Cities at night. Figure7
shows two of the 188 images we examined, covering Chicago and Tokyo.

With the original Cirrus camera data (1.5m resolution), it is possible to detect
many individual lights in residential neighbourhoods, individual streetlights and a lit
area surrounding many of these lights. Lines of streetlights delineate many streets
and roads. Commercial buildings and commercial properties are lit much more
brightly than residential areas and can be readily distinguished. As the resolution is
degraded, finer detail is gradually lost, but most features, such as streets and roads,
are still evident at both 25 and 50 n1 resolution. At 100 m resolution, major forms are
still evident, such as major streets and roads and Clusters of commercial buildings.
At 200m resolution, very few features remain. At 742m resolution, the resolution
that will be provided by the VIIRS low-light imaging band, none of the features seen
so clearly in the original imagery can be discerned.

Figure 5. Airborne night—time lights imagery at 1.5 m resolution covering a portion of Las
Vegas, Nevada. Imagery acquired from NASA’s ER—2 ﬂown at 13.7 km above the Earth With
a Cirrus DCS digital camera.

Based on the spatial resolution simulations conducted With the Cirrus camera
imagery, we conclude that 50 to 100m resolution would be necessary to retain the
primary night-time lights features present in urban and rural environments. These
findings are corroborated by the delineation of commercial centres and major roads
With the ~60m resolution 188 night-time photography (figure 7). Obviously, a
sensor capable of acquiring 25m low-light imaging data Will be physically larger,
more expensive, and have a higher data volume than a system providing 100m
resolution data. Overall, 50 to 60m resolution low-light imaging data appears to
strike the best balance, making it feasible to map urban forms and measure
development growth rates on an annual basis.

5.2 Low-light imaging spectral bands

Outdoor lighting sources can be divided into three primary types: ﬂames (light
produced by combustion), incandescent (light produced using heated ﬁlaments), and
vapour lamps (Where light is generated by electrically charged gases, e.g. mercury

include incandescent, mercury vapour lamps, high pressure sodium vapour lamps,
low pressure sodium vapour lamps, metal halide lamps and light-emitting diode
(LEDs). The various types of light sources have distinctive spectral signatures (see
figure 8).
There are several possible conﬁgurations and numbers of low-light spectral bands
that should be considered for a future NightSat mission. The minimal configuration
is for a single broad low-light imaging band designed to record radiances from a
Wide range of lighting types. A logical bandpass would be from 0.5 to 0.9 um
(commonly referred to as a panchromatic band), Which could be designed, based on
silicon detector technology and avoids the atmospheric scattering present in the blue
part of the spectrum (0.4 to 0.5 um) and the water absorption band centred at
0.95 um. This is the spectral band used for low-light imaging on the DMSP-OLS and
NPOESS-VIIRS. A NightSat With a single low-light imaging band, though
producing less informative data, would have advantages in terms of a simpler

design, lower costs, and potentially lower data volume and simpler data processing
g for product generation.
C: Collecting data with a set of low-light imaging bands, specifically tailored for night-
8 time lights, would be indispensable to (i) obtain quantities that can be related directly
in to international recognized measurements and standards for outdoor lighting, (ii)
2 define the predominant type or mixture of lighting present, and consequently (iii)
2:, detect changes in lighting type over time. In considering the bandpass options for a
8 multispeetral Nightsat, it is important to consider the characteristics of human Vision,
3 internationally recognized lighting standards, the spectral content of lighting sources,
E and the responses of other species to different spectra.
g With hyperspeetral low-light imaging, the full spectral complexity of artificial
,5 light sources could be observed. This would be the best approach for the mapping
8 of lighting types and how they change over time. AchieV1ng the detection limits
3 and spatial resolution requirements specified above with a hyperspeetral imager,
g however, would be a technological challenge that would increase the sensor size,
g data rates, and processing complexity. Given the magnitude of these challenges,
0% we propose that the first NightSat have from three to five low-light imaging
5‘ bands.
g Artiﬁcial night-time lighting design is based on the Visual sensation of the human
8 observer. The aim of photometry is to measure light in such a way that the result can
E be correlated with the Visual sensation to a normal human observer exposed to that
8 radiation. In 1979, Conference Generale des Poids et Mesures (CGPM 1979)
redefined the basic SI unit candela (Cd), formerly defined based on the radiation
from platinum at the temperature of its solidification, as ‘the luminous intensity, in a
given direction, of a source that emits monochromatic radiation of frequency
540 X 1012 hertz and that has a radiant intensity in that direction of (1/ 683) Watt per
steradian.’ In redeﬁning the candela, photometry merged with radiometry—a field
commonly used in remote sensing. To achieve the aim of photometry, one must
take into account the Characteristics of human Vision, i.e. its relative spectral
responsivity. The relative luminous efﬁciency function for photopie Vision—the
photopie band—was originally proposed by Gibson and Tyndall (1923) and was
adopted by the Commission International de l’Eelairage in 1924 (CIE 1924). The
photopie band, shown in ﬁgure9 has a bandpass (full width half maximum)
spanning from 0.51 to 0.61 um and has peak responsivity at 0.555 um. Although
the photopie band does not properly match the relative spectral responsivity of
human Vision (e.g. Judd 1951, Vos 1978, Stoekman and Sharpe 1999) it has been
widely adopted and remains an irrefutable standard in lighting science and
technology. The photopie band has been published by Comite International des
Poids et Mesures in 1982 (CIPM 1982) to supplement the 1979 definition of
candela and republished by CIE in 2004 (CIE 2004). More recently, it has been
adopted as an ISO standard (ISO 23539:2005). Photopic response is largely
determined by the properties of the population of cone photoreceptors, which lie
at the centre of the retinal region providing the most acute Vision, the fovea.
Night-time outdoor lighting has typical luminances (radiance in ISO photopie
band) on the order of 1 to 2ed/m2. In this range of luminances, the Vision response
is derived mainly from cones. Because artificial night-time lighting installations are
designed based on the photopie quantities (e.g. luminanees) prescribed by standard
rules or as required by customers, the photopie band is a key spectral band for
NightSat applications such as estimation of ambient population, the spatial

distribution of economic activity, and the measurement of development growth
rates.

The spectral responsivity of human Vision deviates significantly from the photopie
response at very low levels of luminance When rod photoreceptors became more
important than cones in determining the eye response. Vision With the retinal rods
alone, at luminances under about 0.01 cd/mz, is determined by the relative luminous
efficiency function for scotopic Vision (Le Grand 1951, Wyszecki and Stiles 1967). It
was defined by CIE in 1951 (CIE 1951), recognized by CIPM in 1976 and 1982
(CIPM 1976, 1982), and adopted by ISO in 2005 (ISO 23539:2005). The term
‘scotopie’ should not be mistaken for ‘night Vision’, Which can involve both, rods
and cones. It is much more restrictive because it applies to the rods alone. The
scotopic Vision generally occurs only in speciﬁc nocturnal situations recognizable
because no colours are seen but only an achromatic whitish-greenish sensation. The
scotopic band is the second standard band for physical photometry used in lighting
engineering. The scotopic band, shown in figure 9, spans from 0.454 to 0.549 am full
Width half maximum (FWHM) and has peak responsivity at 0.507 am. The scotopic
to photopie lumen ratio can be used to describe the whiteness of the light When more
accurate Chromaticity coordinates are not available. It is of particular interest for us
because (i) the ‘Whiteness’ 0f the light could be used as an additional estimator of
parameters, such as population density and economic activity, (ii) the scotopic to
photopie lumen ratio can be used to distinguish between the main Class of lamp
spectra (table 2), and (iii) the radiance in the scotopic band is fundamental to
compute the effects of light pollution on the scotopic Vision of the eye, i.e. for
observers in low luminosity conditions. As an example, luminous stars tends to be
seen With cones, in particular under bright skies, but pure, or almost pure, rod Vision
is responsible for the whitish starred sky that we see as background, in dark sites.

Based on these considerations, the seotopie band should be included with the
photopie band on a multispeetral Nightsat.

For improved discrimination of lighting types and changes in lighting types over
time, additional low-light imaging bands at wavelengths longer than the photopie
band could be defined. These additional low-light imaging bands would assist in
discrimination of lighting types with broad spectral emission, like incandescent (see
figure 8), metal halide (ﬂat broad spectra) and LED lamps. Radiance emissions from
incandescent lamps and ﬂames follow a blackbody emission pattern and are much
brighter in the near infra-red (NIR) than in the Visible. In contrast, emissions from
LED lamps are typically low in the NIR. There is a prominent sodium vapour
emission line at 0.82 um (see figure 8) for which a spectral band could be tailored.

To resolve the questions raised on the number of spectral bands that would be
required to discriminate major lighting types from space, we have examined a set of
colour images acquired from the ISS. Figure7 shows images from Chicago and
Tokyo. The orange lighting observed across most of Chicago arises from the
prominence of sodium vapour lights in many American cities. The greenish
appearing lights found in some neighbourhoods of Chicago are owing to mercury
vapour lamps. The lights in the Tokyo image are nearly all green, indicating the
widespread use of mercury vapour lamps. There are several shipyards on Tokyo Bay
lit with sodium vapour lamps.

The evidence from the ISS photography and the ability to separate lighting types,
based on the seotopie and photopie band (table 2), indicates that it would be
possible to distinguish major lighting types and changes in lighting type using three
low light imaging bands. For a system with three low-light imaging spectral bands,
we recommend: (a) the seotopie band from 0.454 to 0.549 um, (b) the photopie band
from 0.51 to 0.61 um and (e) a broad red and near-infrared band spanning from 0.61
to 0.9 um. Improvements in the spectral discrimination of lighting types could be

g 5.3 Low light imaging detection limits

0 In examining the Cirrus camera imagery, we found that the dimmest detectable
lighting had radianees in the range of 5E_5 Watts (:m—2 erlunfl. These areas were
generally lit terrain closely surrounding shielded lights. The signal-to-noise ratio
(SNR) for this lighting was about nine. Lighting from indiVidual poorly shielded
100-Watt incandescent bulbs present on the exteriors of recently constructed homes
produced measured radianees in the range of 1E_4 Watts (:m—2 sr_ lunf1 The Cirrus
camera saturated at radianees above 3.83E_3 Watts cm_2 sr_ 1um—1. The Luxor light
(figure 4) produced a 37m diameter circular zone of saturated pixels. Other small
areas of saturated data were found on large casinos near the Luxor. Since the Luxor
beacon is the brightest light on earth, this effectively defines the saturation radiance
for a Nightsat at approximately 2.5E_2Watts em_2sr_1um_1, a level suitable for
daylight imaging of the earth.

The night-time light features from the Cirrus camera imagery were compared
against 1 n1 Ikonos imagery acquired a week earlier. This examination revealed that
the Cirrus camera imagery detected lighting in most, but not all, areas of
development. The Cirrus camera was unable to detect lit surfaces more than about
10 n1 out from indiVidual streetlights. Examining the background DN (digital
number) values along transects from dark desert areas through the centre of the Las
Vegas Strip revealed that the Cirrus camera was unable to detect the broad region of
terrain lit by artiﬁcial night sky brightness inside of an urban centre. Likewise, the
Cirrus camera would have been unable to detect moonlit terrain if the data had been
collected under full moon conditions.

There is a growing trend for the installation of shielding on outdoor lighting, to
reduce light pollution and to conserve energy. Full cutoff shielding directs all of the
lighting towards the surface below, with no lighting emissions directed towards the
sky. It would be important to be able to detect the areas lit by well shielded lighting
installations out to illumination levels commonly prescribed for outdoor lighting.
Otherwise, implementation of currently available technology and continuation of

"
"20","The Nightsat mission concept 2663
the trend towards shielding could render a NightSat useless for the detection of
'5 widespread artificial lighting.
§ From these observations, it is eVident that are several detection limit options for a
8 NightSat sensor. The detection of lighting from commercial centres and streetlights
E: as widely configured today could be accomplished with a system having capabilities
2 comparable to the Cirrus digital camera system (DCS) camera, i.e. in the
2:, 1E_5 Watts 0111—2 sr_1um_1 range for the photopie band. Because the Cirrus camera
8 was unable to detect many areas of known lighting, it is recommended that the
3 Nightsat detection limits be substantially lower than those achieved by the Cirrus
E camera. It is estimated that detection of the terrain lit by shielded lights and sparse
g lighting in rural environments would require detection limits in the
_.'§ 2.5E_8Watts 0111—2 sr_1um_1 range in photopie band for a 50m pixel size.
2 Quantiﬁcation of lighting levels on terrain illuminated by artiﬁcial sky brightness
3 in and around urban centres would require detection limits in the
g 5E_10Wattsen1_2 sr_lunf1 range in photopie band.
g Based on these considerations we recommend the Nightsat’s minimal detectable
0% average spectral radiance in photopie band at 2.5E_8Watts em_2 sr_1um_1 with a
5‘ SNR of 10 and a saturation radiance of 2.5E_2Wattscm_2sr_1um_1. This
8 saturation radiance would make it possible for Nightsat to collect unsaturated
8 data, even during the daylight portion of the orbits. If a detection limit of
E 5E_10Wattsen1_2 sr_lunf1 could be achieved, it would be possible to analyse the
8 patterns of artificial sky brightness that surround major Cities. Given the engineering
challenge of achieving the recommended detection limits, it is clear that systems
capable of detecting light in the 2.5E_8Wattsen1_2 sr_1um_1 range would provide
quite useful data.

The question then arises, at what detection limit would a Nightsat begin to have a
capability to detect moonlit terrain? How would this affect the data quality and
processing of Nightsat data acquired under high lunar illumination conditions?
Lunar illuminanee depends mainly on the phase, the elevation of the moon above
the horizon, and atmospheric extinction. We can roughly calculate the magnitude
order of the maximum radiance observed from the satellite for a typical soil (20%
albedo) near full moon (0.3 IX), and an atmospheric transmission of 0.7. This
radiance is estimated to be 2E_8Watts em_2 sr_lunf1 in the photopie band. By
setting the Nightsat detection limits slightly above the sensitiVity required to detect
heaVily moonlit objects, the effects of lunar cycles on the Nightsat observations
would be reduced. For a sensor capable of detecting radianees in the
5E_10Wattsen1_2 sr_lunf1 range observations of dimly lit terrain would have
non-negligible errors, if measured during moonlight. The observed radiance of
moonlighted soil is comparable to the minimal radiance required to observe a dimly
lit road, even if the ratio between the luminanees of the road and the soil is around
15. In fact, a typical 8 m wide road ﬁlls 1/6 of a pixel with 50 n1 pixel size and it likely
has a uniformity of about 50%, whereas moonlight has a filling factor of 100% and a
uniformity of 100%. The lunar contribution could not be computed and subtracted,
unless detailed information about surface reﬂectance was available at the resolution
of the Nightsat data. In the absence of surface albedo, valid radiances could be
extracted from the upper end of the dynamic range (e.g. above
1E_6Watts 0111—2 sr_lunfl), thresholding out the dim lighting associated with
moonlit terrain. With this lunar thresholding approach, there would be some loss in
the detection of dim lighting associated sparse rural and exurban populations when

lunar illuminanee is high. It is clear that as with the OLS, the best night-time lights

g data would be collected on nights with little or no lunar illuminanee.

N

g 5.4 T hermal band

% Thermal band data would be essential for discrimination of Cloud-free areas

E observed with a NightSat. In addition, thermal band data would facilitate in the

g identiﬁcation of lighting produced from combustion (e.g. biomass burning and gas

3 ﬂares). The thermal band data could be provided from another sensor, if NightSat

2 were ﬂown on a multisensor platform. Otherwise, a NightSat would need to have at

<5 least one thermal band for use in Cloud and ﬁre discrimination. An examination of

e MODIS Airborne Simulator data collected over Los Angeles, California, indicates

E that a single thermal band in the 3 to 5 um region could be used for both, Cloud and

§ fire. The thermal band data should be co-registered with the low-light imaging band

1' data, but the spatial resolution could be somewhat coarser, perhaps in the 300 to

g 500m range.

i

0%” 5.5 Orbital requirements

g There are four primary issues to be considered for the orbit of a future NightSat

8 mission.

C

5 5.5.1 Global coverage. The orbit should permit the collection of global coverage

D from a single satellite. Achieving global coverage with a single satellite could only be
accomplished using a polar orbit.
5.5.2 Overpass time. Having a consistent overpass time would be important for
accurate change detections. In many regions of the world, outdoor lighting is
gradually turned off starting around 10 p.n1. Thus, the ideal overpass time would be
the middle of the evening, i.e. in the 8:30 to 10:00 pm. range. This time slot would
permit the observation of the maximum extent of lighting in regions where lights
may be gradually turned off as midnight approaches. An earlier overpass time
would result in reductions in data coverage, due to solar contamination present at
mid-to-high latitudes during the summer months. As with the requirement for global
coverage, the requirement for a consistent overpass time implies a polar orbit.
5.5.3 Low altitude. Achieving the spatial resolution and detection limit targets
defined above will require a specialized sensor, capable of collecting and processing
minute quantities of light. This would be easier—in terms of the sizing of the
sensor—from a lower altitude orbit than a higher altitude orbit.
5.5.4 Repeat cycle. Multiple collections would be required for most parts of the
world to ensure that a global Cloud-free annual composite could be produced. The
other factor to consider is the lunar cycle. Automated extraction of surface lighting
features would become complicated for a sensor capable of detecting moonlit terrain
(e.g. detection limits in the range of 2E_8Wattscm_2sr_1um_1). For example,
shadows would appear in the imagery where terrain or large buildings obstructed
moonlight. The lunar contribution to the signal and variations introduced by
shadowing would detract from the quality of NightSat data collected on nights when
lunar illumination is high. Therefore, it would be important to randomize the mix of
lunar conditions under which observations would occur during a year for any
particular location. The least desirable repeat cycle for a Nightsat would be 29 days,

"
"22","The Nightsat mission concept 2665

matching the synodie period of the Moon (29.5305 89 days on average). With this
'5 type of orbit, orbital strips would be acquired at nearly the same lunar phase
C: throughout the year. L1kew1se, a repeat cycle period of 15 days would result in the
8 collection of data at two opposite lunar phases throughout the year. To better
E: randomize the lunar illumination conditions of collections for each part of the world
2 during a year, a repeat cycle of ~20 days could be utilized. With a polar orbit and a
R, 20-day repeat cycle, most areas of the world could be collected 18 times per year.
«3
3 5.5.5 Alternative orbits. A polar orbit would be required to achieve global
2 coverage from a single satellite and a consistent overpass time in the early evening. A
<5 Nightsat instrument on a platform, such as the 188, could acquire substantial
g quantities of valuable night-time lights data. The relatively low orbit of the 18$
3 would make achieving the GSD and radiometric capabilities specified easier. The
é latitude range over which data could be collected would be limited to approximately
1' 500 north and south. Users would need to consider how variations in the local
é overpass times might affect the observations. More detailed analysis of the diurnal
0‘3 pattern of night-time lighting and power outages associated with disasters could be
2 observed from geostationary satellites. Because geostationary orbits are much
3 higher than standard polar orbits, the spatial resolutions would be coarse. However,
f: as seen with the OLS, spatial resolutions in the range of 1 to 5 km would still provide
g useful data on diurnal patterns and power outages.

D 6. Nightsat observational requirements

We propose a mission sensor with similarity to Landsat, optimized for the

construction of annual global Cloud-free, radiance-Calibrated composite images of

night-time lights. The system capabilities are summarized in table 4.

(1) Low-light imaging with one or more Visible/NIR bands with detection limits
and dynamic range suitable for detecting and measuring radianees from
night-time lights. The minimal detectable radiance should be at least
2.5E—8Watts em_zsr_1um_1.

approximately 100 km.

E 7. Conclusion
2 Satellite sensors, designed for the collection of reﬂected sunlight, do not have
3 detection limits low enough to observe nocturnal lighting. Satellite observation of
g night-time lights at a spatial resolution, suitable for mapping urban forms and
g detection, limits tailored to span the range from sparse development in rural areas to
0% the cores of urban centres will require a specialized sensor. We have analysed a
5‘ combination of ﬁeld, laboratory, and airborne data to develop the general
g specifications for such a system, which we call Nightsat. The data from a
8 Nightsat system would enable a wide range of social, economic, and biological
E applications where there is currently a dearth of systematically collected, unbiased,
8 global data. Nightsat data would provide important constraints and inputs for the
spatial modelling of human population growth and distribution, land use, rates of
development, anthropogenic emissions to the atmosphere and independent
estimation of economic indiees. In addition, Nightsat data would be used to model
and understand human impacts on the environment such as the proliferation of
impervious surface area, non-point sources of aquatic pollution, habitat fragmenta-
tion, and the direct effects of nocturnal lighting on night environment, human
health, security, and the Visibility of stars.

Moderate resolution low-light imaging sensor data would be an important
complement to the mapping capacity of moderate resolution daytime imaging
sensors such as Aster and Landsat because it would provide an unambiguous
indication of the presence of development and growth in development. Nightsat
data would also be useful for calibrating and validating coarser resolution low-light
imaging data acquired with the OLS and VIIRS sensors.

To be effective in delineating primary night-time lighting patterns, Nightsat low-
light imaging data must be acquired in the range of 50 to 100 m spatial resolution and
achieve minimal detectable radiances in the range of 2.5E_8 Watts cm_2 sr_ 1um_1 (or
better) with a SNR of 10. While panchromatic low-light imaging data would be useful,
multispeetral low-lighting imaging data acquired with three to five spectral bands
would enable more quantitative applications and enable the detection of lighting type
conversions. Cloud and ﬁre screening of the low light imaging data would be
accomplished using simultaneously acquired thermal band data. The thermal band
data could come from VIIRS if Nightsat were ﬂown on an NPOESS satellite. The
system would use a combination of methods to produce radiance-Calibrated data.
Geoloeation accuracy would be ~50 m, comparable to that of Landsat. The system
objective would be to collect a sufficient quantity of imagery to construct annual
global Cloud-free composites of night-time lights. A near-sun-synehronous polar
orbit, with an early evening overpass, would provide temporal consistency important
