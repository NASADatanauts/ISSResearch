ABSTRACT
This paper provides a summary of the experimental, analytical, and numerical results of the Capillary Flow Experi-
ment (CFE) performed aboard International Space Station (188) from Increment 9 (beginning August, 2004) through
Increment 16 (ending December, 2007), With 19 Operations by 7 astronauts including: M. Fineke, W. McArthur, J .
Williams, S. Williams, M. Lopez-Alegria, C. Anderson, and P. Whitson. CFE consists of 6 approximately 1 t0 2kg
experiment units designed to probe certain capillary phenomena of fundamental and applied importance, such as
capillary ﬂow in complex containers, critical wetting in discontinuous structures, and large length scale contact line
dynamics. Highly quantitative Video images from the simply performed ﬂight experiments provide immediate eon-
ﬁrmation 0f the usefulness of current analytical design tools, as well as provide guidance to the development of new
ones. A brief review of the experiments and procedures is provided before reporting a selection of experimental re-
sults and comparisons With both analytic and numerical predictions. The products of the work include design tools
for modeling capillary interface dynamics relevant to spacecraft engineering systems.
