Abstract: Investigations of the effects of solar radiation combined with the spaceﬂight factors on biological
objects were performed in the «EXPOSE-R» experiment on the outer surface of 188. After more than 1 year of
outer space exposure, the spores of microorganisms and fungi, as well as two species of plant seeds were analysed
for Viability and the set of biological properties. The experiment provided evidence that not only bacterial and
fungal spores but also dormant forms of plants had the capability to survive a long-term exposure to outer space.
