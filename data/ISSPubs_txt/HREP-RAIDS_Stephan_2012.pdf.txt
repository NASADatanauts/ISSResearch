[1] We present the ﬁrst published measurement of an altitude proﬁle of the O 11 61.7 nm
emission, a dayglow feature that can be used to monitor photoionization of O in the
lower thermosphere. This photoionization process also results in the O 11 83.4 nm emission
that, unlike 61.7 nm, is resonantly scattered by ionospheric 0+. Although ionospheric
characteristics can be inferred from the shape and intensity of 83.4 nm altitude proﬁles, the
interpretation can result in nonunique ion density proﬁles if the intensity of this source of
photons that illuminates the ionosphere from below is unknown. The 61.7 nm emission
provides a means to test the accuracy of current models used to calculate the intensity of
that source. The data presented here were collected by the Remote Atmospheric and
Ionospherio Detection System from the International Space Station on 29 October 2009.
The measured 61.7 nm proﬁles show a steeper drop in intensity below 260 km, Where the
emission peaks, compared to our model calculations. While the current analysis cannot
resolve if the discrepancy is caused by inaccuracies in our model thermospherio
composition, photoabsorption cross sections, or both, a 15%—20% increase in the effective
02 photoabsorption at 61.7 nm produces the best qualitative match to the measured proﬁle.
Ostensibly, 61.7 nm measurements could replace these model calculations as a more direct
measure of the intensity of the 83.4 nm photon source region. In either case, accurate
speciﬁcation of local thermospherio neutral species remains an important component of
daytime ionospheric remote sensing.
