The effect of spaceﬂlght 0n the grav1ty-sensmg auxm gradlent
of roots: GFP reporter gene mlcroscopy 0n orblt
RobertJ Ferlt'2 and Anna—Lisa Paul1

Our primary aim was to determine whether gravity has a direct role in establishing the auxin-mediated gravity-sensing system in
primary roots. Major plant architectures have long been thought to be guided by gravity, including the directional growth of the
primary root via auxin gradients that are then disturbed when roots deviate from the vertical as a gravity sensor. However,
experiments on the International Space Station (ISS) now allow physical clarity with regard to any assumptions regarding the role of
gravity in establishing fundamental root auxin distributions. We examined the spaceﬂight green ﬂuorescent protein (GFP)-reporter
gene expression in roots of transgenic lines of Arabidopsis thaliana: pDRSr::GFP, pTAA1::TAA1—GFP, pSCR::SCR—GFP to monitor auxin
and pARR5::GFP to monitor cytokinin. Plants on the ISS were imaged live with the Light Microscopy Module (LMM), and compared
with control plants imaged on the ground. Preserved spaceﬂight and ground control plants were examined post ﬂight with
confocal microscopy. Plants on orbit, growing in the absence of any physical reference to the terrestrial gravity vector, displayed
typically ”vertical” distribution of auxin in the primary root. This conﬁrms that the establishment of the auxin—gradient system, the
primary guide for gravity signaling in the root, is gravity independent. The cytokinin distribution in the root tip differs between
spaceﬂight and the ground controls, suggesting spaceﬂight-induced features of root growth may be cytokinin related. The
distribution of auxin in the gravity-sensing portion of the root is not dependent on gravity. Spaceﬂight appears benign to auxin and
its role in the development of the primary root tip, whereas spaceﬂight may inﬂuence cytokinin—associated processes.
