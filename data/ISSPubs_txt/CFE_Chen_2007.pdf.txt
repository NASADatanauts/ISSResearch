Interior corners are common constructs employed in ﬂuid systems aboard spacecraft to
passively control large length scale capillary-dominated liquid inventories, i.e. fuel/cryogen
storage tanks. Due to either design or fabrication, an ideally sharp corner may not be
achieved, but rather a somewhat rounded one. In this work, low-gravity drop tower tests
are performed to benchmark recent analytical results predicting capillary driven ﬂows along
interior corners possessing any degree of roundedness. The analysis provides closed-form
solutions that predict meniscus tip location and ﬂow rate as a function of system geometry
and ﬂuid properties and is easily veriﬁed by low-g test. In this paper, a summary of the
analytical solutions is followed by drop tower experimental results for the problem of sudden
imbibition in containers possessing interior corners of varying roundedness. Digitized data
such as meniscus tip location and transient free surface proﬁle are presented. It is shown
that the predictions compare well with experiment, the former of which may be employed
for the immediate and time—efﬁcient design and analysis of current and advanced low-g
ﬂuids management systems.
I. Introduction
INTERIOR corners are common constructs employed in ﬂuid system aboard spacecrafts to passively control
large length scale capillary—dominated liquid inventories, i.e. fuel/cryogen storage tanks. Due to either
design or fabrication, an ideally sharp corner may not be achieved, but rather a somewhat rounded one, as
shown in Fig. 1. Signiﬁcant roundedness can prevent certain imbibition Within porous materials.1 In other
instances slight roundedness can prevent the spread of liquid drops in otherwise wettable corners. Thus, it
may be critical to system design and analysis to quantitatively assess the impact of the degree of roundedness
present on the process.

In general, provided the wetting properties of the system satisfy the Concus—Finn condition2 capillary
ﬂows along interior corners tend to be slender as depicted in ﬁgure 1. This is certainly the case for ﬂows
along high aspect ratio conduits such as polygonal section capillaries3 in micro—gravity. The slenderness of
the liquid column allows application of lubrication theory Where the problem simpliﬁes to one of ﬁrst solving
for the average z—component velocity (w) at any cross—section in the 30—3; plane, called ‘Crossﬂow problem’,
and then using this result and a mass balance to derive an evolution equation for ﬂow along the z—axis. A
solution of the interface shape as a function of boundary conditions and time is generally obtained from
Which the most important features of the ﬂow can be determined. Solutions of this type form the basis from
Which problems of signiﬁcantly greater complexity may be addressed.

For the analysis to succeed the average velocity (w) must be determined as a function of axial corner
position 2:. To accomplish this, one must solve for the ﬂow—resistance function ﬁrst. Ransohoff and Radke4
have investigated rounded corners Where the rounded portion of the corner is concentric With the free surface.
Their ﬂow resistance function ﬂ is determined numerically for a selection of corner half—angles, contact angles,
and degrees of roundedness—the latter of Which is measured using a ratio that employs the depth of the
ﬂuid h. The corner roundedness by this deﬁnition is actually a local quantity, different than What is deﬁned
in this work, and varies along the ﬂow direction if the depth of the ﬂuid Changes. Analyses employing ﬂ for
rounded corner ﬂows must convert the tabulated results to forms that can be used for the global problem.

Figure 1. A ﬂuid column in a rounded corner of open angle 204. The coordinate system is aligned such that the z-axis
is long the vertex of the corner. The three—dimensional surface proﬁle is S(y, z, t). The contact angle is 9.
This approach was adopted by Zhou et al.5 to study hydrocarbon drainage over a layer of water forming
a Virtual rounded corner With the solid walls that form sharp interior corners. It is observed that the ﬂow
along rounded corners is complicated by the fact that the ﬂow resistance varies dramatically in the ﬂow
direction as identiﬁed by Dong and Chatzis6 Who have used the approach of Ransohoff and Radke4 and
performed both analysis and experiments studying imbibition ﬂow in micro—scale capillary tubes of square
cross sections With or Without rounded corners. Their experiments compare relatively well With analysis.
However, the analytic results are strongly dependent on the numerical data of ﬂow resistance.

It is demonstrated by Chen et al.7 that a well—Considered scaling of the cross—ﬂow problem can lead to a
local ﬂow resistance function that is narrowly conﬁned for all of the geometric parameters of the problem.
This feature signiﬁcantly weakens the dependence on numerical data and more importantly greatly expands
the prospects of analysis. Scaling analysis and asymptotic method are used. A local scaling combined With
the global one used previously by Weislogel and Lichter8 (W&L) are used to obtain an analytical form for
the geometric ﬂow resistance function. Asymptotic as well as numerical solutions show that the local ﬂow
resistance function can be treated as a constant so as to reduce substantially the dependence on numerical
results. Employing only local scaling, it can be shown that 3.2 SJ 9 g 00 for all values of 04, 9, RC, and
h. The analytical form of the ﬂow resistance gives rise to an evolution equation for the interface that is
readily solved. Furthermore, a similarity solution of the evolution equation is obtained for capillary rise in
cylindrical containers With rounded corners.

In this paper, a brief summary of analysis and typical results is provided ﬁrst followed by drop tower
experiments of capillary ﬂows in rounded corners. The study is focused on the well developed Viscous ﬂow
regime for Which the analytic Closed—form solutions are in hand. The results Will be presented and discussed
including advancing meniscus tip location, interface proﬁle, and receding bulk meniscus.

II. Analytical results

For the system sketched in ﬁgure 1 there are several characteristic geometric quantities of the problem
such as lengths H , HC, L, and angles oz and 9. Note that H is the characteristic height of the meniscus in
the 30—3; plane measured from the Virtual vertex of the corner if it were sharp. H C is the height of the central
point of the curved corner wall. It is assumed that the rounded corner meets the planar walls tangentially.
In this analysis a perfectly wetting ﬂuid is also assumed, 9 = 0.

The parameter R is a measure of inertia and serves as a strongly geometry dependent capillary ﬂow

tion for the rounded corner problem can Change dramatically depending on H , H C, oz, and 6’. Figure 2 shows
the cross sections of the ﬂow at two extremes. For the sharp—corner—like—section, the corner roundedness is
insigniﬁcant While the opposite is true for the crescent—like—section. This dramatic Change makes it necessary
to combine the global scaling analysis With a local one.
It has been shown that With local and global scaling analysis detailed in Chen et a1.,7 one obtains an

Dramatic simpliﬁcation of the governing similarity equation results in the three asymptotic regimes
(Eq. 17— 19), Which reduce (21) to
1. Sharp corner:

III. Thin ﬁlm ﬂow:

Numerical solutions of these three equation are shown in ﬁgure 3. Note that for the thin ﬁlm ﬂow the
slope of the free surface becomes increasingly steep as the advancing tip is approached. Thus, F,7 —> —00 as
77 —> 77mg. For gradients too steep at the tip, the assumptions of a locally slender column 62 << 1 and dominant

Note that H appears in both equations 31 and 32. This is the constant height H for the ﬂow according to
W&L. The method of de Lazzer et a1.13 may be used to determine H for right polygonal cylinders. A general
approach is given by Finn and Neel.14 It is important to note that for a given polygonal cross—section, H
does not depend on the degree of corner roundedness A.

III. Capillary Rise Experiment
III.A. Experimental Setup
Capillary rise experiments reported here are conducted at NASA’s Glenn Research Center 2.2s drop tower
facility. The drop tower provides IOW—g environment of 10—490. Detailed information of this facility may be
found in Lekan et al.15

The test cells are made of acrylic With uniform cross section. The cross section of the cells is one of
an equilateral triangle but With one corner rounded as shown in ﬁgure 4. The side of the triangle Without
roundedness is 12mm long. A total of eight cells are used each With different roundedness as listed in
Table 2. The length D in ﬁgure 4 is listed as well. Physical properties of the liquids for the tests are adopted
from Weislogel and Ross9 and listed in Table 3. Note that the refractive index of acrylic is 1.491. The
difference between the refractive index of the test cell material and test ﬂuids introduces some uncertainty
in experiments as Will be discussed.

Test cell preparation includes washing With a soap solution in hot water, rinsing thoroughly With distilled
water, then rinsing With ethanol and/or methanol followed by a ﬁnal distilled water rinse. The cells are
allowed to air dry or are dried in a vacuum oven. A test cell is installed in a drop rig apparatus. Prior
to release of the apparatus into free fall, a certain amount of test ﬂuid is injected into the cell so as to ﬁll
it partly. Upon release, hydrostatics forces are essentially eliminated and capillary driven ﬂow ensues. As
ﬂuid is drawn downstream along the corners, the ﬂuid near the container centerline bows forming the ‘bulk
meniscus’ Which recedes upstream. The ﬂow process is backlighted by a diffuse light source and ﬁlmed at
Table 2. Corner roundedness and dimension D of the test cells. The average uncertainty of A measurement is Within
i3%.

then analyzed using an image software tool, Spotlight.16
III.B. Results and Discussions
Primary measurements from the experiments are advancing meniscus tip location L(t), the receding meniscus
height or interface minimum Z(t), and the interface proﬁle or meniscus centerline height h(z, t).
III.B.]. Tip Location, L(t)
Prior to the release, the ﬂuid Wicks into the corners in the test cell slightly, as shown in the leftmost image
in ﬁgure 6. After the release, ﬂuid is redistributed along the corners and after a certain time a location
along the interface is established Where the transverse height remains a constant, H . This height is called
the constant height. To reduce the data, an essential step is to identify the constant height location for each
test. W&L demonstrated in much detail the process of the identiﬁcation. Once the constant height location
is found, it serves as the origin for z coordinate axis. The release mechanism provides a nearly discontinuous
reduction of gravity 9. Consequently, inertia plays a dominant role at the early stage of the bulk meniscus
reorientation. Such inertial transients take place Within a Characteristic time tLC, see W&L. Throughout
this study, the efforts are focused on the ﬂow regime Where Viscous and capillary forces balance and the
analytical results can be applied.

The effect of corner roundedness and ﬂuid Viscosity 0n the tip location can be seen in Figures 7 and 8.
As anticipated, the tip velocity decreases With increasing corner roundedness A and increasing ﬂuid Viscosity.
The solid lines are ﬁts L = c + mt1/2 t0 the data for t Z 0.16s.

Multiple drop tests are conducted to determine the repeatability of the measurements in regards to
cleaning technique, ﬁll technique, and so on. Typical data are shown in ﬁgure 9, Which shows that the
repeatability is Within i6% When comparing ﬁtting parameter coefﬁcients. In addition, the initial surface
condition does not show signiﬁcant effects on the tip location data17 as one data set is obtained With dry
surface While the rest are With pre—wet surfaces.

"11","It is instructive to compare the slope of the meniscus tip location in Viscous domain for the experimental
and analytical results. This is performed in Figure 10. Equation 31 gives the analytical value of m. An
error bar representing i13% about the mean experimental value is plotted. This percentage error is the
mean value of the difference between the experimental and analytical values. The comparisons show that for
smaller roundedness A, the analysis under—predicts the slope While for large A the opposite is true. The largest
percentage error is found in intermediate A for 2 CS ﬂuid. It is interesting to see that such discrepancies
present in test cells that have similar corner roundedness. The explanation for this Will require further study.

[11.32. Surface Proﬁle
The analysis provides similarity solutions for the capillary rise ﬂow in the Viscous domain. The similarity
equation is given in Eq. 21. The solutions of the equation describe the proﬁles of the interface in its symmetry
plane and provide important information such as the meniscus tip location and the slope of the interface at
the constant height location Which can be used to determine the ﬂow rate. It is shown above that in general
the slopes of the linear ﬁt of the tip location in the Viscous domain agree well With the prediction given by
Eq. 31. It is interesting to compare the interface proﬁle to the similarity solution.

Figure 11(a) shows the interface proﬁles at different moments for A20.368. The ﬁrst trace is at t=0.2s,
Where it is found that the constant height H is ﬁrst established. Hexp is found to be 1.95mm compared to
the computed value of ch : 2.05mm. During a drop test the ﬂuid inside the test cell goes through at least
two ﬂow regimes before it reaches the Viscous ﬂow domain. This causes the linear ﬁt of the tip location to
have a form L = mt1/2 + c Where the constant c is the intersection of the linear ﬁt With y—axis. However,
the similarity transformation is in the form of 77 = 27/ (011775)”2 as given in Eq. 20. As a result, one can not
simply nondimensionalize the experimental data of 27 using the similarity transformation form because the
time origin for the Viscous ﬂow domain is not at t : 0s. One way to do this is to pick

27
\/GH(t1/2 +c/m) ( )
Unfortunately, in order to use the given similarity transformation form, one has to apply a certain time shift
such that z = m(t + At)1/2, Which can be shown 0 produce a time shift as a function of time.

The dimensionless data sets are shown in ﬁgure 11(b). The numerical solution of Eq. 21 for this case is
shown as the solid line. The convergence of the proﬁles With increasing time is evident. However, there is
disagreement between the converged proﬁle and the similarity solution.

Surface proﬁles for A = 0.26 and 0.48 are shown in ﬁgure 12 and 13 respectively. The analysis under—
prediots the tip location for the case Where A = 0.26 and over—predicts it for the case Where A = 0.48. In
the latter case, the tip location is substantially lower than the analytical prediction. Note that an inﬂection
point is observed in the proﬁles in ﬁgure 12. It is speculated that this is caused by the unmatched refraction
indices of the test ﬂuid and the test cell material.

[11.33. Receding Bulk: Meniscus

The axial location of the interface minimum Z is the lowest point of the receding bulk meniscus and is
measured from the initial minimum location. The start of the capillary driven ﬂow along the corners is also
the start of the reorientation of the bulk meniscus. Likewise, the reorientation also goes through inertial
ﬂow regimes.

Interface minimum data are shown in ﬁgure 14. The impact of the corner roundedness A on the Char—
acteristic time of inertial regime 75,36 is essentially indistinguishable for the data presented. Note that there
are always capillary ﬂows in the other two sharp corners during the drop tests. As the ﬂow in the sharp
corners is faster than that in the rounded one, the contribution from the rounded corner is relatively weak
as A increases. The data also show that the effect of the ﬂuid Viscosity is not signiﬁcant.

IV. Conclusions

Capillary driven ﬂow along rounded corners in cylindrical containers are studied. The study is aimed
at conﬁrming the analytical results obtained from previous theoretical studies for Viscous ﬂow regime Where
capillary and Viscous forces balance.

As anticipated, the corner roundedness reduces the tip velocity. The slopes of the advancing tip rise data
compare favorably With the analysis in general With agreement to Within i13%. The analysis under—predicts

proﬁles are compared With the similarity solutions as well. Even though the similarity solution represents
the long time behavior, the experimental data show the trend of convergence of the surface proﬁle despite
the limited test time. The interface minimum data shows that the impact of the corner roundedness 0n
the inertial regime time scale is insigniﬁcant. Further study Will include a detailed analysis of discrepancy
between the experiment and the analysis.
