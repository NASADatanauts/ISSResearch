Abstract: Coastal marine biological and sediment-transport processes are examined with HICO
(Hyperspectral Imager for the Coastal Ocean) data and other remote sensing and in situ
observations. The value of HICO spatial and spectral resolution is illustrated.
Summary
The Hyperspectral Imager for the Coastal Ocean (HICO) was built to demonstrate the utility of higher spatial
resolution and hyperspectral imaging for ocean waters. HICO is ﬂying on the International Space Station (188), has
been operating since September 2009, and has collected over 5000 images of coastal ocean sites [1,2]. HICO data
covers the 400-900 nm spectral range at 5.7 nm spectral sampling with a 93 m Ground Sample Distance (GSD).
Earlier studies with airborne hyperspectral imagers demonstrated the utility of hyperspectral data for coastal ocean
studies, particularly when the bottom is imaged or intense blooms of microscopic algae are present [3,4]. Using 10
m airborne hyperspectral data from Monterey Bay, [5] showed that 100 m GSD sampling was required to image
oceanic fronts, blooms and other features. Utilization of spectral resolution to understand complex coastal
environments has been well developed [6,7]. In this contribution, we examine HICO images of Monterey Bay,
California, together with data from other remote sensing platforms (satellite, coastal HF radar) and autonomous
underwater vehicles (AUVs) in a multi-scale, multidisciplinary study of complex coastal ocean phenomena.

color image and parameters derived from MODIS Aqua data acquired on 27 April 2011, 14:30 PDT. nFLH is normalized chlorophyll
ﬂuorescence line height, indicative of the abundance of microscopic algae; PIC is particulate inorganic carbon, indicative of resuspended
sediments. The white contour in (a) and the black contours in (c,d) deﬁne the plume of resuspended sediments.

Multi-platform sate11ite remote sensing describes the conditions present within a period of repeated HICO
acquisitions of the Monterey Bay region of central California. The characteristic signal of coastal upwelling in this
region is eVident in the sea surface temperature (SST) image (Fig. 1a) as a cold ﬁlament originating from the coastal
boundary north of the bay, and extending southward across the bay mouth. This wind-driven coastal upwelling
draws deep nutrient-enriched waters into the shallow sunlit layer, thereby supporting the growth of microscopic
algae, phytoplankton. In patterns of blue, green or reddish coloration, RGB images qualitatively describe
distributions of phytoplankton (Fig. 1b), and ﬂuorescence of phytoplankton chlorophyll can be quantiﬁed (Fig. lc).
While nutrient supply is essential to support ocean life through algal primary production, some algal blooms can

harm marine life and people [8,9]. Three quarters of all harmful algal bloom (HAB) species are dinoﬂagellates [10],
motile microalgae that typically aggregate near the surface during the day, where they are detectable by remote
sensing due to the intensity and spectral character of their reﬂectance [11,12].

In addition to nutrients, coastal upwelling can bring to the surface turbid ﬂuid from the bottom boundary layer
of the continental shelf. This too is a highly Visible to remote sensing. In the Monterey Bay region, this sediment
signal may be eVident as milky coloration within cold upwelled waters (Figs. la,b), and it is quantiﬁable (Fig. 1d).
Comparison of the patterns in SST, chlorophyll ﬂuorescence, and suspended sediments in Fig. 1 indicates a
sediment plume extending southward within waters of low phytoplankton abundance, along the inshore edge of the
upwelling ﬁlament. Sediment transport can inﬂuence the ecology of benthic zooplankton having pelagic larval
stages [13], its constituents may inﬂuence the toxicity of certain microalgae [l4], and it has been hypothesized as an
important link in mercury cycling in coastal waters [15]. Thus, the focus of this paper is upon ecologically
signiﬁcant pelagic features that can be effectively characterized by high—resolution hyperspectral remote sensing,
augmented by additional remote sensing and in situ data.

F igure 2. Vertical sections of properties measured by the Dorado AUV along the track shown in Fig. 1, between 14:00 and 23:00 on 28 April
2011. The depth range shown is 2 to 40 m. Arrows indicate near-surface features examined with remote sensing data: (A) a phytoplankton
bloom patch, and (B) sediments transported from an upwelling center (Fig. 1). The property bb 420 is optical backscattering at 420 nm.
The features detected by remote sensing were observed in situ by multiple AUVs. Multidisciplinary observations
from one of the AUVs are shown in Fig. 2 (surface track shown in Fig. l). The bloom patch in central Monterey
Bay observed by MODIS (Fig. 1c) was transected by the AUV (label A in Chlor section of Fig. 2). The low—
chlorophyll, sediment—enriched waters observed by satellite (Fig. lc,d) were eVident in situ (Fig. 2). They exhibited
elevated salinity, density, nitrate (nutrient) concentrations, and optical backscattering (label B in the bb420 section),
and depressed temperature and oxygen concentration. The color of particles in the sediment plume sampled at the
western edge of the AUV survey was distinct from the color of phytoplankton (backscattering ratio in the last panel
of Fig. 2 relative to Chlor). These coastal features were observed by additional sensors on the Dorado AUV,
including a sensor that measured the particle size distribution and a particle imaging device, and they were
repeatedly observed and autonomously tracked for two days by the T ethys AUV. Autonomous localization of the
moving front by T ethys, using onboard algorithms, provided targeting information required by Dorado and its water
Gulper sampling system. The time—series from both AUVs illustrate temporal variability across the central bay.
HICO images of Monterey Bay were acquired on 25 April, 27 April, and 3 May 2011. During this period, Monterey
Bay experienced signiﬁcant changes in wind—driven upwelling and upper—ocean water properties. Of particular
interest was intensiﬁcation of upwelling that resulted in a diminishing signal of phytoplankton chlorophyll
ﬂuorescence (Figure 3) and variation in the signal of suspended sediments. Using time—series of moored

environmental observations, HF radar measurements of surface currents, and AUV characterization of the water
column, we describe the inﬂuences of advection and mixing on the environment of the bay, and on the signals
detected by the HICO time-series.
