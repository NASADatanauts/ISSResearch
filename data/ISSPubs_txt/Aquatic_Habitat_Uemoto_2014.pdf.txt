Rece‘veccll 1“ re‘gISEd form 27 November 2013 harmful ammonia excreted from aquatic animals in a closed water circulation system (Aquatic Habitat).
ACCEpte 1 Fe wary 2014 The biological ﬁlter is a cylindrical tank packed with porous glass beads for nitriﬁcation and dual plastic
K-— bags for denitriﬁcation. The porous beads are supporting media for Nitrosomonas europaea and Nitrobacter

Denitriﬁcation ammonia to nitrate via nitrite. On the other hand, the dual bag is composed of an outer non—woven fabric
Biological ﬁlter bag and an inner non—porous polyethylene ﬁlm bag. The outer bag is supporting media for Paracoccus
Closed water recirculation system pantotrophus. The inner bag, in which 99.5% ethanol is packed, releases the ethanol slowly, since ethanol
Aquarium can permeate through the non—porous polyethylene ﬁlm. The P. pantotrophus cells on the outer bag reduce
the produced nitrate to nitrogen gas by using the released ethanol as an electron donor for denitriﬁcation.
The biological ﬁlter constructed in this study consequently removed the ammonia without accumulating
nitrate. Most of the excess ethanol was consumed and did not affect the nitriﬁcation activity of the
N. europaea cells and N. winogradskyi cells severely. In accordance with the aquatic animal experiments
in the 155, small freshwater ﬁsh had been bred in the closed water circulation system equipped with the
biological ﬁlter for 90 days. Ammonia concentration daily excreted from ﬁsh is assumed to be 1.7 mg—N/ L
in the recirculation water. Under such conditions, the harmful ammonia and nitrite concentrations were
kept below 0.1 mg—N/L in the recirculation water. Nitrate and total organic carbon concentrations in the
recirculation water were kept below 5 mg—N/L and 3 mg—C/L, respectively. All breeding ﬁsh were alive
and ate the feed well. The results show that the nitriﬁcation and denitriﬁcation abilities of the biological
ﬁlter suﬁiced to keep water quality for aquatic animal experiments in the 155. This simple and effective
system is certainly applicable to aquarium systems and aquaculture systems.
