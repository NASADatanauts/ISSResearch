24 Tian Jian, Michael J . Pecaut, J ames M. Slater, and Daila S. Gridley. NASA has reported
25 pulmonary abnormalities in astronauts on space missions, but the molecular changes in lung
26 tissue remain unknown. The goal of the present study was to explore the effects of spaceﬂight 011
27 expression of extracellular matrix (ECM), cell adhesion and pro-fibrotie molecules in lungs of
28 mice ﬂown on Space Shuttle Endeavour (STS-118). C57BL/6Ntac mice housed in animal
29 enclosure modules during a 13-day mission in space (FLT) were euthanized within hours after
30 return; ground controls were treated similarly for comparison (GRD). Analysis of genes
31 associated with ECM and adhesion molecules was performed according to quantitative RT-PCR.
32 The data revealed that FLT lung samples had statistically significant transcriptional changes, i.e.,
33 at least 15-fold, in 25 out of 84 examined genes (P < 0.05); 15 genes were up—regulated and 10
34 were down-regulated. The genes that were up—regulated by more than 2-fold were Ctgf, MmpZ,
35 Ncam] , Spare, Spock], and T imp3 , whereas the most down-regulated genes were Lama] , Mmp3,
36 Mmp 7, vcam-I, and Sele. Histology showed proﬁbrosis-like changes occurred in FLT mice,
37 more abundant collagen accumulation around blood vessels, and thicker walls compared with
38 lung samples form GRD mice. Immunohistochemistry was used to compare expression of siX
39 selected proteins associated with ﬁbrosis. Immunoreaetivity of four proteins (MMP-2, CTGF,
40 TGF-Bl, and NCAM) was enhanced by spaceﬂight, whereas, no difference was detected in
41 expression of MMP-7 and MMP-9 proteins between the FLT and GRD groups. Taken together,
42 the data demonstrate that signiﬁcant changes can be readily detected shortly after return from
43 spaceﬂight in the expression of factors that can adversely inﬂuence lung ﬁanetion.

47 (Introduction)
48 Concern for the health of orewmembers on space missions has prompted several countries to
49 monitor their Vital signs and establish facilities for scientiﬁc experiments. Studies on National
50 Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) Spaoelabs have found that pulmonary function
51 in astronauts is greatly altered by weightlessness, e.g., increased diffusing capacity and reduced
52 residual volume (72). Other factors inherent to the spacecraft environment, such as inhalation of
53 potentially pathogenic microbes and exposure to radiation (46), could further compromise the
54 function of this Vital organ.
55 At least two different lung diseases can occur due to an imbalance in extracellular matrix
56 (ECM) homeostasis. Emphysema associated With the adult lung is thought to result from
57 excessive proteolytio destruction of ECM Without adequate repair Via an imbalance in
58 proteinase-antiproteinase activity (23). In contrast, pulmonary ﬁbrosis is characterized by
59 progressive interstitial deposition of ECM (35), possibly the result of a more inhibitory
60 proteolytio mioroenvironment With decreased matrix removal (17). Studies have also
61 demonstrated that ionizing irradiation can cause acute inﬂamation, followed by pulmonary
62 fibrosis (15, 28, 44). Initiation of late radiation—induoed lung damage has been correlated With
63 up—regulation of certain adhesion molecules, followed by inﬁltration of macrophages and bone
64 marrow-derived ﬁbroblasts forming the fibrotio lesions of organizing alveolitis/ﬁbrosis (16).
65 Increased deposition of abnormal ECM accelerates activation of collagen producing cells.
66 Several proteases and antiproteases also participate in ECM metabolism.
67 The integrity and metabolism of ECM components are critical in lung development and
68 maintenance of normal function and morphology. Collagen is one of the maj or components of
69 ECM, accounting for ~15 % of the dry lung mass, and is under constant remodeling With one-

"
"4","4
70 tenth of the total lung collagen being degraded and newly synthesized each day (41). Stable
71 adhesion during eell-eell and cell-ECM interactions are essential for adequate cell
72 communication, epithelial integrity, and ECM metabolism. Such interactions are mediated
73 through several different families of cell adhesion molecules (CAM) including the integrins,
74 eadherins, selectins, and immunoglobulin superfamily. Therefore, CAMs play an important role
75 in maintaining the normal structure and function of the lung (1). CAMs also trigger intracellular
76 pathways and participate in cellular processes such as migration, proliferation, differentiation,
77 and cell death. In addition, they have been recognized to play a maj or role in a variety of
78 pathological phenomena.
79 Transforming growth factor (TGF)-B is the most important cytokine involved in ECM
80 remodeling, leading to development of ﬁbrosis in all parenchymal organs (71). TGF-B causes
81 myofibroblast differentiation, induces expression of connective tissue growth factor (CTGF), and
82 increases the synthesis of ECM components such as collagen and fibronectin (33). In addition,
83 TGF-Bl has both positive and negative effects on synthesis of specific matrix metalloproteinases
84 (MMP) (6).
85 MMPs are a major group of proteases, including gelatinases MMP-2 and MMP-9, and
86 matrilysin MMP-7, known to play a pivotal role in ECM metabolism and homeostasis of
87 basement membrane (45). In addition to digesting ECM and basement membrane proteins, these
88 proteases cleave other MMPs, growth factors, growth factor binding proteins, ehemokines,
89 eytokines, cell surface receptors, and adhesion molecules, as well as an array of other proteases
90 and protease inhibitors (49, 78). MMP-2 and MMP-9 have signiﬁcant activity in the
91 pathogenesis of emphysema (23), and both can be present in fibrotie tissues (11). MMP-2 may
92 be associated With impaired tissue remodeling leading to pathological collagen deposition and

"

93 pulmonary fibrosis (77), Whereas MMP-9 has been linked to inﬂammation-induced tissue

94 remodeling (66, 77). Several studies have shown that MMP-2 and MMP-9 are induced by

95 ionizing radiation (7, 50, 53). Similar to MMP-2, MMP-7 displays broad proteolytic activity

96 against a variety of ECM substrates, including collagen, proteoglycans, elastin, laminin,

97 fibronectin, and casein (43, 73, 75). The study of MMP-7 knockout mice suggests that the

98 enzyme may be involved in aberrant reparative processes in fibrotie lung diseases (79).

99 MMPs are inhibited by tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinases (TIMPs), enzymes that are up-
100 regulated by TGF-Bl (59). Cell death due to severe injury is a triggering event of fibrosis by
101 causing the neighboring cells to release TGF-Bl, CTGF, and tumor necrosis faetor-oc (TNF-Ot)
102 (5, 22). CTGF, an important fibrogenie factor, is a downstream mediator of TGF-Bl responses
103 (52). TWO mechanisms underlie the synergistic effect of CTGF 0n TGF-Bl. First, CTGF acts as a
104 chaperone that augments TGF-Bl signaling. Upon binding to TGF-Bl, CTGF increases the
105 afﬁnity of TGF-Bl to its receptor, causing a sustained response (36). Second, CTGF blocks a
106 TGF-Bl auto-inhibitory feedback loop, in that it suppresses de novo synthesis of smad-7 Via
107 activation of TIEG-l transcription (56). In addition, CTGF regulates cellular apoptosis and
108 fibroblast proliferation, angiogenesis, cellular adhesion, chemotaxis, and ECM deposition (52).
109 Our previous studies using a mouse model have demonstrated that exposure to proton
110 radiation mimicking a solar explosion (simulated SPE protons) can induce TGF-Bl, MMP-2, and
111 collagen expression in lung tissue (68). Studies have documented numerous immune aberrations
112 in astronauts, cosmonauts, and research animals following space ﬂight (9, 18, 20, 30, 31, 38, 42,
113 47, 61, 62). The spaceﬂight environment can undoubtedly have a significant impact on a variety
114 of immune mechanisms, some of which may inﬂuence pulmonary function. To date, however,
115 there are 110 published reports 011 inﬂammatory processes and expression of ECM, adhesion, and

116 proﬁbrotie molecules in the lungs in response to spaceﬂight. In the present study, we evaluated
117 these parameters in mice shortly after a 13-day ﬂight 011 Space Shuttle Endeavour, i.e., Space
118 Transport System (STS)-118.
1 19
120 MATERIALS AND METHODS
121 Animals and sample collection. Female C57BL/6Ntac mice (~ 7 wk of age, 11:24, Taeonic
122 Farms, Germantown, NY) were shipped directly to the National Aeronautics and Space
123 Administration (NASA) Space Life Sciences Laboratory at Kennedy Space Center (KSC). Both
124 ﬂight and ground-eontrol mice (FLT and GRD, respectively) were housed in animal enclosure
125 modules (AEM) and were acclimated to the food bar diet and water for 1wk before investigation.
126 The FLT mice ﬂew onboard the Space Shuttle Endeavour (STS-118) for 13 days. GRD mice
127 were exposed to environmental settings (temperature, relative humidity, and atmosphere C02
128 levels) similar to the spaee-ﬂight animals, with telemetry from the shuttle 011 a 48 h time delay.
129 Muscle strength testing and nuclear magnetic resonance body composition measurements were
130 performed at KSC before euthanasia with 100% C02 within 3-5 h after landing. Right lungs of
131 mice were quick frozen at -700C for gene expression, and left lungs were ﬁxed in 10% buffered
132 formalin for histology and analysis of immunoreactivity for proﬁbrotic proteins.
133
134 Analysis ofgene expression by quantitative reverse transcrlptase-polymemse chain reaction
135 (RT-PCR). The frozen lungs from both FLT and GRD mice were shipped overnight to Lorna
136 Linda University. Frozen lung tissue was homogenized in Trizol and total RNA was extracted
137 according to a standard protocol (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA). RNA integrity was assessed
138 spectrophotometrically. For best results for the PCR array, all RNA samples were assessed for

"
"7","7
139 purity by UV spectrophotometry; the A260/A230 ratio was over 1.7, and A260/A280 ratio was
140 greater than 2.0. The 84 genes assessed by RT-PCR using the Mouse Extracellular Matrix and
141 Adhesion Molecules array (RT2 ProﬁlerTM PCR Array PAMM-013; SuperArray Biosciences,
142 Frederick, MD) are listed in Table 1. Details of the procedure have been previously reported
143 (19). Gene expression of FLT mice with a fold-ehange larger than 2.0 compared with GRD mice
144 and for which a P < 0.05 was obtained are emphasized. Additional genes for which fold change
145 was 1.1 to 1.5, but which also had P < 0.05, are brieﬂy described.
146
147 Morphology. For histological and immunohistochemical staining, the left lungs from both FLT
148 and GRD groups were fixed in 10% buffered formalin. After 6 h, the samples were rinsed
149 thoroughly in tap water and dehydrated in graded alcohol prior to parafﬁn embedding. Then, thin
150 sections of 5 um thickness were made for staining. After deparaffinization in Histoelear (Fisher
151 Scientiﬁc, Pittsburgh, PA), sections were rehydrated in alcohol series and stained in hematoxylin
152 and eosin (H & E).

154 Collagen staining. Sirius Red staining was utilized to compare collagen deposition in lung tissue
155 between the two groups. Deparaffinized and rehydrated slides were immersed in saturated picrie
156 acid for 20 min, and rinsed in tap water until the yellow stain in specimens was cleared. The
157 slides then were stained with 0.1% Sirius Red solution (0.5 g of Direct Red 80; Sigma-Aldrieh,
158 St. Louis, MO) in 500 m1 of pierie acid) for 1 h, washed in two changes of acidified water (5 m1
159 glacial acetic acid in 1 L of water), and counterstained with hematoxylin.

161 Immunothistochemical staining. Lung sections were treated with 3% H202 and DAKO Retrieval
162 buffer (S2368, Dako, Glostrup, Denmark) prior to immunostaining. Target Retrieval Solution
163 (S2368, pH 9; Dako, Denmark) was applied for unmasking antigenicity by incubating sections at
164 95 CC for 20 min prior to incubation with primary antibodies. For goat anti-mouse primary
165 antibodies binding to MMP-2, MMP-7, MMP-9, CTGF, and CD45, 3% of hydrogen peroxide
166 was used to inhibit endogenous peroxidase activity for 10 min at room temperature. For goat
167 anti-rnouse primary antibodies, endogenous peroxidase in lung tissue was inhibited by incubating
168 sections in 100% methanol containing 3% H202 for 20 min at 37 CC prior to antigen retrieval. In
169 order to avoid errors during immunohistochemical staining, we placed at least four samples 011
170 each microscope slide; the same number of samples from FLT and GRD groups were placed 011
171 each slide. Therefore, samples from the two groups were treated under exactly the same
172 conditions: length of incubation time, temperature, and concentration of antibodies.
173 Immunoreactivity 0f TGF-Bland NCAM. Monoclonal antibody (mAb) against mouse
174 TGF-Bl (R& D Systems, 1110., Minneapolis, MN) and NCAM (American Research Products,
175 Inc.TM, Belmont, MA) were employed to detect expression of these two proteins in lung tissue.
176 The Millipore Chemicon Mouse-to-mouse IHC Detection System Kit was applied for amplifying
177 primary antibody signals (Milipore-Chemieon International, 1110., Temecula, CA). For saturation
178 of non-speeiﬁc binding sites, sections were incubated with Pre-antibody Blocking solution prior
179 to incubation with primary antibody. After nonspeciﬁc binding sites were blocked, the mouse
180 primary mAb was covered on tissue samples overnight in a humidified chamber at 4 CC followed
181 by washings in TBS (PBS containing 0.05% Triton X 100). Sections were then incubated with
182 Post-antibody Blocking solution for 20 min at RT. Immunostaining was performed by
183 incubating sections with Poly-HRP-Anti-M0use/Rabbit IgG for 30 min at RT followed by

184 Visualization using diaminobenzidine (DAB) Chromogen. Hematoxylin was used as
1 85 counterstain.
186 Immunoreaetivity of MMP-2, MMP-7, MMP-9, CTGF, CD45. Goat anti-recombinant mouse
187 MMP primary polyclonal antibodies (R & D Systems) were applied to the specimens overnight
188 at 40C, followed by incubating lung tissue with an anti-goat biotinylated secondary antibody and
189 High Sensitivity Streptavidin conjugated to Horseradish Peroxidase (HSS-HRP). Visualization
190 was performed using DAB Chromogen Reagent. Also, the hematoxylin was applied to
1 9 1 counterstain.
192 Inﬂammatory cells. In order to evaluate inﬂammatory response in lungs of animals after
193 spaceﬂight, the number of CD45 positive cells in FLT samples was obtained by counting 100
194 cells in ﬁve randomly selected ﬁelds in each section and compared with the count in the GRD
195 group.
196
197 Statistical analysis. The difference in expression of specific genes and CD4+ cell counts between
198 FLT and GRD groups was determined using Student’s t—test (Systat, Systat Software, Richmond,
199 CA). A P < 0.05 was considered as signiﬁcant, whereas P < 0.10 indicated a trend.
200
201 RESULTS
202 Histopathology. N0 marked abnormality in bronchiolar epithelium and alveolar epithelium was
203 found in the lung tissue from both groups. Also, no difference in the thickness for pulmonary
204 interalveolar septa was detected between two groups. The maj 0r histological changes originated
205 from mesenchyma (Fig. 1). Profibrosis-like foci consisting of connective tissue components,
206 fibroblasts, and thickening vascular walls occurred in some FLT samples (Fig. 1, top row).

207 Collagen depositions surrounding vascular vessels disclosed by Sirius Red staining were wider
208 and more abundant in samples from FLT than those from GRD mice (Fig. 1, middle row).
209 Immunostaining for common leukocyte marker CD45 was applied to compare inﬂammatory
210 response of lungs after space ﬂight with ground-controls. Immunoreactivity showed that positive
211 cells were predominantly distributed in sites around vesicular vessels, and a few were scattered
212 in alveolar spaces (Fig. 1, bottom row). There was no signiﬁcant difference in the number of
213 positive cells between FLT and GRD groups (P = 0.343). In addition, lung tissue with H & E
214 staining did not show remarkable inﬂammatory infiltration in both groups.
21 5
216 Gene expression in lung tissue. Signiﬁcant differences in gene expression proﬁles in the lung
217 between spaceﬂight and ground-control groups (P < 0.05) are presented in Table 2. Among 84
218 assessed genes, 26 genes were signiﬁcantly altered with fold-change larger than 1.5 (15 up-
219 regulated genes and 11 down-regulated genes). The genes that were up—regulated by greater than
220 2-f01d were ctgf, mmpZ, nacm] , spare, Spock] , and timp3, whereas the most down-regulated
221 genes were lama], mmp3, mmp 7, mmp13, vcam-I and 5616. Statistical significance was obtained
222 for 11 additional genes with fold change ranging from 1.1 to 1.5 in FLT mice (6 up—regulated
223 and 5 down-regulated) versus the GRD controls, as shown in Table 2. Of the 57 genes
224 associated with cell adhesion molecules, 38.6% (22/57) were signiﬁcantly affected by
225 spaceﬂight (12 up—regulated and 10 down-regulated with P < 0.05); whereas among the 49
226 examined genes related to ECM proteins, 53.1% (26/49) were affected after ﬂight (17 up-
227 regulated and 9 down-regulated). (Note: functions of some genes overlap each other.)

229 Expression and distribution ofproﬁbrotic proteins. The mAb for TGF-Bl used in the present
230 study did not discriminate between latent and active forms, thus the staining intensity represented
231 the total amount of TGF-Bl protein. The staining pattern for TGF-Bl protein for the two groups
232 was similar. Immunostaining was present in bronchiolar epithelial cells, type I alveolar
233 pneumooytes, and endothelial cells, as well as in basement membranes and ﬁbroblasts in
234 mesenchyma. However, immunostaining intensity was substantially increased in alveolar
235 pneumooytes, endothelial cells, and bronchiolar epithelium in samples from FLT mice compared
236 to those from GRD controls (Fig. 2).
237 The bronchiolar epithelium showed a prominent immunostaining for CTGF protein in both
238 groups and a few alveolar macrophages occasionally exhibited an immunoreaction (Fig. 2).
239 However, the immunoreactivity of CTGF was slightly enhanced in bronchiolar epithelium after
240 spaceﬂight versus the GRD group. No marked immunostaining in other types of cells was
241 detected in either group.
242 RT-PCR data revealed that up—regulation of NCAM-l transcription was most pronounced
243 among the 84 examined genes after space ﬂight (4.5 5-fold compared to GRD mice). Thus,
244 immunostaining was used to evaluate the post-transoriptional level and distribution of this
245 protein in lung tissue. The product of this protein was detected in type I pneumooytes,
246 endothelial cells, and basement membrane. Fibroblasts in connective tissue were also positive.
247 No immunreaotion was seen in bronchiolar epithelium. Consistent with mRNA level,
248 immunostaining intensity of NCAM was also enhanced after space ﬂight compared to the GRD
249 control group (Fig. 2). An increased staining was also observed in type I pneumooytes and
250 basement membranes in FLT samples.

251 Zymogen forms of the MMPs (pro-MMPs) are secreted into the matrix from a large number
252 of cell types and activation of the pro-MMPs in the local microenvironment can result in discrete
253 alterations in tissue architecture. Therefore, we compared the expression levels and cellular
254 distribution of MMP-2, MMP-7, and MMP-9 in lung tissue from the two groups. MMP-2. The
255 immunoreactivity for MMP-2 was predominantly present in epithelial cells of bronchioles, and a
256 few inﬂammatory cells exhibited positive reaction. In FLT mice, immunostaining intensity for
257 MMP-2 was enhanced in bronchiolar epithelium and positive inﬂammatory cells in alveolar
258 spaces were more abundant as compared to GRD mice (Fig. 3). Similar to the MMP-2 staining
259 pattern, immunoreactivity of MMP-7 and MMP-9 was predominantly present in the bronchiolar
260 epithelial cells and inﬂammatory cells in samples from both FLT and GRD groups. However, in
261 contrast to MMP-2, no signiﬁcant difference in staining intensity was detected either in
262 bronchiolar epithelial or in inﬂammatory cells between the two groups (Fig. 3).
263
264 DISCUSSION
265 In this study, mouse lung tissue was investigated to evaluate a potentially serious health
266 hazard of spaceﬂight, since the lungs are very vulnerable to increased levels of radiation,
267 inhalation of bacteria that may have high antibiotic resistance, and low ambient oxygen. First, we
268 wanted to determine whether the compromised lung function associated with spaceﬂight (72)
269 could be at least partly related to impaired integrity of airways and alveolar epithelium and/or
270 inﬂammation. The second goal was to determine whether molecules associated with ECM
271 remodeling and development of fibrosis were affected by spaceﬂight.
272 Histopathologically, a few proﬁbrotic lesions consisting of abundant connective tissue occurred
273 in air spaces and blood vessel walls were thickened in lungs of FLT mice, but no marked

"
"13","13
274 abnormality was found in bronchiolar and alveolar epithelium. Appearance of more collagen
275 around vessels in FLT mice, based on Sirius Red staining, indicates that spaceﬂight may have
276 enhanced collagen synthesis and/or attenuated degradation of this ECM component. Collagen is
277 the maj 0r ECM protein in the lungs and is Vital for maintaining normal lung architecture (65). In
278 lungs, the maj ority 0f collagen-produeing cells differentiate from the resident precursor cells of
279 mesenchymal origin in response to injury (64). Up—regulation 0f 0014a] , 6014613, and 0016a]
280 among 4 collagen genes from FLT samples suggests that collagen synthesis was enhanced.
281 Furthermore, down-regulation of 5 out of 6 MMP genes responsible for degradation of collagen
282 may attenuate this process. Here, we could not rule out the possibility that the connective tissue-
283 like lesions and increased collagen are early signs of fibrogenesis. Such changes may reﬂect an
284 early response to spaceﬂight that includes dramatic alterations in gravitational conditions during
285 lift-off, orbital ﬂight, and landing. Reduced gravity is already known to result in ﬂuid shifts up
286 toward the chest and head, resulting in multiple physiological events that ineude changes in
287 blood volume and hemoglobin levels; these changes may result in compensatory and adaptive
288 remodeling in the lungs. In a previous study of mice ﬂown on Space Shuttle Endeavour (STS-
289 108), we found aberrations in several red blood cell measurements (21). These and other
290 findings, such as the high prevalence of astronaut anemia (seen as early as 24 hours after launch),
291 suggest an imbalance between 02 and C02 levels. Since connective tissue around blood vessels
292 is easily affected by factors circulating within the vessels, it seems possible that low oxygen
293 concentration could be among these factors. Although radiation can induce ECM changes similar
294 to those noted in the present study and the FLT mice were undoubtedly exposed to a higher dose
295 than the GRD controls, the observed changes are much more likely due to altered gravity and
296 oxygen availability.

297 Numerous studies have demonstrated that irradiation can cause inﬂammation and
298 development of ﬁbrosis that is characterized by imbalance between deposition and breakdown of
299 ECM components (3, 15, 28, 44). Thiekened walls of arterioles may be due to accumulation of
300 collagen in the tunica intima and tunioa media, resulting in reduced lumen diameter. However,
301 although expression of F4/ 80 (a maerophage-speoifio marker) was higher in bone marrow
302 collected from these same FLT animals (47), histopathologioal changes in the lung were not
303 accompanied by inﬂammatory cell inﬁltration. Recent experimental evidence suggests that
304 inﬂammation may not be necessary or sufﬁcient for progression to ﬁbrosis (4); overexpression
305 of the potent profibrotio mediator, TGF-Bl, for example, leads to progressive fibrosis in mice,
306 without any signiﬁcant inﬂammatory component (60). However, it is tempting to speculate that
307 more inﬂammation would occur in FLT mice as a later consequence of spaceﬂight.
308 RT-PCR data shows that expression of about 38.6 % of the characterized genes encoding
309 adhesion molecules were significantly altered (12 up—regulated and 10 down-regulated among 57
310 examined genes). Among them, ncam] , an important multifunctional member of the 1g gene
311 superfamily, was the most highly expressed in lungs after spaceﬂight (4.55 fold-ohange). The
312 neural cell adhesion molecule (NCAM, also known as CD5 6) is abundantly expressed in the
313 central nervous system (CNS) during development (13, 69), and is also present in a variety of
314 adult neural and non-neural tissues (27, 39). The production of NCAM is dynamically regulated
315 in different tissues and changes in surface density of the molecule are known to produce
316 important alterations in cell adhesion (14, 69). Up—regulation of NCAM by reactive astrocytes
317 has been reported in a variety of animal models of neural degeneration and human CNS diseases
318 (13, 29, 54), promoting plasticity and remodeling in neural tissues (14, 54). So far, little is
319 known about roles of NCAM expression in lung tissue. In this study, the enhanced

"
"15","1 5
320 immunoreactivity of NCAM after spaceﬂight was predominantly distributed in type I
321 pneumoeytes and endothelial cells. NCAM expression can be regulated by hormones, growth
322 factors, and the ECM (26, 40, 55). Thus, whether up—regulation of NCAM in the lungs was a
323 primary response to spaceﬂight factors, or secondary to other factors such as ECM remodeling
324 remains to be determined.
325 In addition to ncam] , mRNA levels of cell adhesion molecules, itga3, itgb4,fn1, lamb3, and
326 entpd] , were elevated by more than 1.5 fold in lungs of FLT mice; although the enhancements
327 were not dramatic, they were statistically signiﬁcant (P < 0.05). In contrast, lama], 5616, and
328 vcam] were markedly decreased with fold-change greater than 2 in FLT mice as compared with
329 the GRD controls (Table 2). VCAM-l is up—regulated on endothelial cells following
330 inﬂammatory stimuli and is involved in monocyte and lymphocyte migration. Adhesion
331 molecules such as VCAM-l must be expressed on vascular endothelium prior to leukocyte
332 extravasation, a process known as diapedesis. The down-regulation of sele and vcam] may
333 compromise recruitment of inﬂammatory cells, since the proteins derived from these genes are
334 involved in leukocyte interactions with vascular endothelial cells, migration to sites of injury,
335 and regulation of immune responses (48, 51, 63). This premise is consistent with the lack of
336 marked inﬂammatory inﬁltration in FLT mice. Collectively, these ﬁndings suggest that cell-to-
337 cell communication in the lungs, and possibly also cell trafﬁcking, were demonstrably different
338 shortly after return from spaceﬂight.
339 In this study, the genes for integrin subunits Ot3 and [34 were up—regulated and the gene for
340 0Q was down-regulated in the FLT mice. Integrins are heterodimerie transmembrane molecules,
341 consisting of OC and B subunits, and are divided into subfamilies according to the characteristics
342 of their B subunit. They serve as cell receptors for many proteins, such as the 1g superfamily

"
"16","16
343 adhesion molecules and ECM proteins including ﬁbronectin, Vitroneotin, laminin, collagen, and
344 fibrinogen. Therefore, proper expression of integrins is important in oell-oell adhesion and cell-
345 matrix interactions. Since single subunit genes were assessed, it is difﬁcult to speculate on the
346 possible consequences associated With spaceﬂight. However, it is clear that such changes in
347 subunit expression could affect integrin binding to speciﬁc ligands. In addition, alterations of
348 integrin ligands (e.g., B3 of ﬁbronectin and laminin up—regulated; 0C1 of laminin down-regulated)
349 residing on the basement membrane Within lungs from the FLT mice could inﬂuence oell-ECM
350 interaction. Similarly to ﬁbronectin, laminin is also a maj or constituent of the basement
351 membrane and is capable of interacting With cellular receptors such as integrins and other
352 extracellular ligands. Changes in expression of laminin subunits may perturb dynamic
353 metabolism of the basement membrane, leading in disruption of its integrity. The basement
354 membrane is a complex and dynamic matrix of ECM that interfaces With epithelial, endothelial,
355 nerve, fat, and muscle cells to provide mechanical support and stability, structural
356 oompartmentalization, regulation of cellular activities, and a physical reservoir for growth
357 factors.
358 The above findings also suggest that the FLT mice may have experienced some degree of
359 lung remodeling. Lung ECM composition of the alveolar basement membrane is dramatically
360 altered in response to acute lung injury (7), followed by increased expression and deposition of
361 fibronectin and type I collagen by alveolar epithelial cells and fibroblasts. Furthermore, Hsu et
362 al. (24) found that ﬁbronectin may be degraded by binding MMPs (MMP-2, -9, and -13).
363 Reduced expression of MMP-9 and MMP-13 in our spaceﬂight mice, suggests that excessive
364 accumulation of ﬁbronectin due to decreased degradation could occur.

"

365 There was signiﬁcant up-/down-regulation of genes encoding a number of MMPs and
366 TIMPs in the FLT mice (Table 2). For most MMPs, with the notable exception of MMP-2,
367 transcriptional regulation and kinetic inhibition by TIMPs predominate (45). Although all MMPs
368 could be substrates of TIMP-3, TIMP-2 apparently binds primarily to pro-MMP-2. Therefore,
369 increased MMP-2 may result from down-regulation of TIMP-2. In contrast, down-regulation of
370 transcription for ﬁve other MMPs may be attributable to up—regulation of TIMP-3. It has been
371 hypothesized that TIMP-3 functions in a tissue-speoiﬁo fashion as a part of an acute response to
372 remodeling stimuli and regulates ECM remodeling during the folding of epithelia (2, 37, 76).
373 Up—regulation of the gene encoding ADAMTS-2 by spaceﬂight supports the possibility that
374 more prooollagen was converted into collagen, and then assembled into collagen ﬁbrils. Like
375 MMPs, ADAMTS-2, a disintegrin-like metallopeptidase with thrombospondin type 1 motif 2, is
376 a secreted metalloproteinase involved in the processing of prooollagen to collagen (10, 22, 67).
377 Thus, increased expression of the adamts2 gene may promote development of ﬁbrosis. In
378 addition, SPARC (secreted acidic cysteine rich glycoprotein) mRNA was signiﬁcantly up-
379 regulated in FLT mice. The anti-adhesive properties of SPARC inhibit spreading of many
380 different cell types on ECM (8, 34). SPARC also functions in early ﬁbrosis when ﬁbroblasts
381 migrate into ﬁbronectin-rioh exudates in the alveoli (32); SPARC binds to interstitial collagen,
382 especially type III (57). This glycoprotein has complex direct effects on ﬁbroblast proliferation
383 (16). Moreover, SPARC stimulates the synthesis of plasminogen activator inhibitor type I by
384 endothelium, which could contribute to the antiﬁbrinolytio alveolar milieu in idiopathic
385 pulmonary ﬁbrosis (21).
386 Although the TGF-Bl gene was not included in the array of 84 assessed genes associated
387 with adhesion molecules and ECM proteins, there was a trend for up—regulation of the gene for

"
"18","1 8
388 TGF-B induced factor (tgfbi) in FLT mice (p=0.0509 vs. GRD controls). It has been reported that
389 the human version of this gene (T GFBI) is up—regulated by TGF-Bl in a corneal epithelial cell
390 line (70). In addition, TGF-Bl is known to enhance production of CTGF (52), which was up-
391 regulated in the present study based on increased expression of its mRNA and protein. These
392 reports indirectly indicate that the gene for TGF-Bl was up—regulated. Furthermore, our previous
393 investigation showed that the TGF-Bl gene and protein in mouse lung tissue were increased by
394 space-relevant radiation (68). Therefore, immnunoreaetivity for TGF-Bl in the FLT and GRD
395 groups was of interest to us in the present study. Immnunostaining revealed that expression of
396 TGF-Bl and CTGF responsible for synthesis of ECM components was enhanced in FLT
397 samples, while transcription of more MMPs that break down ECM was decreased. The increased
398 expression of both mRNA and protein of CTGF indicates that spaceﬂight is capable of impacting
399 both transcription and post-transeriptional processesing 0f CTGF. CTGF is speciﬁcally induced
400 by TGF-B during tissue repair (25), and also plays a pivotal role in many ﬁbrotie diseases by
401 mediating TGF-B-indueed fibroproliferative effects (25, 36). The increase in both TGF-Bl and
402 CTGF may enhance synthesis of more ECM components and promote ﬁbroblast proliferation.
403 Therefore, it seems possible that spaceﬂight factors may increase risk for fibrogenesis by
404 enhancing production of TGF-Bl and CTGF. Moreover, MMP-2, which tends to be increased
405 during the early inﬂammatory and later ﬁbrotie phases (12, 58) and which was up—regulated in
406 the FLT mice, may be involved in the release and activation of TGF-Bl (74). This further
407 supports the possibility that spaceﬂight-associated stressors, including exposure to radiation that
408 is known to enhance expression of both TGF-Bl and MMP-2 (3, 68), could lead to compromised
409 lung function.

"

410 The lack of difference in expression of MMP-7 and MMP-9 proteins between the FLT and
411 GRD groups is not consistent with their mRNA levels that were markedly down-regulated in
412 FLT animals. Such an inconsistency in expression between genes and proteins of MMP-7 and
413 MMP-9 may result from persistence of the proteins at the time of assessment post-landing, in
414 spite of down-regulated gene expression. Unlike the above two enzymes, the time interval for
415 MMP-2 between gene and protein expression may be considerably shorter.
416 In conclusion, compromised lung function due to spaceﬂight may result from perturbation
417 of the balance between deposition and breakdown of the ECM and proﬁbrosis—like changes.
418 Although we cannot separate the effects of landing, take-off, residence in space, and oxygen
419 availability, significant changes were detected in lungs of mice a few hours after return from a
420 13-day mission. The up—/d0wn-regulati0n of genes important in cell adhesion and ECM
421 remodeling, as well as deposition of excessive amounts of collagen and TGF-Bl were clearly
422 evident. In the future, investigations should be performed 011 samples taken during ﬂight, after
423 long-term missions, and at later time points after landing.

659 Fig. 1. Photomicrographs of representative sections of mouse lung tissue. The 5 mm parafﬁn
660 sections were stained with hematoxylin and eosin (H & E) showing histopathology (top row),
661 Sirius Red staining exhibited deposition of collagen (middle row, dark red), and
662 immunohistochemistry presents distribution of CD45 positive leukocytes (bottom row, dark
663 brown). Lung tissues after spaceﬂight displayed proﬁbrosis-like changes consisting or
664 connective tissue and ﬁbroblasts (arrows), and more abundant and wider zones of collagen (dark
665 red) surrounding vascular vessels compared with control mice. No differences in distribution and
666 numbers of CD45 positive cells were found between the two groups. V: vascular vessels; GRD:
667 ground-control; FLT: spaceﬂight. Magniﬁcation 400X for all panels except upper right is 100X.
668
669 Fig. 2. Representative lung tissue sections immunohistochemically stained for TGF-Bl, CTGF,
670 and NCAM proteins. Increased immunoreactivity for all three of these proteins is evident in
671 lungs of FLT mice compared to GRD controls. TGF-Bl immunoreactivity is seen predominantly
672 in alveolar pneumocytes and bronchiolar epithelial cells. Vascular endothelial cells and
673 connective tissue in peribronchial and vascular regions also exhibit staining. CTGF protein was
674 expressed by bronchiolar epithelium and occasionally by alveolar macrophages.
675 Immunoreaetivity for NCAM is detected in pneumocytes, endothelial cells, basement membrane
676 and connective tissue. Bronchiolar epithelial cells display negative staining. TGF-Bl:
677 transforming growth faetor-Bl; CTGF: connective tissue growth factor; NCAM: neural cell
678 adhesion molecule; GRD: ground-control; FLT: spaceﬂight; B: bronchiolar epithelium; V:
679 vascular vessels. Magniﬁcation 400X.

681 Fig. 3. Location and expression of MMP proteins identiﬁed by immunohistochemical staining in
682 representative lung tissue sections. Positive cells for MMP-2, MMP-7, and MMP-9 were
683 predominantly restricted in bronchiolar epithelial cells and alveolar inﬂammatory cells (dark
684 brown). An increased intensity for MMP-2 immunostaining can be seen in FLT samples,
685 whereas no difference in staining intensity for MMP-7 and MMP-9 is seen between the two
686 groups. MMP: matrix metalloproteinase; GRD: ground-control; FLT: spaceﬂight; B: bronchiolar
687 epithelium; V: vascular vessels. Magniﬁcation 400X.
