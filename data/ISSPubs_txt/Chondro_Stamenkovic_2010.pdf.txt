Abstract ' ”I
AIM: The aim of this study was to analyze and compare the deposition of cartilage i v
-speciﬁc extracellular matrix components and cellular organization in scaffold-free ' ' ‘
neocartilage produced in microgravity and simulated microgravity. .
METHODS: Porcine chondrocytes were seeded (100 x 10(6)/mL) into cylindrical ‘
culture chambers (n = 8) and cultured in the following environments: (i)
microgravity during the Flight 78 (Cervantes mission) on the International Space
Station (ISS), (ii) simulated microgravity in a random positioning machine (RPM),
and (iii) normal gravity (1 9, control). After 16 days, each neocartilage tissue was
processed for histology, immunohistochemistry, quantitative real-time reverse
transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction, and histomorphometric analysis.
RESULTS: Weaker extracellular matrix staining of ISS neocartilage tissue was ;
noted compared with both Earth-cultivated tissues. Higher collagen II/I expression
ratios were observed in ISS samples compared with control tissue. Conversely,
higher aggrecan/versican gene expression profiles were seen in control 1 9
samples compared with microgravity samples. Cell density produced in
microgravity was signiﬁcantly reduced compared with the normal gravity
neocartilage tissues.
CONCLUSION: Tissue cultivated on the RPM showed intermediate characteristics
compared with ISS and 1 9 conditions. These data indicate that the RPM system
does not sustain microgravity. Although microgravity impacts the development of
in vitro generated cartilage, simulated microgravity using the RPM may be a useful
tool to produce cartilaginous tissue grafts with fewer cells.

Aim: The aim of this study was to analyze and compare the deposition of cartilage-speciﬁc extracellular matrix
components and cellular organization in scaffold-free neocartilage produced in microgravity and simulated
microgravity.
Methods: Porcine chondrocytes were seeded (100x106/mL) into cylindrical culture chambers (11 = 8) and cul—
tured in the following environments: (i) microgravity during the Flight 78 (Cervantes mission) on the Interna—
tional Space Station (155), (ii) simulated microgravity in a random positioning machine (RPM), and (iii) normal
gravity (1 g, control). After 16 days, each neocartilage tissue was processed for histology, immunohistochem-
istry, quantitative real—time reverse transcriptase—polymerase chain reaction, and histomorphometric analysis.
Results: Weaker extracellular matrix staining of ISS neocartilage tissue was noted compared with both Earth-
cultivated tissues. Higher collagen II/ I expression ratios were observed in 185 samples compared with control
tissue. Conversely, higher aggrecan/versican gene expression proﬁles were seen in control 1 3 samples com-
. pared with microgravity samples. Cell density produced in microgravity was significantly reduced compared

FIG. 5. Possible use of the RPM to engineer cartilage implants without scaffolds. Cell-based cartilage repair strategies
consist of collecting a biopsy from the donor (i), isolating the cells from the tissue (ii), and expanding the small quantities of
cells in monolayer cultures (iii) until sufﬁcient numbers are obtained for implant manufacture in bioreactor systems (iv). The
RPM may be employed to produce neotissue with fewer cells because the simulated microgravity spaces the cells further
apart. Moreover, if cells are expanded further in culture (v), the RPM may also allow for the production of larger cartilaginous
grafts that may be suitable to heal larger defects. Mechanical loading would also contribute to the formation of quality
