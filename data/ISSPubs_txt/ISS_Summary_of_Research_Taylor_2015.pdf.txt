ment may also affect the susceptibility of microorganisms within the spacecraft to antibiotics,
key components of ﬂown medical kits, and may modify the Virulence characteristics of bacteria
and other microorganisms that contaminate the fabric of the International Space Station and
other ﬂight platforms. This review will consider the impact of true and simulated microgravity
and other characteristics of the space ﬂight environment on bacterial cell behavior in relation
to the potential for serious infections that may appear during missions to astronomical objects
beyond low Earth orbit.

Introduction
A new chapter in human space ﬂight is opening: at one end of the spectrum, a ﬂedging
space tourism industry has emerged, and for the ﬁrst time in many years, the possi—
bility of exploration beyond low Earth orbit (LEO) is ﬁrmly on the agenda. As more
nation states become involved, the momentum of manned space ﬂight Will inevitably
increase and Will eventually extend humanity’s reach far into the solar system. The
current focus of human activity in space is the International Space Station (188), the
largest, most complex international scientiﬁc and engineering project conceived to
date. The 188 has been continuously occupied since November 2000 and is likely to
function as a research base for another 5—10 years. The 188 provides a platform for
on—orbit long—duration (up to 215 days) studies to examine the impact of the space
ﬂight environment on human health and physiology and an opportunity to develop
countermeasures that Will sustain crew health during voyages into deep space. Although
the enormous cost of building and maintaining the 188 has imposed severe ﬁnancial
and political constraints on planning missions beyond LEO, intent has been signaled
