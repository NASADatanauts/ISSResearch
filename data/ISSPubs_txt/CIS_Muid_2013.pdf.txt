Abstract
The effects of spaceﬂight on cardiovascular health are not necessarily seen immediately after astronauts
have returned but can be delayed. It is important to investigate the long term effects of spaceﬂight
on protein and gene expression of inﬂammation and endothelial activation as a predictor for the
development of atherosclerosis and potential cardiovascular problems. The Objectives of this study
were to investigate the (a) protein and gene expression of inﬂammation and endothelial activation,
(b) expression of nuclear factor kappa B (NFKB), signal transducer and activator of transcription—3
(STAT—3) and endothelial nitric OXide synthase (eNOS) in human umbilical vein endothelial cells
(HUVEC) 3 months post—space ﬂight travel compared to ground controls. HUVEC cultured on
microcarriers in ﬂuid processing apparatus were ﬂown to the International Space Station (188)
by the Soyuz TMA—ll rocket. After landing, the cells were detached from microcarriers and re—
cultured in T—25 cm2 culture ﬂasks (Revived HUVEC). Soluble protein expression of IL—6, TNF-OL,
ICAM—l, VCAM—l and e—selectin were measured by ELISA. Gene expression of these markers and
in addition NFKB, STAT—3 and eNOS were measured. Spaceﬂight induced IL—6 and ICAM—1 remain
elevated even after 3 months post spaceﬂight travel and this is mediated Via STAT—3 pathway. The
downregulation of eNOS expression in revived HUVEC cells suggests a reduced protection of the
cells and the surrounding vessels against future insults that may lead to atherosclerosis. It would be
crucial to explore preventive measures, in relation to atherosclerosis and its related complications.
