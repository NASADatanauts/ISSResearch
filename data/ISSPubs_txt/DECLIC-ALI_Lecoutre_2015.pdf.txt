Near the critical point of ﬂuids, critical opalescence results in light attenuation, or turbidity increase, that can
be used to probe the universality of critical behavior. Turbidity measurements in SF6 under weightlessness
conditions on board the International Space Station are performed to appraise such behavior in terms of
both temperature and density distances from the critical point. Data are obtained in a temperature range, far
(1 K) from and extremely close (a few ,uK) to the phase transition, unattainable from previous experiments
on Earth. Data are analyzed with renormalization-group matching classical-to-critical crossover models of the
universal equation of state. It results that the data in the unexplored region, which is a minute deViant from
the critical density value, still show adverse effects for testing the true asymptotic nature of the critical point
phenomena.
