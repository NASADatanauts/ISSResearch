Relative fold increases of gene expression from activated T cells in onboard normal gravity compared with those in microgravity were computed
using gene array bioinformatics. Potential hsa—miR—2l—5p target genes shown have differentially regulated between normal gravity and microgravity
conditions. T cells from 3 independent donors were ﬂown in space and activated with concanavalin A/anti—CD28 in microgravity or in normal gravity.
Genes that had altered expression between microgravity and normal gravity were identiﬁed by 1—way ANOVA (£0.05) with Benjamini—Hochberg multiple
test correction and post hoc Tukey test. FASLG was not quite signiﬁcant at P S 0.05 but was signiﬁcant at P S 0.06 and thus is included in the list. Potential
hsa—miRNA—2l—5p targets were identiﬁed using TargetScan (predicted miRNA targets) and TarBase (conﬁrmed miRNA—gene interactions).
