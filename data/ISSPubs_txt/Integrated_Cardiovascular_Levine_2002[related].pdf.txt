Orthostatic intolerance is common when astronauts return to Earth: after brief spaceﬂight, up to

two-thirds are unable to remain standing for 10 min. Previous research suggests that susceptible

individuals are unable to increase their systemic vascular resistance and plasma noradrenaline

concentrations above pre-ﬂight upright levels. In this study, we tested the hypothesis that

adaptation to the microgravity of space impairs sympathetic neural responses to upright posture on

Earth. We studied six astronauts ~72 and 23 days before and on landing day after the 16 day

Neurolab space shuttle mission. We measured heart rate, arterial pressure and cardiac output, and

calculated stroke volume and total peripheral resistance, during supine rest and 10 min of 60 deg

upright tilt. Muscle sympathetic nerve activity was recorded in ﬁve subjects, as a direct measure of

sympathetic nervous system responses. As in previous studies, mean (i S.E.M.) stroke volume was

lower (46 i 5 vs. 76 i 3 ml, P = 0.017) and heart rate was higher (93 i 1 vs. 74 i 4 beats min_l,

P = 0.002) during tilt after spaceﬂight than before spaceﬂight. Total peripheral resistance during tilt

post ﬂight was higher in some, but not all astronauts (1674 i 256 vs. 1372 i 62 dynes s cm‘s,

P = 0.32). No crew member exhibited orthostatic hypotension 0r presyncopal symptoms during the

10 min of postﬂight tilting. Muscle sympathetic nerve activity was higher post ﬂight in all subjects,

in supine (27 i 4 vs. 17 i 2 bursts min‘l, P = 0.04) and tilted (46 i 4 vs. 38 i 3 bursts min‘l,

P = 0.01) positions. A strong (r2 = 0.91—1.00) linear correlation between left ventricular stroke

volume and muscle sympathetic nerve activity suggested that sympathetic responses were

appropriate for the haemodynamic challenge of upright tilt and were unaffected by spaceﬂight. We

conclude that after 16 days of spaceﬂight, muscle sympathetic nerve responses to upright tilt are

normal.
