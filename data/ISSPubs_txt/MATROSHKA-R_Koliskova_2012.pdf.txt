Abstract
The health risks associated with exposure to various components of space radiation are of great concern when planning manned long—
term interplanetary missions, such as future missions to Mars. Since it is not possible to measure the radiation environment inside of
human organs in deep space, simulations based on radiation transport/interaction codes coupled to phantoms of tissue equivalent mate—
rials are used. However, the calculated results depend on the models used in the codes, and it is therefore necessary to verify their validity
by comparison with measured data. The goal of this paper is to compare absorbed doses obtained in the MATROSHKA—R experiment
performed at the International Space Station (ISS) with simulations performed with the three—dimensional Monte Carlo Particle and
Heavy—Ion Transport code System (PHITS). The absorbed dose was measured using passive detectors (packages of thermoluminescent
and plastic nuclear track detectors) placed on the surface of the spherical tissue equivalent phantom MATROSHKA-R, which was
exposed aboard the ISS in the Service Zvezda Module from December 2005 to September 2006. The data calculated by PHITS assuming
an ISS shielding of 3 g/cm2 and 5 g/cm2 aluminum mass thickness were in good agreement with the measurements. Using a simpliﬁed
geometrical model of the ISS, the inﬂuence of variations in altitude and wall mass thickness of the ISS on the calculated absorbed dose
was estimated. The uncertainties of the calculated data are also discussed; the relative expanded uncertainty of absorbed dose in phantom
was estimated to be 44% at a 95% conﬁdence level.
