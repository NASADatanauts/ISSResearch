ABSTRACT Wisconsin Center for Space Automation and Robotics

Advanced ASTROCULTURETM (ADVASC) plant growth development of a large plant growth unit for space-
unit is a two Middeck Locker insert developed by the based applications. The concept 0f the Advanced
Wisconsin Center for Space Automation and Robotics at ASTROCULTURETM (ADVASC) was formed in early
the University of Wisconsin-Madison. It has been 1998; the prototype was developed in early 1999, the
deveIoped to take advantage of pIant research first flight—qualified payload was completed in late 2000,
opportunities during the early assembly phase of the and the second flight—qualified payload was completed in
International Space Station (ISS) when the ISS late 2001-
resources and up/down mass availability are limited.
ADVASC provides a large enclosed plant growth ADVASC iS configured as tWO singIe-Middeck-Locker
chamber. Control software provides precise control of (MDL) inserts installed in a standard EXPRESS Rack,
environmental parameters in the plant chamber, with one insert containing the support systems (identified
including temperature, relative humidity, light, fluid as ADVASC-SS) and the other containing the plant

Auto—prime technologies eliminate the need for power in Figure 1- ThUS, inserts can be transported to and

scrubber used in ADVASC is a WCSAR-developed
technology (Zhou at e|., 2003) that uses modified
titanium dioxide (TiOz) as photocatalysts, activated by
ultraviolet (UV) irradiation, for the degradation of
_' , contaminant hydrocarbons, primarily the ethylene
' (C2H4). The active material, the modified TiOZ, is not
consumed during the operation because it is the
' catalyst, which makes this technology particularly
attractive to space-based applications where the
