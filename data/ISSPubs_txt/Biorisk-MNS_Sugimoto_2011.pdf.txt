Abstract
Barley seeds were exposed to outer space for 13 months in a vented metal container without a climate control system to assess the risk
of physiological and genetic mutation during long—term storage in space. The space—stored seeds (SO generation), with an 82% germina—
tion rate in 50 seeds, lost about 20% of their weight after the exposure. The germinated seeds showed normal growth, heading, and rip-
ening. The harvested seeds (Sl generation) also germinated and reproduced (S2 generation) as did the ground—stored seeds. The culm
length, ear length, number of seed, grain weight, and fertility of the plants from the space—stored seeds were not signiﬁcantly different
from those of the ground—stored seeds in each of the SO and SI generation. Furthermore, the SI and S2 space—stored seeds respectively
showed similar [i—glucan content to those of the ground—stored seeds. Ampliﬁed fragment length polymorphism analysis with 16 primer
combinations showed no speciﬁc fragment that appears or disappears signiﬁcantly in the DNA isolated from the barley grown from the
space—stored seeds. Though these data are derived from nine SO space—stored seeds in a single exposure experiment, the results demon—
strate the preservation of barley seeds in outer space for 13 months without phenotypic or genotypic changes and with healthy and Vig—
orous growth in space.
