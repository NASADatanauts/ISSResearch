The transport processes that occur at small length scales are greatly inﬂuenced by interfacial and
intermolecular forces. Surface roughness at the nanoscale generates additional intermolecular
interactions that arise due to the increased surface area. In this work, we have experimentally studied
how the magnitude as well as the shape of surface roughness inﬂuences the microscale transport
processes that occur in the contact line region of a liquid corner meniscus. The surface roughness
contribution to the interaction potential was calculated and a direct relationship between the wetting
properties of the liquid and the underlying surface properties was Obtained. Since the underlying
roughness alters the surface potential, the shape of the meniscus and in turn, the resulting capillary
and disjoining pressure forces also Changed. Atomic force microscopy was utilized to Obtain a
detailed Characterization of the shape of the prepared surfaces. Surface morphology features were
obtained from a height—height correlation function. These features were related to the wetting and
transport properties of the meniscus at the contact line. Finally, the modiﬁed capillary and disjoining
pressure forces on the structured surfaces were observed to inﬂuence the evaporative heat transfer
from the corner meniscus. © 2010 American Institute of Physics. [doi:10.1063/ 1.3392771]
