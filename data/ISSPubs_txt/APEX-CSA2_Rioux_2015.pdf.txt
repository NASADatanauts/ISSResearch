Fig. 1. 1: Six ISS—based seedlings taken in front of a gridded whiteboard where each square is equal to 1 cm2. Red lines = current shoots; blue lines = n — 1 shoots; red arrow
= zone where the shoot seems to bend somewhat more towards a vertical position; black arrows = some of the needles that were measured appear in black. 2: Schematic
illustration showing the connections between the needles and the leaf traces (vascular tissues) in a young conifer shoot. Arrow = cushion at the base of a needle. Adapted
from Esau (1977) and Camefort (1977). 3—5: Cross—sections of current shoots; line B seedlings grown in the 155 (3—4) and as a ground control (5). 3: The black arrow points
to a leaf trace located between two resin canals (R). The arrowhead shows a vascular bundle. The vascular cambium has also started to produce some secondary xylem and
phloem tissues. P = pith; red arrow = cushion. 4: The arrow points to the xylem within the leaf trace of 3. Arrowhead = starch sheath cells. 5: Another leaf trace covered by
obvious starch sheath cells. In the latter, the arrowheads point to a few amyloplasts. Arrow = xylem present within the leaf trace; asterisk = the content of a cell intensively
stained with toluidine blue, suggesting the presence of phenols.

Fig. 2. 6—8: Longitudinal tangential sections of current shoots. 6—7: Seedlings of line C as ground controls. 6: A low—magniﬁcation view of the stem showing two horizontally—
oriented leaf traces (black arrows) within the bumps occurring at the base of needles and one vertically—oriented leaf trace (red arrow) shown at higher magniﬁcation in the
next micrograph. R = resin canals; C = cushions. 7: The amyloplasts have sedimented (arrows) in several starch sheath cells as well as nuclei found just above them (arrow—
heads). The red arrow points to the primary xylem elements within the leaf trace. 8: Amyloplasts (arrows) and nuclei (arrowheads) are randomly distributed within starch
sheath cells in a white spruce, line B, grown in the 155. The red arrow points to the xylem within the leaf trace.

Fig. 3. 9—11: Longitudinal sections of the apical part of roots. 9: Ground—control seedling (KSC) of line B. The drawing surrounds the columella in the root cap that appears
to be three to four stories of cells. The inset represents this area where the arrowheads point to amyloplasts that have sedimented, which seems to indicate that the
gravity vector was about in the direction pointed to by the arrow at the bottom right of the ﬁgure. 10: A ground—control seedling (LFC) of line B. The arrows point to
some amyloplasts, where the starch grains appear as white dots that have sedimented at the bottom of columella cells. Most of the amyloplasts seem intermingled with
dark—stained compounds. Huge nuclei were found just above these plastids, one of which (green arrow) is obviously in a state of division as shown by the presence of
condensed chromosomes. Some plastids (arrowheads) appear to be squeezed between the nucleus and the cell wall. 11: A seedling (line B) grown in space. Most amyloplasts
of the columella cells have a dark appearance and are located clearly all around the cells (arrowhead) or some are either observed at the bottom or at the top of the cells
(red arrows). Nuclei are mostly situated in the middle of the cells. Amyloplasts in cells around the columella have a more whitish appearance (black arrows) and are also
randomly distributed within them.

Fig. 4. 12—15: Ultrastructural observations of longitudinal sections. 12: A columella cell of the root of a ground—based (LFC) seedling, line B. Amyloplasts (arrows) situated
close to the irregular bottom wall (w), the right part of which is just outside of the ﬁgure. Two large vacuoles with phenol—like compounds also surround these amyloplasts,
with a hole (*) present in the right—hand one. The bar has been placed within such a hole occurring among phenol—like compounds in an adjacent cell. A part of the nucleus
(N) is shown at the top of the ﬁgure. 13: A starch sheath cell of the shoot of a seedling (line B) grown in the 155. These amyloplasts (arrows), situated mostly at the top of
the cell, are closely surrounded by phenol—like compounds present at the periphery of a vacuole (V). The envelope of these amyloplasts appears to be partly (black arrows) or
completely (white arrow) surrounded by such electron—opaque compounds. 14: Shoot of a seedling (line A) grown in the ISS. Amyloplasts (arrows) are randomly distributed
in a large sheath cell found adjacent to a leaf trace into which xylem elements (x) (tracheids) with scalariform secondary wall thickenings are obvious. 15: A columella cell
of a ground—based (LFC) seedling, line B. Endoplasmic reticula (black arrows) are found close to the amyloplast envelope. The amyloplast is not in the vicinity of the plasma
membrane (arrowhead) next to the bottom cell wall (w). Electron—opaque phenol—like compounds are also obvious between the amyloplast and mitochondria (white arrows).
