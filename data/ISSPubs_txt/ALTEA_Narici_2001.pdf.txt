Abstract

The ALTEA project studies the problems related to possible functional damage to the Central Nervous System (CNS) due to particle
radiation in space environment.

The project is a large international and multi-disciplinary collaboration. The ALTEA instrumentation is an helmet—shaped multi-
sensor device that Will measure concurrently the dynamics of the functional status of the Visual system and the passage of each
particle through the brain Within a pre-determined energy Window.

ALTEA is scheduled to ﬂy in the International Space Station in February 2003. One part Of the multy-sensor device, one Of
the advanced silicon telescopes, Will be launched in the 188 in early 2002 and serve as test for the final device and as discriminating
dosimeter for the particle ﬂuences Within the ISS.

KEYWORDS: Space radiation, electrophysiology in space, light ﬂashes, long manned ﬂights.
