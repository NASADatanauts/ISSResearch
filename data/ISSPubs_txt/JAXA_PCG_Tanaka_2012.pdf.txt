Abstract Growing high quality crystals is a bottleneck in the multi-stepped process of
three-dimensional structural analyses of protein. It is known that a microgravity environment may
maintain ideal depletion zones of protein and impurity around a growing crystal and the ﬁltering
effect of these depletion zones may contribute to obtaining high-resolution X-ray diffracting
crystals with superior internal order. The effects of these depletion zones around growing crystals
are thought to be the main mechanisms for the improvement of crystal quality in microgravity. A
competition between the diffusion of protein molecules in the solution (indexed by the diffusion
coefﬁcient, D) and the adsorption of those into the growing crystal (indexed by the kinetic
coeffcient, ,8) decides the extent of depletion zones. Lower D values and higher ,8 values indicate
that these effects are more obvious in numerical analyses. Therefore we use the D/,8 value as an
index for these effects. The most effective method of lowering the D/,8 value is using Viscous
precipitant reagents, such as a high molecular weight polyethylene glycol (PEG) to decrease the D
value and using highly homogenous protein samples to increase the ,8 value. In this report, we
brieﬂy introduce simple yet practical methods of estimating D and ,8 values followed by a numerical
analysis to understand the ﬁltration effects, and the results of crystallization experiments in
microgravity when controlling the diffusive ﬁeld around the growing crystals using the D/,8 value as
an index.
Introduction

Protein crystallography is the major technique used to elucidate three-dimensional (3-D)
structures of protein molecules. High-resolution data derived from crystals give us 3-D structural
information of protein functions. To know these functions in detail, a high-resolution X-ray
diffraction dataset, which is obtained by using high-quality crystals, is essential. However, the most
critical roadblock for structural analysis is crystallization, of which only 20% of attempts are
successful [1].

It has been said that the microgravity environment may have positive effects on growing
high-quality crystals [2,3]. As a crystal grows, protein molecules are incorporated into the crystal
surface so that the concentration depletion zones of protein and impurities are formed around the
crystal in a convection-ﬁee environment such as microgravity, which in the terrestrial environment
are dissolved [4,5,6]. Therefore, in microgravity, the incorporation of the molecules into the crystal
highly depends on the diffusive transport, so that the incorporated molecules may be allocated in
order and the impurity uptake may be suppressed, resulting in highly ordered crystals.

J apan Aerospace Exploration Agency (J AXA) has been performing High-Quality Protein Crystal
Growth experiments on the International Space Station (188) since 2003. Throughout our work to
improve crystallization technology, we numerically analyzed the concentration depletion zones, and
found that the high Viscosity of the solution indexed by the low diffusion coefﬁcient (D), and the
high puriﬁcation level of the protein sample indexed by the high kinetic constant (,8) are the keys
for obtaining high-quality protein crystals in microgravity. Therefore, we use the D/,8 value as an
index for the controlled diffusive ﬁeld in crystal growth.

In this report, we introduce how to control the diffusive ﬁeld around the crystals by optimizing
the crystallization condition to enhance the effects of microgravity.
Materials and Methods
Estimation of Diffusion Coefﬁcient (D)
The diffusion pair method was used to measure the diffusion coefﬁcients (D) [7]. From our
experimental results, D can be estimated as

Dprotein is the diffusion coefﬁcient of the protein molecule; Mp, and MPEG are the molecular weight
of the protein and PEG, respectively; and CPEG is the concentration of PEG.
Estimation of Kinetic Constant (8)

The ,8 value in this study corresponds to p83, and P6198, where p is the slope of the dislocation
hilloek and ,8S,is the step kinetic constant in ChenOV’s report [5]; Pek is the kinetic Peelet number
and ,8 is the kinetic constant in ReViakine et al.’s report [8]. In our study, to simplify the estimation
of the ,8 value on the ground, we assumed that: crystals are spherical and growing in an isotropic
manner; the concentration of the crystallization solution is uniform for density-driven convection;
and the uptake of protein molecules into a crystal is a
linear function of the protein concentration in the __S_ ——- 'W“

selected to be observed, with their radii measured at every observation. After the crystals stopped
growing, the ﬁnal radii were measured, and the protein concentration of the solution remaining in

ﬁnal size of the crystals (R(oo)) were 0.46, 0.40, 0.17 and 0.23 (mm), the time required for growing
to half the size of the ﬁnal crystals (131/2) was 40.6, 72.6, 11.5 and 52.7 (hrs), and the protein
concentrations after the crystals stopped growing (Ce) were 4.55, 5.45, 3.34 and 4.84 (mg/ml) for
each crystallization condition, respectively. Using these values, the ,8 value was calculated with the

equation (4). As shown in Table 1, if the highly puriﬁed —
protein sample was used for crystallization, the ,8 value
was twice as large in the sodium chloride solution without
PEG 4000, and was three times as large in the sodium
chloride solution with PEG 4000. This may be because
the impurities in the commercially available sample
blocked kink—sites and reduced the growth velocity [12].

The ,8 value was almost consistent with the previous
reports [5,8].

Lysozyme Crystallization in Microgravity
The lysozyme crystal in Fig. 4 was obtained using sodium chloride as a precipitant with PEG in
microgravity and diffracted up to 0.88 A which was a large improvement over the ground-grown
control crystal (1.08 A). From our experience with more than 45 kinds of crystallization trials in
microgravity, if the D/ﬂ is less than 3 mm, the microgravity environment works positively on
growing high-quality crystals in 75% of samples. Therefore, in the case of the lysozyme
crystallization (R(oo)=0.19 mm), the D/ﬂ of highly puriﬁed protein with PEG 4000, which was 0.23
(mm), indicated that this crystallization condition would work best in microgravity, among the four
conditions. For crystals growing in the sodium chloride solution without, PEG, both the crystals
grown in microgravity and on the ground diffracted X-rays up to 1.0 A. Although the protein
sample was highly puriﬁed, no difference was observed between these crystals, probably because
the ﬁltering effects of the depletion zones were not sufﬁcient to enhance the effects of microgravity.
Application to Other Proteins to Control Diffusive Field
There are some other examples of crystallization which showed an improvement in the crystal
quality in microgravity through protein puriﬁcation and the usage of high-Viscous additives.
In 2007, highly-puriﬁed human hematopoietic prostaglandin D synthase (H-PGDS) was crystallized
with 15% PEG 6000 in the crystallization solution on board the Russian Seryice Module on the 188
for 12 weeks, resulting in high-quality crystals which diffracted beyond 1.1 A resolution [13]. In the
same experiment, a ground-grown crystal was crystallized as a control and it diffracted up to 1.5 A.
In this case, the crystallization reagent was originally PEG 6000, which, from the beginning,
worked positively for growing good crystals. The calculated D/ﬂ was reduced to 0.39 mm by further
puriﬁcation of the protein, which might positively work for obtaining higher quality crystals in
microgravity. The crystal radii of the microgravity-grown and the ground-grown crystals were
about 0.19 mm.
Also in 2007, highly puriﬁed mouse lipocalin-type prostaglandin D synthase (L-PGDS) was
crystallized with 40% PEG 8000 in the crystallization solution on the 188 for 11 weeks, and
high-resolution crystals, which diffracted up to 1.1 A resolution, were obtained [14]. In the same
experiment, the ground-grown control crystal diffracted up to 1.3 A. The radii of the crystals grown
in microgravity and on the ground were about 0.31 mm. In the previous crystallization experiment
of this protein, it was crystallized in a sodium malonate solution and the crystal diffracted to 2.3 A.
The further puriﬁcation of the protein and the addition of PEG 8000 reduced the D/ﬂ from 2.90 to
0.55 mm.
Therefore, we may conclude that we can use the microgravity environment effectively to obtain
high-quality protein crystals if we prepare a highly puriﬁed protein sample and a high-Viscous
crystallization solution indexed by the D/ﬂ. However there were some other examples of

"

crystallization in microgravity that did not yield high-quality crystals even though the D/ﬂ was a
preferable value. There must still be other variables to consider to further improve crystallization in
microgravity.
