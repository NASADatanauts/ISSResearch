Abstract: In the space experiment ‘Spores in artiﬁcial meteorites’ (SPORES), spores of the fungus
T richoderma longibrachiatum were exposed to low-Earth orbit for nearly 2 years on board the EXPOSE-R
facility outside of the International Space Station. The environmental conditions tested in space were: space
vacuum at 10—7—10_4 Pa or argon atmosphere at 105 Pa as inert gas atmosphere, solar extraterrestrial
ultraviolet (UV) radiation at 7» > 110 nm or 7» > 200 nm with ﬂuences up to 5.8 X 108 J n1_2 , cosmic radiation
of a total dose range from 225 to 320 mGy, and temperature ﬂuctuations from —25 to +50°C, applied
isolated or in combination. Comparable control experiments were performed on ground. After retrieval,
Viability of spores was analysed by two methods: (i) ethidium bromide staining and (ii) test of germination
capability. About 30% of the spores in vacuum survived the space travel, if shielded against insolation.
However, in most cases no signiﬁcant decrease was observed for spores exposed in addition to the full
spectrum of solar UV irradiation. As the spores were exposed in clusters, the outer layers of spores may have
shielded the inner part. The results give some information about the likelihood of lithopansperniia, the
natural transfer of micro-organisnis between planets. In addition to the parameters of outer space, sojourn
time in space seems to be one of the limiting parameters.
