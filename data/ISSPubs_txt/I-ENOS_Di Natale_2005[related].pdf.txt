Summary

Background: Previous ﬁndings have shown that the body odor of patients affected by schizophrenia contains
some speciﬁc compounds. Chemical sensor technology has proved to be able to Classify different
odours. We investigated the possibility of using a Chemical sensor array to detect body odor alter-
ation in schizophrenic patients.

Material/ MBthOdS: The sweat of subjects was sampled and analysed by Gas Chromatography—Mass Spectrometry (GC—MS)
and by an array of cross-selective gas sensors. A total of 27 individuals were involved in the experi-
ment: 9 schizophrenics, 9 with other mental disorders, and 9 controls.

Results: GC—MS analysis showed a richer composition for the sweat of schizophrenic patients. Nevertheless,
the individuation of speciﬁc markers was unsuccessful. On the other hand, statistical analysis of
cross-selective gas sensor data provided a complete Classiﬁcation of schizophrenic patients with re-
spect to the other three groups.

COI‘ICIUSiOI‘IS: The alteration of body odor in schizophrenic patients was conﬁrmed by GC—MS and Chemical sen-
sor array. Results show that the alteration is complex and cannot be limited to a single compound,
but rather to a global variation of the body odor.
