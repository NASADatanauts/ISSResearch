Abstract
The properties of structural materials are to a large extent determined by the solid microstructure so that the understanding of the
fundamental physics of microstructure formation is critical in the engineering of materials. Also, microstructure selection occurs
during the dynamical growth process so that in situ observation of spatio—temporal evolution of the solid—liquid interface shape
is necessary. Under terrestrial conditions convection effects dominate in bulk samples, Which prevents precise characterization of
microstructure selection. Diffusion—controlled experiments in thin samples give microstructures that are neither 2D nor 3D. Rigor-
ous theoretical models using the phase—ﬁeld method have shown that the fundamental physics of pattern selection in 2D and 3D is
signiﬁcantly different. A benchmark experimental study in bulk samples is thus required under low gravity conditions. In the frame
of the joint work of DSIP and MISOL3D projects, respectively, selected by NASA and CNES, microgravity experiments in a model
transparent system are planned on ISS using the directional solidiﬁcation insert (DSI) in the DECLIC facility. The critical aspects of
hardware design, the key fundamental issues identiﬁed through lg—eXperiments, the proposed study on ISS, and the results of rig—
orous theoretical modeling are presented.
