ABSTRACT

We present the Observation of an extraordinary luminous soft X—ray transient,
MAXI J0158—744, by the Monitor 0f All—sky X—ray Image (MAXI) en 2011
November 11. This transient is Characterized by a soft X—ray spectrum, a short
duration (1.3 X 103 s < ATd < 1.10 X 104 s), a very rapid rise (< 5.5 X 103 s),
and a huge peak luminosity of 2 x 1040 erg s‘1 in 0.7—7.0 keV band. With Swift
Observations and Optical spectroscopy from the Small and Moderate Aperture
Research Telescope System (SMARTS), we conﬁrmed that the transient is a nova
explosion, on a White dwarf in a binary With a Be star, located near the Small
Magellanic Cloud. An extremely early turn—on 0f the super—soft X—ray source
(SSS) phase (< 0.44 d), the short SSS phase duration of about one month, and
a 0.92 keV neon emission line found in the third MAXI scan, 1296 s after the
ﬁrst detection, suggest that the explosion involves a small amount of ejeeta and
is produced on an unusually massive O—Ne White dwarf Close to, or possibly over,
the Chandrasekhar limit. We propose that the huge luminosity detected With
MAXI was due to the ﬁreball phase, a direct manifestation of the ignition 0f the
thermonuclear runaway process in a nova explosion.

1. Introduction

Classical or recurrent novae are typically Characterized by a rapid Optical increase of 6
ma_nitudes or more followed by a decline to quiescence over the next 3 — 300 days
i). They originate from an secreting binary system consisting of a White dwarf (WD)
and a mass—losing late—type companion star. Novae are triggered by thermonuclear runawa s

TNR lastin_ N 100 s at the bottom of the accreted mass layer on the WD surface
h; h). The TNR blows Off the outer layer of the accumulated
mass and causes an Optically thick Wind expanding up to N 100RQ. It produces bright
blackbody emission (N 1038 erg s_l, comparable to the Eddington luminosit Of a 1M9
Object) at Optical bands. This Optical nova phase lasts for N 3 — 300 days (h).
At the same time a blast wave, caused by a nova explosion in a dense Circumstellar medium,
sometimes produces shOCk—indueed etieall —thiI1 hard X—ray emission lastin_ N 10 days,
as Observed in RS Ophiuehi and V407 Cyg _->, for
example. After the Wind stops, the photesphere shrinks down to the WD surface (N 103 — 104
km), and the blackbody temperature increases to N 100 eV, meaning the emission is in the
soft X—ray energy range. This transient phase With soft X—ray emission is called the suer—
soft source hase SSS phase) and it lasts about N 100 — 1000 days _i;
—h). When the nuclear burning stops, the SSS phase ends. Novae are
Classiﬁed into speed Classes by the decay time scale of their Optical light curves (--).
Faster novae shew earlier turn—ons and shorter durations of the SSS phase. For example, the
fastest nova U See showed a turn—on 0f the SSS phase at 10 days and had a duration of about
25 days (—-). In general, the evolution of Classical/reeurrent novae has been
established, except for the early phase. At the time Of the TNR, the very early and short
emission a few hours is redieted to a ear in the UV to soft X—ra rane called “ﬁreball
pm» Hi dis; —‘n. Hm
110 such signal has yet been Observed due to the difﬁculty in detecting the abrupt short
phenomenon appearing in these energy range.

Monitor 0f All—sky X—ray Image (MAXI; is an all—sky X—ray meni—
ter, Which is operated on the J apanese Experiment Module, the Exposed Facility (J EM—EF)
0n the International S ace Station 188 . MAXI carries two types of X—ray cameras: Gas Slit
Camera GSC' W. and Solid—state Slit Camera (SSC;
ﬂ-; . GSC and SSC have Wide ﬁelds of View (FeVs) of
1.50 X 1600 and 1.50 X 900, respectively, and they scan almost all Of the sky every N 92 min uti—
lizin the attitude rotation coupled With the ISS orbital motion (See Fig. 1 in
1. GSC covers the 2 — 30 keV band using gas proportional counters, While SSC covers
the 0.5 — 12 keV band With the X—ray CCDs. MAXI started its Operation in orbit in 2009
August.

The MAXI transient alert system _-) was triggered on 2011 November
11 at 05:05:59 UT (: T mg) by a new bright soft X—ray source near the Small Magellanic
Cloud (SMC; Fig. l) I. We analyzed the data and reported the source position through
an Astronomer’s Tele_ram (ATEL; _-) and the GRB Coordinates Network
(GUN; _i).

At 0.44 days after Twig, Swift X—ra Teleseoe X-;
-) began follow—up Obserj .) with a tiling mode to cover the
MAXI error Circle (Fig. m; . An uncataloed X—ra source was found
within the MAXI GSC error ellipse (Figmm. Within
the Swift XRT error Circle, a single Optical source is cataloged in USNO—A20, which was also
reported as a source with a near—infrared excess (ID 115 in—-.) The po—
sition is consistent with that Of an otieal counterpart Observed by Swift Ultraviolet/Optieal
Telescope (UVOT; —i), a : 01h59m25sss 6 = —740 15/279”, with an
estimated uncertainty of 0.5 aresee (90% conﬁdence; Fig. '3; —-).

The Swift XRT seetra Obtained after Ttrig + 0.44 d were reported to be similar to the
SSS phase of novae (h) Further follow—up Observations by Swift and ground—
based Optical Observations conﬁrmed that this source is a binar s stem consistin_ Of a WD
and a Be star at the distance of the SMC (d : 60 kpc; h_;
--). _) analyzed the spectrum of the GSC scan at +8 s, using the
on—demand data products provided by the MAXI team, and reported that the luminosity
was N 1.6 X 1039 erg s‘1 in the 2 — 4 keV band; this is one order of magnitude brighter than
the Eddin_t0n luminosity of a solar mass Object. To explain the huge outburst luminosity,
(i) proposed a model of the interaction of the ejected nova shell with the Be
star wind in which the WD is embedded.

Here we present Observations of MAXI J 0158—744 by MAXI, Swift and the Small and
Moderate Aperture Research Telescope System (SMARTS) in Section The analysis and
results of the MAXI GSC and SSC data are described in Sections and with the
detailed spectral analysis for the third scan of MAXI shown in Sections and

MAXI J0158—744 2011 waS ﬁrst detected during a. MAXI GSC Sean
iFii. Iail centered at ng + 8 S within the 55 S triangular transit response (See Fig. 9 in
2011 . It waS subsequently detected twice by the MAXI SSC in scans at
+220 S and +1296 S (Fig. [3.) Hereafter, we designate the MAXI scans by the mid—time 0f
the scan transit, referred to ng. Subsequent GSC scans to date (up to 2013 July 8) have
failed to detect the source. In addition, the source had not been detected in prior GSC scans,
Since MAXI Observations started on 2009 August 14 up to the previous scan at —5530 S.
The MAXI Observations around ng are summarized in Table.

Swift XRT performed follew—up Observations from 0.44 dayS after ng (See Table 1 Of
2012). Swift UVOT also Observed the Optical counterpart in image mode. Swift
UVOT griSm Observations were performed on 2011 November 19 (+8.23 dayS after ng) and
2012 September 30 (324 days).

A ground—based Optical Spectrum, with relatively high resolution, waS obtained on 2012
May 19 (190 dayS after the ng) with the RC Spectrograplvl 0n the SMARTS IiCTIO 1.5m
telescope; thiS iS a long Slit Spectrograph oriented eaSt—weSt 1, 2012 . We
used a 1 aresee Slit width and a Loral 1K CCD for the detector.

0f the anodes #1 and #2 were signiﬁcantly improved from the previous versions (0.x). We
therefore used events taken from all anodes.

To make light curves within the interval of the sean—ID M+0 (Tablel), we followed the
method shown in (-). Here we selected events within 5 mm of the position
coincident with this source along the anode wires, which corresponds to about 20 0n the sky.
The Obtained light—Curve data in energy bands of 2 — 4, 4 — 10, 10 — 20, and 2 — 20 keV were
ﬁtted with a model consisting of a triangular transit response curve for a point source with
a constant ﬂux and a constant background. The light curves are consistent with the model
at the 90% conﬁdence level, meaning that there was no signiﬁcant variation of the source
ﬂux during that scan.

For the spectral analysis, we removed the GSC_8 data due to its poor response in the soft
energy band. We selected a concentric Circle and annulus centered at the target as the source
and background regions, respectively. The radius of the source Circle was set to 1.8 deg. The
inner and outer radii of the background annulus were set to 2.2 and 3.5 deg, respectively. In
both these regions, we excluded a Circular region with a radius of 1.50 centered at a near—by
bright X—ray source, SMC X—l Fi_. . The spectrum and response ﬁles were made by
the method described in_) The energy spectra Obtained by the GSC
Sean—ID M+0 are shown in Fig. (left). We rebirmed the data with a minimum of 1 count
per energy bin and applied Cash statistics in the ﬁt. We used XSPEC V12.7.1 fer
the spectral analysis.

Since the location Of this source is near the SMC, the interstellar absorption by the
total Galactic H 1 column density towards this source, N H, and Optical extinction E (B — V)
are expected to be small. Thus, we decided to ﬁx them for the following X—ray and Optical
spectral analysis. Two plausible different N H values are Obtained from the HEASARC
web site I: 1.36 X 1021 em_2 b usiI1_ LAB ma _-) and 4.03 X 1020
em_2 by using DL map (H. The corresponding Optical extinctions
E (B — V) are derived to be 0.28 and 0.084 ma_ respectively, by using the relation with the
H 1 column densit On the other hand, the map of dust
infrared emission suggests E (B — V) : 0.050, which is
Closer to that from the DL map. Therefore, we decided to use the latter N H value, 4.03 X 1020
ern—2, for the interstellar absorption. In the following, unabsorbed ﬂux is corrected only for
the interstellar absorption.

consistent With all the models. Adopting the N H value of LAB map increases the unabsorbed
ﬂux by 2% from that using DL map. However, the difference in the Spectral parameters and
unabsorbed ﬂux are negligibly small, When they are compared With the statistical uncer—

3.2. Data analysis of MAXI SSC

After the ﬁrst detection of MAXI J 0158—744 with the MAXI GSC scan at +8 s, MAXI
SSC detected this source twice as shown in Table Before +8 s, MAXI J0158—744 was
below the SSC detection limit of ~200 mCrab in each night scan. For the spectral analysis,
we selected the source re_i0I1s as shown in Fig. and reduced the SSC events in the same
way as_ (i) While the second SSC detection at +1296 s was done at night
in the orbit, the ﬁrst SSC at +220 s was done at the day—time. Since the SSC da —time data
were contaminated by the Visible/infrared light from the Sun _i}, we have
to be careful of the analysis Of the +220 s scan data. We estimated the area suffering from
the contamination based on the event distribution, which led to the decision that 63% 0f the
source area was not suitable for the spectral analysis. We thus used data from the remaining
37% area in the analysis.

The energy spectra Obtained by the SSC scans at +220 s and +1296 s are shown in
Fig. (middle, right). In the latter spectrum, since emission lines seemed to be present, we
analyzed the SSC spectra with special care by following the method shown in “low count
spectra” of the XSPEC wiki site I. TO avoid losing information on emission lines due to
the spectral binning, we did not bin the data and applied Cash statistics _-) t0
the ﬁts. We ﬁt the source spectra with a model consisting of a source and a background
component. Here, the background model was analytically—deseribed to approximate the
actual background spectrum in 0.7 — 7.0 keV. It was constructed by averaging the two
year SSC data weighted with geomagnetic eut—Off—rigidity, because the background events
are caused by Charged particles and cosmic diffuse X—rays. The details of the background
spectrum are shown in (I) We ﬁt the seetra b absorbed blackbed ,

we abbreviate it to abund.) El be free or ﬁxed to 0.1 (a typical abundance of the SMC;

As shown in Table. the initial X—ray outburst of MAXI J 0158—744 detected by MAXI
GSC and SSC was peaked at +220 s. The peak luminosity was extraordinarily luminous,
2 x 1040 erg s‘1 in 0.7 — 7.0 keV, which is two orders of magnitude larger than the Eddington
luminosity of a solar Inass object. In the following subsections, we investigate the MAXI SSC
spectrum at +1296 s, where emission lines are apparent, with two scenarios: shook—induoed
emission and photospherio emission at the ﬁreball phase (See Section El).

3.2.]. Detailed spectral analysis of MAX] 350 at +1296 3 with a shock—mduced emission
model

To investigate the emission lines in the spectrum at +1296 s, we ﬁrst ﬁt the spectrum
with models consisting of thermal bremsstrahlung continuum and Gaussian lines, whose
widths were ﬁxed to be small against the detector energy resolution, 85 eV (FWHM) at
1.0 keV _->. The best—ﬁt parameters are summarized in Table (11 er
and the models are shown in Fig. (abod). The results of the likelihood ratio tests
in the last two rows of Table. (upper) indicate that the addition of the Gaussian lines
at the energies E1, E2 and E3 one by one improves the ﬁts with a Chance probability of 0.0044,
0.084 and 0.085, respectively. The line at the energy E1 is the most signiﬁcant, and is inferred
to be a resonance line of He—like neon (0.922 keV). The other two lines are less signiﬁcant
than 20 and no corresponding major lines exist at these energies. However, the line center
energy E2 may suggest a radiative recombination continuum of He—like neon (1.20 keV) or
Lyman beta line of H—like neon (1.24 keV), and the E3 may suggest a resonance line of He—
like aluminum (1.60 keV) or 183]? 1P1 —> 182 130 line of He—like magnesium (1.58 keV). The
neon emission line suggests that the initial bright outburst would have been produced by
an optioally—thin thermal einission mechanism, whose site was a region heated b the shock
wave of a nova exlosion as seen in some novae (RS Ophiuohi and V407 Cyg;

We next tried to ﬁt the spectrum with more physically motivated models. Although it
can be ﬁt with an optioally—thin thermal einission model (Mekal in XSPEC terminology) with
a temperature of N 1.0 keV (Tablel), the model cannot produce the observed strong He—like
neon line. To reproduce the He—like neon, another optioally—thin thermal component with a
lower temperature (about 0.1 keV) is necessary. Thus, we examined a model consisting of
two Mekal models (MekalLT + MekalHT), whose temperatures are N 0.1 keV in the lower
component (LT) and N 1.0 keV in the higher component (HT), respectively. The best—ﬁt
result in Table shows that the abund of the MekalHT is consistent with that of the SMC.

This conclusion, however, is not completely correct, because the ﬁt included an energy range
affected by the He—like neon line produced by the MekalLT component. To determine the
abund 0f MekalHT, we ﬁt the spectrum excluding the energy range 0.8 — 1.0 keV, and then
Obtained an upper limit for the abund of 0.25 (90% conﬁdence limit), which is consistent
with that Of the SMC _->. We thus decided to ﬁx the abund 0f the MekalHT
component to 0.1. For the MekalLT component, the Observed strong He—like neon line suggests
a large abundance fer neon. We postulate that the MekalLT component was produced in a
reverse shocked region whose material was ejeeta from the nova explosion (See Section El).

To estimate the abunds 0f the MekalLT component, we ﬁt the spectrum with the MekalLT
+ MekalHT model assuming six combinations of the abunds 0f neon and the other elements
for MekalLT as shown in Table IZI Here, at the ﬁrst step in the spectral ﬁt, we let the
temperature and emission measure of the MekalHT component freely vary. When the 10
error range of the temperature of the MekalLT was not constrained to less than 0.3 keV in
the ﬁrst step (the ﬁrst three cases of Table El), we ﬁxed the temperature of MekalHT and
then the emission measure of MekalHT t0 the best—ﬁt values. These best ﬁt values were
Obtained by ﬁtting the same spectrum, excluding the energy range 0.8 — 1.0 keV, with a
single Mekal component and the abund ﬁxed to 0.1. For the ﬁrst case Of Table El the 10
error range of the MekalLT could not be constrained to be less than 0.3 keV, even after both
the temperature and emission measure of MekalHT were ﬁxed. Figure (efgh) presents the
difference in these spectral ﬁts with respect to the neon abunds 0f the MekalLT component.
As a result, the neon abund 0f the MekalLT was suggested to be much higher than that Of
the SMC (Table El), and it indicates that the MekalLT component originates in ejeeta from
the nova. The unabsorbed ﬂux in 0.7 — 7.0 keV, assuming the MekalLT + MekalHT model
with parameters shown in the ﬁfth row of Table IZI (the best—ﬁt model), is 1.631181%? x 10—8

3.22 Detailed spectral analysis of MAX] 350 at +1296 3 with photosphem'c emission at

the ﬁreball phase

The initial bright outburst detected by MAXI may also be explained by photospherie
emission at the ignition phase of a nova explosion, the so—Called ﬁreball phase (See See—
tien ED. In this scenario, the main continuum component in the spectrum of MAXI SSC at
+1296 s is blackbody emission, while the emission lines come from the Optically—thin region
surrounding the photesphere (See Fig. .in Seetienl). Thus, we ﬁt the spectrum with mod—
els consisting of blackbody continuum and Gaussian lines. The results of the ﬁt are shown
in Tablel(10wer). The addition of the Gaussian line at the energy E1 signiﬁcantly improves

the ﬁts with a Chance probability of 1.9 X 10—4, while the other two lines are detected at
< 20. The identiﬁcations Of these lines are the same as in Section The detection of
the neon emission line suggests that the spectrum contains an OpticaIIy—thin thermal emis—
sion component. Therefore, this spectrum could be explained by a composite model of a
blackbody and a Mekal with a temperature below 0.3 keV, and an exceptionally large neon
abundance, similar to the two Mekal models in Section When the abunds 0f neon
and the other elements are set to 10 and 0.1, respectively, the resultant best—ﬁt spectral
parameters are as follows: the temperature and emission measure of the Mekal component
are 0.14(0.0808 — 0.28) keV (See footnotes h, j and l of Table.) and 1.13f?_20§7 x 1063 CID—3,
respectively. The temperature and radius of the blackbody component are 0.391188:l keV and

3.3. Upper limits on other MAXI GSC scans

In the scans at —5530 s and +5545 s (Tablel), MAXI J0158—744 was not detected by
MAXI GSC. To calculate the upper limits on these ﬂuxes, we assumed the best—ﬁt MekaILT +
MekaIHT model Obtained by the MAXI SSC scan at +1296 s (Section-) and the best—ﬁt
blackbody model (the Sean—ID M+1 in Table I). In the former model, the abund 0f the
MekaIHT and the MekaILT was ﬁxed to 0.1 except for the neon abund in the MekaILT ﬁxed to
10 (TabIeIZI, the ﬁfth row). The 90% conﬁdence—Ievel upper limits on the unabsorbed ﬂux in
0.7 — 7.0 keV for these scans are < 1.94 x 10—9 and < 8.29 X 10—10 erg s‘1 ern‘2 in the two
Mekal model, and < 2.75 X 10—9 and < 9.60 X 10—10 erg s‘1 ern‘2 in the blackbody model.

In addition, in all ﬁve scans between the scan at +5545 s (+0064 d) and the start of
the Swift XRT follew—up (i.e. at +0128, +0.192, +0256, +0.320, and +0385 days), MAXI
J0158—744 was not detected by MAXI GSC. The 90% conﬁdence—Ievel upper limit on the
unabsorbed ﬂux in the 0.7—7.0 keV band for this period was 3.5 X 10—10 erg s‘1 CIIl_2,
assuming the former model and 2.5 X 10—10 erg s‘1 ern‘2 for the latter model.

We analyzed the same Swift XRT archival data as listed in Table 1 0f (-),
using Swift software version 3.9, released as part Of HEASOFT 6.12. We extracted the source
events from a Circle with Optimal radii (47” — 23”) and the background from an Offset Circular
region of radius 142”. For the data on day 0.54, we excluded events from the inner 5” 0f

the PSF to avoid pile—up. In the spectral ﬁt, we used the RMFs (Redistribution Matrix
Files) of swxp00t012s6_20010101V013.rmf in PC mode and swxwt0t02s6_20010101V014.rmf
in WT mode. The ARFs (Ancillary Response Files) were generated by using the commands
xrteXpomap (to create the exposure maps) and xrtmkarf.

We ﬁt the Swift XRT spectra with absorbed blackbody 0r Mekal models with the in—
trinsic column N H allowed to vary. These models include two absorption components: the
interstellar absorption N H ﬁxed at 4.03 X 1020 em_2 (Section and intrinsic abs0rti0r1.
In the Mekal model, the abund was ﬁxed to 0.1, a typical abund 0f the SMC
-, See also Section -). The unabsorbed ﬁuX Obtained by the blackbody ﬁts are shown
in FigureIZI

We also analyzed the Swift UVOT data Obtained at the same time as Swzﬁ XRT, using
the Swift software version 3.9, released as part Of HEASOFT 6.12. The image data of each
ﬁlter, from each Observation sequence, i.e., with a given Observation ID, were summed using
uvotimsum. However, for images taken within 2 days Of the outburst (b, u and 2111 bands)
individual exposures were long enough that summing was not necessary. Photometry 0f the
source in individual sequences was derived Via uvotmaghist, using an extraction region of
radius 5” and a suitable background region. Magnitudes are based on the UVOT photometric
system -). XSPEC compatible spectral ﬁles for the source were created using
the same region with uvot2pha.

The u band light curve is shown in FigureIZl We calculated the absolute magnitude of
the enhanced emission after extinction correction where E B — V : 0.050 mag (Section
1, AV/E(B_V) : 31,1, 2 1.6641. #1,...de SMC

(13.58 mag, average of u—band magnitudes from 11.65 days to 27.86 days). By ﬁtting it with
a linear function, we Obtained the absolute magnitude of —5.04 :l: 0.07 mag at 0.44 day and

--), assuming that the Optical enhancement was due to the photospherie emission
as in usual novae.

To investigate the Optical enhanced emission, we made a difference spectrum from the
Swift UVOT photometry over the six ﬁlter bandpassesl between day 1.5 and 149, and we
ﬁt it with a blackbody model with ﬁxed interstellar extinction (Section -). The blackbody
temperature of 1.221582%J x 104 K and the radius of 6.58:1,jg3 x 1011 cm were Obtained at

a temperature of 2.341828?l x 104 K and a radius of 5.81183 x 1011 em. The extrapolation
of the best—ﬁt blackbody spectrum towards the UV re_i0n is consistent with the UV ﬁuX
Obtained by Galax Evolution Explorer (GALEX' 2005) during the pre—
eutburst phase 2012). In addition, 2012 reported that the l—band ﬁuX
returned to the pre—outburst level N 60 days after T trig. SO, we can assume that the ﬂux at
day 149 contains only emission from the binary companion star. The Obtained temperature
and radius are consistent with those of a B—type star, as shown in 2012 .

Swift UVOT grisrn spectra are Close to that Of an earl B—t e star. No clear emission
lines can be identiﬁed above the noise, as shown ind 2012 .

3.4.2. Ground—based optical spectroscopy by SMARTS

We Obtained three 200—s spectra of the Optical counterpart of MAXI J 0158—744 in order
to ﬁlter for cosmic rays. We combine the three images, and extract the spectrum by ﬁtting
a Gaussian in the spatial direction at each pixel. Wavelength calibration is accomplished
by ﬁtting a 3rd to 6th order polynomial t0 the calibration lamp line positions. The Optical
spectrum covers nearly the entire Optical band (3300 — 950021) at 1721 resolution.

There are Clear emission lines of Ha and H 5, with equivalent widths of 16 1:1 and 1 121,
respectively. We could not ﬁnd any other signiﬁcant emission 0r absortion lines above the
noise level. The SMARTS spectrum matches the NTT spectrum of 2012), albeit
with worse signal to noise.

3.5. Historical X-ray ﬂuxes

To investigate the activity of MAXI J0158—744 before the discovery, we searched for
previous X—ray Observations of the area including the target position. This region was ob—
served by the ROSAT all—sky survey, XMM—Newton slew survey and MAXI GSC. The source
was undetected in all these Observations. We calculated the upper limits on the unabsorbed
ﬂuxes in an energy range of 0.7 — 7.0 keV, assuming the best—ﬁt MekalLT + MekalHT model
(Table the ﬁfth row; Outburst Model) and a typical spectrum in the SSS phase Observed
b Swift XRT, an absorbed blackbody with a temperature of 0.1 keV (SSS Model;
2012 .

The ROSAT All—Sky Survey covered this ﬁeld, with an exposure of 775 s in total between
1990 September 22 and December 3. These data provide a PSPC count rate upper limit of

"
"22","_ 22 _
0.14 counts s‘1 (90% conﬁdence limit) over 0.1 — 2.5 keV; corresponding to < 2.1 x 10—13
and < 6.5 X 10—14 ergs CID—2 s‘1 (0.7 — 7.0 keV), assuming Outburst Model and SSS Model,
respectively (Tablel).

XMM—Newton slewed over the source three times on 2006 November, 2007 October, and
2009 November. We Obtained EPIC pn count rate upper limits of 0.35, 1.5 and 0.50 counts
s‘1 (20 level) in 0.2 — 12 keV, respectively. The corresponding unabsorbed ﬂuxes (0.7 — 7.0
keV) are shown in Table

We also analyzed the MAXI GSC image in the 4—10 keV band integrated for 7 months
from 2009 Setember 1 to 2010 March 31. Applying the same analysis procedure as used
by (-), we Obtain a 90% conﬁdenee—level upper limit of 0.10 mCrab. It
corresponds to an unabsorbed ﬂux of < 1.8 X 10—11 ergs CID—2 s‘1 (0.7 — 7.0 keV), assuming
Outburst Model.

4. Discussion

The X—ray transient MAXI J0158—744 is Characterized by (1) a soft X—ray spectrum
With most of the X—ray photons being detected below 4 keV (Fig. and Fig. I), (2) a
short duration (between 752 — t1 : 1.3 X 103 s and t3 — t_1 : 1.10 X 104 s; Table I), (3)
a very rapid rise time (< 151 — t_1 : 5.5 X 103 s; Table I), and (4) a huge peak lumi—
nosity 0f 2 x 1040 erg s‘1 in the 0.7 — 7.0 keV band recorded at the second MAXI scan.
The unusually soft spectrum of the outburst is beyond astronomers’ expectations, because
most short—lived luminous transient X—ray sources are hard X—ra emitters e._. Gamma—ray
Bursts Soft Gamma Repeaters Suer—giant
Fast X—ray Transients _-), and X—ray bursts . The
discovery of MAXI J0158—744, together With supernova shock breakouts
-), suggests that the Wide—ﬁeld monitoring experiments in soft X—rays (< 2 keV) Will
Open new discovery ﬁelds.

_) reported the Optical spectra Obtained by SAAO and ESQ, showing that
the source is a Be star. In addition, they showed that the radial velocity of this source is
consistent With the SMC, Which strongly supports that this source is located in the SMC.
Due to the similarity between the Swift X—ray spectra and the SSS phase of novae, they
concluded that this source is a binary system consisting of a WD and a Be star. We also
analyzed the SED 0f the Optical counterpart and found that it is consistent With that Of a
B—type star. The Optical spectrum taken b SMARTS showed Clear emission lines of H a and

We ﬁt the Swift XRT spectra with absorbed blackbody 0r Mekal models. Neither model
was strongly preferred from the statistics. However, the evolution of the temperature of the
Mekal model shows an unexplained decrease at 3—7 days, while the temperature and radius
of the blackbody ﬁts can be understood as being due to the shrinking photosphere. Here,
the radius decreased from N 104 kin to N 100 km, while the temperature increased from
N 0.06 keV to N 0.1 keV. Therefore, we conclude that the spectra were basically blackbedy—
like, and hence can be identiﬁed as a super—seft X—ray phase of a nova. This conclusion is the
same as- (-). Fits using WD atmosphere models _-;
would allow further insights, although a trial with the Tiibingen WD model failed to
improve the ﬁts, due to the computational upper limit for the temperature (--).
Probabl , more sophisticated spectral models like atmosphere models would improve the ﬁts.
reported that adding a broad emission line at N0.7 keV and an absorption
edge at 0.89 keV improves the ﬁt for the spectrum at 1.54 d signiﬁcantly, which also supports
our interpretation that the early X—ray emission is due to the SSS phase of novae.

The SSS phase spectra from the ﬁrst Swift XRT fellew—up Observation at 0.44 d and the
simultaneous Optical enhanced emission Obtained by Swift UVOT are unusual in the evolu—
tion of standard novae. Nonetheless, if the Optical enhanced emission is the photospherie
emission of nova ejeeta as in standard novae, the speed Class indicator araineter 0f td72
means that it is the second fastest nova next to U See 1.2 days; and
an equal record to V838 Her (2 days; - The peak absolute magnitude
(—5.04 :l: 0.07) at 0.44 day in the ﬁrst Swift UVOT Observation is four magnitudes fainter
than those of typical novae (—9016 i 0.008 exeeted from the MMRD (maximum magni—
tude — rate of decline) relation ﬂ-) If this enhanced Optical emission
was photospherie emission from the nova ejeeta, it suggests a low ejeeta mass in this nova
explosion. In the subsequent discussion below, we will show that the enhanced Optical emis—
sion is not photospherie emission, however, the conclusion of the low ejeeta Inass remains
correct.

4.1. Shock heating mechanism

Optically—thin thermal X—ray emission of novae is usually explained by a shock heating
mechanism at a blast wave produced by the nova explosion. The recurrent nova, RS Ophi—
uChi, in 2006 exhibited the most luminous Optically—thin thermal X—ra emission (1 X 1036
erg s_l) among novae that has ever been Observed _i}. The lumines—
ity of the X—ray outburst of MAXI J0158—744 was, surprisingly, four orders of magnitude
larger than this. explained the luminosity of MAXI J 0158—744 by the shock

heating mechanism, however, their explanation has difﬁculties as follows. They tried to eX—
plain the Observed luminosity of N 1039 e1r_s_1 at the time Of the ﬁrst GSC scan (sean—ID
M+0; Table using Equation (1) 0f (-), where the radius of the shock wave
7‘8 N 1.5 X 1013 cm is assumed. However, in order for the shock wave to expand to this radius
within At,» : t1 — t_1 : 5.5 X 103 s (Tablel), the shock wave velocity must be exceptionally
large (V8 : rs/Atr N 3 X 104 km s_l) fer nevae. In addition, if the velocity of the shock
wave was such a large value, the temperature of the plasma thermalized by the shock wave
becomes very high ( kT : W N 1 MeV, where mp is the proton mass, and ,u is the mean
molecular weight I), which is contradictory to the Observed soft spectrum of the outburst
(kT N 1 keV).

We further discuss the shock heating scenario, considering the very rapid rise time within
At,» s and the Observed low temperature (0.97 keV; Tablel). We set the onset time Of the nova
explosion to between the last scan time Of the sean—ID M—1 (t_l; Table and the ﬁrst scan
time Of the sean—ID M+0 (t1; Tablel). The elapsed time from t0 t0 151 is 15871 : t1 —to < At,» s.
We check whether the Observed emission measure (EM E f nenpdV : 1.0 X 1063 EM63 (£602
CIIl_3, where EM63 : 2.4 for the Mekal model ﬁt with free abund in Table and aim 2 1;

produced at 759,1 by considering two simple geometries, a ﬁlled sphere and spherical shell.
Here, we assume the Circumbinary space is ﬁlled with a fully—ionized electren—ien plasma.
with a constant density. We assume the constant shock velocity V8, and then the distance
(R1) of the shock wave front reaching from the surface of the WD at the time 15871 is

R1 : 759,1 x V, < At, x V, : 5.5 x 10111433 cm, (1)
where V8 : 1031/83 km s‘1 (V83 2 1).

If the shape of the emission region is a ﬁlled sphere, the emission measure at 15871 is written
as EM : §7TR13np’ne’ : §7TR13fa1np’2 (hereafter, we add “ ’ ” for the physical value after
the shock). Since we assume that the initial X—ray outburst is an Optically—thin emission,
the condition of the Optical depth is 716’ 0TR1 : falnp’ 0TR1 < 1, where GT is the Thomson
cross section. By removing np’, we Obtain R1 > %O%fa1 = 1.1 x 1014fa1EM63d602 em.
Therefore, it is impossible to reduce the Observed emission measure at 151 in the usual shock
velocity (V83 N 1 — 10; —-; --), even at the speed of light.

Next, if the shape of the emission region is a spherical shell with a depth of 6R1, the
emission measure at 759,1 is written as EM : 47719126191711] ne’ . The condition of the Optical
depth is n6/0T6R1 : falnp/OT6R1 < 1. By removing np’, we Obtain R1 > %0%%fa1 :

that in the stellar wind and even that in a Circumstellar equatorial disk around a Be star,
typically f, 1013 CIIl_3 Waters et a1. 1). Therefore, we conclude that the shock heating
scenario cannot explain the soft X—ray outburst Observed by MAXI.
4.2. Thermonuclear runaways at the ignition phase

We thus instead propose another scenario to explain this outburst b invekin_ an ex—
traordinary massive WD. A more massive WD has a smaller radius 1972), and
thus a higher surface gravity leading to a higher pressure in the accumulated mass. The

"
"27","_ 27 _

nova explosion on a massive WD is triggered by less fuel, and thus it results in a short nova
duration. The observed SSS phase of MAXI J 0158—744 started much earlier < 0.44 da s
and lasted a much shorter time N one month) than other fast novae
_- -%he earliest turn—on of a SSS phase observed so far was
10 days in U Soo and 11i5 days in one of 60 novae in M31
->. The extremely early SSS hase of MAXI J 0158—744 is unexpected in models of novae
on typical solar Inass WDs (—-). It suggests an unusually low ejeota mass
in the nova explosion, and thus unusually massive white dwarf near the Chandrasekhar Inass.
It Ini_ht even su_est a suer—Chandrasekhar Inass. Indeed, according to theoretical models
(—h; —->, WDs can acquire super—Chandrasekhar Inasses
up to 2.3 — 2.7MQ, if they rotate differentially.

With this new perspective, we propose to interpret the initial super—Eddin_ton X—ra
outburst as an i nition hase of a nova 'ust after the TNR, a ﬁreball phase
-; —i; -_Jbl) In this process, the thermal energy produced
by the TNR is conveyed by the convection and released outside the envelope with a timescale
of N 100 s, Characterized by the haIf—Iives of unstable nuclei (Fig. I). In novae on a white
dwarf with a usual Inass, transient soft X—ray emission < 0.1 keV for N 100 — 1000 s
just after the TNR is theoretically expected (m, but that has
not been observed et. It is expected to reach about 10 times the Eddington luminosity
(—-). For a very massive WD, we speculate that the TNR would
produce more luminous X—ray emission with higher temperature due to a smaller amount of
the envelope at the ignition phase of a nova.

In this scenario, bIaokbody—Iike X—ray emission is expected at the ignition phase. In the
spectral analysis (Tablel), we obtained the radius of the photosphere to be rph N 103751178 kin
(Tph78 2 1). The rate of mass ejection (M ) can be estimated from this radius as follows. From
the continuity equation for the distribution of ejeota around the WD, 47Tr2pVe : M , where
M is a rate of mass ejection from the WD and constant in the radial distance (7“), and
p : Z Am-aZ-mpnp : Aﬂmpnp is mass density, the number density of protons is written by

On the other hand, the reaction rate of mass producing nuclear energy (M f) is related
to the Observed luminosity (LX) by 77Mf02 > LX, where 77 : 0.007 and LX : 1040 erg
s‘1 (Tablel). Then, Mf > LX/7702 : 2 x 1021 g s_l. Therefore, the relation Mf >> M
is Obtained, which means that energy produced by the TNR at the bottom of accreted
layer can escape as an X—ray photons efﬁciently with very small mass ejection, despite the
super—Eddington luminosity.

Thus, there must be some sort of mechanism to realize the super—Eddin_t0n luminosit
with a small mass e'eetion. We infer a convection just after the TNR
-; for that mechanism, then we expect that future theoretical works
of the TNR process, applied to the mass range near or over the Chandrasekhar limit, will Clar—
if this mechanism. We also suspect that photon bubbles in hihl Ina_netized atmospheres
may work to solve this problem. According to“ (-), to produce
the N 100 Eddington luminosity with small mass ejection, the magnetic pressure Pmag must
be N 100 times larger than the gas pressure Pgas. On the other hand, the gas pressure at the
bottom of an accreted _as la er at an i_niti0n Of a nova is expected to be Pgas N 1020 dyne
ern‘2 d_; h). Then the magnetic ﬁeld (B) necessary
for the N 100 Eddington luminosity is B : (87TPmag)1/2 N (8W100Pgas)1/2 N 5 X 1011 G.
Interestingly, such highly Ina_netized WDs with suer—Chandrasekhar Inasses (2.3 — 2.6MQ)
are predicted theoretically (—i)

Since the TNR process is expected to last for N 100 s at the bottom of the accreted
Inass layer on the surface of WDs _ —->, the
rate of mass ejection probably peaked between the scans at +220 s and +1296 s. It means
that MAXI scans at +8 s and +220 s Observed the photospherie expansion phase (B —> C
in Fig. 1 0--), while the MAXI scan at +1296 s Observed the shrinking
phase (C —> D in the same ﬁgure). The strong neon emission line at +1296 s suggests that
there was an Optically—thin thermal emission region surrounding the photesphere and ﬁlled
with ejeeta dredged—up from a massive O—Ne WD. Such ejeeta may have been provided by the
previous photospherie expansion. It must be noted that the existing models of the TNR do
not predict this surrounding emission line region. This Observation provides us new physical
details.

In this scenario, the Optical enhancement Observed by Swift UVOT is no longer the usual
photospherie emission of nova ejeeta. Since the Optical decay seeins correlated with the decay
of SSS X—ray emission (Fig. middle and bottom), it can be explained by the reprocessed
emission from the X—ray irradiated Circumstellar disk of the Be star. It is justiﬁed by the
fact that the size of the otieal enhanced emission (6.6 X 1011 em; Section-) is comparable
to the disk scale height _-)

5. Summary

Monitor 0f All—sky X—ray Image (MAXI) discovered an extraordinarily luminous soft X—
ray transient, MAXI J 0158—744, near the Small Magellanic Cloud (SMC) on 2011 November
11. This source is a binary system consisting of a white dwarf (WD) and a Be star at the
distance of the SMC. MAXI detected it in three scans at +8 s, +220 s and +1296 s after the
trigger time. The X—ray luminosity peaked 0n the second scan at 2 X 1040 erg s‘1 (0.7 — 7.0
keV), which is two orders of magnitude brighter than the Eddington luminosity of a solar
Inass Object. The spectrum of the third scan showed a He—like neon emission, suggesting
that the emission contains an Optically—thin thermal component and the WD is a massive
O—Ne WD. While the X—ray outburst could be considered as a kind of nova 0n the basis of
the luminosity and the spectral evolutions, the huge peak luminosity and the rapid rise time
(< 5.5 X 103 s) are difﬁcult to explain by shOCk—indueed emission, accepted for Optically—
thin thermal emission in nova explosions observed so far. Instead, we propose the scenario
that the X—ray outburst is the direct manifestation of the thermonuclear runaway process
at the onset of the nova explosion, the so—Called ﬁreball phase. The super—Eddington X—ray
outburst and the subsequent very early super—soft source phase indicate a small ejeeta Inass,
implying the underlying WD is unusually massive near the Chandrasekhar limit, or possibly
exceeding the limit.
