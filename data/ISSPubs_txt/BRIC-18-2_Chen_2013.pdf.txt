5 Abstract
2, The unfolded protein response (UPR) is fundamental for development and adaption in eukaryotic
2‘ cells. Arabidopsis has become one of the best model systems to uncover conserved mechanisms of
the UPR in multicellular eukaryotes as well as organism-speciﬁc regulation of the UPR in plants.
Monitoring the UPR in planta is an elemental approach to identifying regulatory components and
to revealing molecular mechanisms of the plant UPR. In this chapter, we provide protocols for the
induction and analyses of plant UPR at a molecular level in Arabidopsis. Three kinds of ER stress
Z treatment methods and quantitation of the plant UPR activation are described here.

2 1 Introduction
3 The unfolded protein response (UPR) is a collection of signaling pathways aiming to
'2 maintain endoplasmic reticulum (ER) protein folding homeostasis in eukaryotic cells [1, 2].
There is approximately 0ne-third 0ft0ta1 protein folded and modiﬁed in the ER.
Environmental or physiological factors that cause an imbalance between demand and
capability of ER protein folding lead to ER stress. To relieve the ER stress, increase in the
ER protein folding ability is one of the most instant and central regulation in the UPR.
Diverse stimuli from exogenous 0r endogenous signals trigger the activation of the UPR. To
Z experimentally examine the UPR, chemicals disturbing the ER protein folding homeostasis
II are applied to induce the UPR. One of the most frequently used UPR inducers is a
; glycosylation inhibitor, tunicamycin (Tm). The majority of secretory proteins are
E glycosylated in the ER as the glycosylation is crucial for protein structure formation and for
5-"" protein targeting to cellular compartments. As Tm blocks the ﬁrst step of N-linked
9: glycosylation, it can efﬁciently lead to accumulation of unfolded protein in the ER lumen
“Z, and therefore activate the UPR [3 — 6].
:5
(53 To observe the plant UPR at different growth stages, we describe three experimental
€- approaches to perform ER stress treatment. To investigate long-term ER stress tolerance,
"""" seeds are directly germinated on medium containing a relatively low concentration of Tm.
Tm can also been inﬁltrated into leaves to monitor the UPR speciﬁcally on ground tissues.

Finally, to examine the early outputs of the plant UPR, a short-term Tm treatment using a
liquid method is conducted to observe a more instant and direct response to ER stress.
Z
E To cope With dynamic ER protein folding demands, the UPR adjusts the transcription of
JD genes function in assembling protein structure, degrading mis-folded protein, and
> determining cell fates [7, 8]. Hence, the upregulation of well-established UPR tar et enes,

phenotypes, the growth of Tm-treated seedlings should be observed every day during the assay.
