Abstract
We present the ﬁrst results on the black hole candidate XTE J1752—223 from
the Gas Slit Camera (GSC) on—board the Monitor 0f All—sky X—ray Image (MAXI)
0n the International Space Station. Including the onset of the outburst reported by
the Proportional Counter Array en—board the Rossi X—ray Timing Explorer on 2009
October 23, the MAXI/GSC has been monitoring this source approximately 10 times
per day with a high sensitivity in the 2—20 keV band. XTE J1752—223 was initially
in the lew/hard state during the ﬁrst 3 months. An anti—eorrelated behavior between
the 2—4 keV and 4—20 keV bands were Observed around J anuary 20, 2010, indicating
that the source exhibited the spectral transition to the high/seft state. A transient
radio jet may have been ejected when the source was in the intermediate state where
the spectrum was roughly explained by a power—law with a photon index of 2.5—3.0.
The unusually long period in the initial lew/hard state implies a slow variation in
the mass accretion rate, and the dramatic soft X—ray increase may be explained by a
sudden appearance of the accretion disk component with a relatively low innermost
temperature (0.4—0.7 keV). Such a low temperature might suggest that the maximum
accretion rate was just above the critical gas evaporation rate required for the state
transition.
Key words: accretion disks — black hole physics — stars: individual (XTE
J1752—223) — X—rays: stars
1. Introduction
Galactic Black hole candidates (BHCs) are ideal Objects in studying how accretion disks
and coronae evolve due to Changes in the accretion rate, thanks to their high photon statistics
and frequent state transitions (see, e.g., McClintOCk 85 Remillard (2006) for a review). They are
Characterized by transient behavior, such as a sudden X—ray brightening caused by instabilities
originating in the outer accretion disk. During the outburst, which typically lasts a few months,
they may go through several distinct spectral states, initial 10w / hard state (LHS), intermediate
or very high state (IMS/VHS), high/seft state (HSS), LHS, then go back to quiescence. These
states are believed to reﬂect Changes in the geometry of the accretion disk and corona (Esin,
McClintOCk, 85 Narayan 1997), as well as jet (Markoff et a1. 2001, Yuan, Cui, 85 Narayari
2005). BHCs sometimes shew powerful radio jets in their outbursts in association with state
transitions from the LHS t0 the HSS. Hence, study Of the spectral transition and the disk—jet
interaction is important in Clarifying jet production mechanisms (see, e.g., Fender (2006) for a
review).

"3","The new X—ray transient XTE J1752—223 was ﬁrst detected at the 30 InCrab ﬂux level
in the 2—10 keV range on October 23, 2009 during the galactic bulge monitoring with the
Proportional Counter Array (PCA) 0f the Rossi X—ray Timing Explorer (RXTE) Markwardt
et al. 2009a. On October 24, the source also triggered the Swift Burst Alert Telescope (BAT)
at a 100 InCrab ﬂux in the 15—50 keV range (Markwardt et al. 2009a). The position was
determined to (RA,D€C):(17h52mI5S.I4, —22O20’33”.8) with 5 arC—see uncertainty by a follow—
up Swift X—Ray Telescope (XRT) localization (Markwardt et al. 2009b). The energy spectrum
is consistent with a power—Iaw with photon index 1.38i0.01 and the power spectrum shows
band—Iiinited noise with a total rins of ~30 percent, suggesting that the source was in a typical
LHS (Shaposhnikov et a1. 2009; MunOZ—Darias et a1. 2010). The Optical (Torres et al. 2009a),
near—infrared (Torres et al. 2009b), and radio counterparts (Brocksopp et a1. 2009) were also
discovered within the X—ray error Circle during the initial phase. Possible doubIe—sided jets were
detected on February 11, 2010 (Brocksopp et al. 2010a; Brocksopp et al. 2010b); however, the
BH inass, inclination angle, and distance have not been determined yet.

Since August 3, 2009, the highly sensitive aII—sky monitor, Monitor 0f AII—sky X—ray
Image, MAXI(I\/Iatsu0ka et a1. 2009), has been activated on the Exposed Facility 0f the J apanese
Experimental Module “Kibo” 0f the International Space Station (ISS). Soon after the discovery
of XTE J 1752—223, when the MAXI was still in the commissioning phase, the source was found
at the 30 InCrab level in an X—ray image of the MAXI Gas Slit Camera (GSC) (Nakahira et
a1. 2009). MAXI/GSC also Observed a rapid spectral softening on 2010 January 22 due to a
spectral transition from the LHS t0 the HSS (Negoro et a1. 2010). The MAXI initial results
are described in Matsuoka et a1. (2010) and UenO et a1. (2010).

In this paper, we report on MAXI GSC Observations of XTE J1752—223 during its
outburst since October 2009. In the Observation and result section, we demonstrate MAXI’s
spectral performance for such a bright source. Finally, we discuss the origin of the rather
unusual behavior of XTE J1752—223 in the light curve and spectral hardness.

2. Observations and Results

The MAXI carries two scientiﬁc instruments: the GSC and the Solid State Camera
(SSC). The GSC consists of twelve one—diinensional position—sensitive proportional counters
Operated in the 2—20 keV range, while the SSC is composed of 32 X—ray CCD cameras with an
energy range of 05—12 keV. The GSC Observes two different directions (horizontal and zenithal
direction) with an instantaneous ﬁeld of View Of 30 X 1600 each covered by six cameras. It covers
70 percent of the whole sky in every orbit 32 times per day at maximum. Both instruments
have been working properly in orbit, but four out Of the twelve GSC cameras are turned Off due
to discharges in the proportional counters. See Matsuoka et a1. (2009) for more details of the
MAXI. In this paper, we use only the GSC data, which Offer a larger sky coverage and effective
area than those of the SSC.

centered on XTE J1752—223 in the 2—20 keV band. These false—oolor images are produced by
superposing red (2—4 keV), green (4—10 keV), and blue (10—20 keV) images. Data from all the
counters were combined, and two images were made for two separate periods (from December
20, 2009 to January 19, 2010, and January 20, 2010 to February 28, 2010). XTE J1752—223
is Clearly detected in both GSC images. Because of its location near the Galactic Center (1,
b):(6.42, 2.11), many bright X—ray sources such as GX 9+1, GX 5—1, and GK 3+1 are Visible
in this ﬁeld. The point spread function (PSF) of the MAXI/GSC is estimated at about 2.0
degrees (FWHM) in this energy range. The position of XTE J1752—223 determined by the
GSC was consistent with the Swift/XRT localization.

We calculated net souroe counts by subtracting the background from the or1—souroe data.
To avoid the source contamination from the nearby bright souroes GX 9+1 (2.82O away) and
SAX J1748.9—2021 in the globular Cluster NGC 6440 (Patrurio et a1. 2010; 2.130 away), we
carefully selected the source and background regions as Circles of 1.17—degree arid 2.48—degree
radius, respectively (see Figure 1). The extracted souroe counts were normalized by dividing
by a total exposure (in unit of om2s) obtained with a time integral of the collimator effective
area. The Crab Nebula was analyzed in the same way, and the count rates of XTEJ 1752—223
were normallized by the Crab unit (1.30, 1.25, and 0.32 counts om—2 s‘1 in the 2—4, 4—10, and
10—20 keV range). The 1—day averaged light curve of XTE J1752—223 thus obtained is shown
in Figure 2. The GSC scans were performed approximately 10 times per day. A data gap from
December 7th to 23th was due to solar avoidance limitation (the current solar protection is set
at above 40 from the Sun).

The X—ray light curve shows the following notable features. There are two initial plateau
phases that lasted for ~25 days and ~40 days, respectively, and the spectral hardness between
them is slightly different: the second phase (Phase D in Figure 2) has a softer spectrum than
the ﬁrst one (Phase B). The source could not be observed during phase D by any other X—ray
instruments except for RXTE/ASM arid Swift/BAT due to the Sun constraints. The time scales
of the rising phases A and C were about 5 days and 15 days, respectively. Another notable
feature is the anti—oorrelated behavior around the peak: The 2—4 keV ﬂux rapidly increased
after January 20, 2010 (MJD: 55216) while ﬂuxes in the other two bands and the Swift/BAT
15—50 keV ﬂux decreased (Phase E for N 9 days). The anti—oorrelation between the soft and
hard bands indicates a spectral transition. This fact means that it took a very long time of N
90 days for the source to complete the transition after the onset of outburst. The 2—20 keV
ﬂux reached a peak on January 23, 2010 (MJD: 55219) at about the 430 mCrab level, then
gradually decreased (Phase F). The emissions during Phase F are dominated by the soft bands
(< 4 keV) (see also the lower panel of Figure 1). Around March 28 (MJD: 55283), hard X—rays
and the hardness ratio again increase (Phase G and H). The outburst continues at the time of
writing this paper (the end of May 2010), and the current duration for the outburst is about

4

"
"5","210 days.

Figure 3 shows a hardness—intensity diagram for the currently en—going outburst in XTE
J1752—223. Because Of the anti—Correlated behavior between the soft and hard X—rays during
Phases E and G, the data points track the Q—shaped curve, i.e. hysteresis behavior, as seen in
other BHCs (Homan & Belleni 2005). The two plateau phases B and D correspond to the LHS,
while the softer phase F corresponds with the HSS. Thus, the state transition from the LHS
t0 the HSS can be Clearly identiﬁed with the MAXI/GSC data alone. A celer—Celer diagram is
also shown in Figure 4. A line is plotted for a power—law spectral model with a photon index
(F) ranging from 1.0 to 5.0 modiﬁed by the absorption (equivalent hydrogen column density
NH:0.72X1022CIII_2; Munez—Darias et a1. 2010). Note that the current GSC energy response
gives systematic uncertainties of about 0.5><1022 CIIl_2 and 0.1 in NH and F, respectively.
As the outburst proceeds, the F continuously varies from ~15 to ~50. The spectral shape
during Phases B+D and F are is approximated by a power—law with photon indices of 1.5—
2.0 and above 3.5, respectively. These estimated photon indices are roughly consistent with
typical values found from BHCs in the LHS (Phase B+D) and the HSS (Phase F). The power—
law index in Phase E shows an intermediate value (2.0—3.0) between these seen in the LHS
and the HSS. An RXTE—peinted Observation carried out on January 19, 2010 (MJD: 55215)
during Phase E shows that the source was at least in the IMS (Shapeshnikev 2010). Detailed
spectral parameters and their evolution in this outburst will be reported in a forthcoming paper
(Yamaeka et a1. 2010, in preparation).

3. Discussions

We have presented the ﬁrst results on the black hole candidate XTE J1752—223 in the
current outburst from the MAXI/GSC 0n the ISS. Judging from the light curve and spectral
hardness, we have found that the source was initially in the LHS with two long plateau phases
(B and D). After the long stay (~90 days) in the LHS, it exhibited a spectral transition Via
the IMS (Phase E) into the HSS around January 22, 2010 (Phase F). The source came back to
the LHS around April 3, 2010 (Phase H), and the source ﬂux is gradually declining toward the
quiescent state.

It should be noted that a relatively high level of radio emission was detected by the
Australia Telescope Compact Array (ATCA) on January 21, 2010 (Broeksopp et al. 2010a),
just corresponding to the beginning of the spectral transition from the LHS t0 the HSS. The
GSC spectrum on this date is roughly represented by a power—law with a photon index of 2.5—
3.0 (see Figure 4), suggesting that the source was probably in the IMS. Later, two separate
radio sources were identiﬁed with high resolution imaging by the European VLBI Network
(e—EVN) (Breeksepp et al. 2010b). If we interpret it as plasma ejection, it is consistent with
the scenario that large—seale jets are produced in association with the spectral transition from
the LHS t0 the HSS. Another important result is that the luminosities during the transition

5

"
"6","from the HSS to the LHS, and from the LHS to the HSS were not the same: the hard—to—
soft transition happened at a 2—20 keV ﬂux higher by a factor of about 7 than that at the
soft—to—hard transition. Such hysteresis behavior was ﬁrst noticed for GS 1124—68 and GK
339—4 (Miyamoto et al. 1995,) and has been well established for many BHCs. It means that
the spectral transition is not controlled by the mass aooretion rate alone, but depends on its
history. Most of the BHCs show a rapid ﬂux rise within a few days that causes the near—
instantaneous spectral transition (Gierlinski 85 Newton 2006), and then their ﬂuxes decay with
an e—folding time of several ten days into quiescence (sorne BHCs show a secondary ﬂare). It is
known that the spectral state begins with the initial LHS, then evolves through the VHS/IMS,
H88, and LHS during an outburst. However, about 8 BHCs such as XTE J1118+480 and
GRO J0422+32 remained in the LHS throughout their previous outbursts (Brooksopp et al.
2001). The very long duration of the initial LHS in XTE J1752—223 and the two long plateau
phases are rather uncommon for the BHC outbursts. Meyer—Hofrneister (Meyer—Hofrneister
2004) points out that systems with short orbital periods like XTE J1118+480 (4.1 hours) and
GRO J 0422+32 (5.1 hours) tend to have low peak lurninosities in their outbursts (and hence do
not show state transition) beoause srnaller accretion disks have less accumulated matter. The
long LHS observed in XTE J1752—223 might be related with a short orbital period. From our
observations, however, XTE J1752—223 also resernbles GX 339—4, which remained in the LHS
for a long period before transition into the HSS (MoClintook 85 Rernillard 2006). GX 339—4 has
a relatively long orbital period (1.7 days) arnong BHCs categorized in low—rnass X—ray binaries,
indicating a larger accretion disk size. In this case, the unusually long duration of the LHS
before the state transition would result from gradual Change in the accretion rate. It is still
unclear what causes the slow increase of the accretion rate in contrast with other X—ray novae.
Therefore, the determination of orbital period of XTE J 1752—223 should be important to Clarify
the nature of the long LHS period.

Let us explain the overall picture of the light curve of the XTE J1752—223 outburst. We
assume the generally accepted disk trunoation scenario in the LHS never though some other
soenarios have been proposed for the LHS, e.g. Liu et al. 2007, where the innermost radius
of the disk (Rm) is basically determined by the balance between the accretion rate and gas
evaporation rate (Meyer, Liu, 85 Meyer—Hofrneister 2000; Liu et al. 2002; Done, Gierlinski, 85
Kubota 2007). In this scenario, the LHS is the state where the accretion disk is truncated at
a larger radius than the lnnerrnost Stable Circular Orbit (ISCO :3 Sohwarzsohild radii for a
non—rotating BH), due to a low aooretion rate. As the accretion rate increases ( thin begins
in an outer part of the accretion disk), Rm decreases. When the radius decreases, the corona
around the disk cools down Via efﬁcient inverse Compton scattering of the soft disk photons and
exhibits softer X—ray spectra. Thus, the two phases in the LHS (B and D) can be interpreted
with a slightly higher aooretion rate in Phase D than that in Phase 13. Furthermore, when
the accretion rate eventually exceeds a critical rate required for the state transition, the gas

6

"
"7","evaporation Will not be strong enough to truncate the disk. Thus, Rm reaches the ISCO, and
the intense thermal radiation from the accretion disk, i.e. ultra—soft component, appears in soft
X—rays (Phase F in the HSS). The disk truncation scenario does not predict any time evolution
of Rm during the HSS. As seen in the light curve With a very smooth decay during the HSS, the
local accretion rate smoothly decreases With time. When it falls below the critical rate again,
the source comes back to the LHS (Phase H).

The signiﬁcant increase mainly in the 2—4 keV band suggests that the disk innermost
temperature (kTin) is relatively low. Preliminary ﬁts of the MAXI GSC data With the disk
blackbody model (Mitsuda et a1. 1984) during Phase F revealed that kTin was 0.4—0.7 keV
including a systematic uncertainty of 0.1 keV. The Swift XRT Observation taken on February
4, 2010 also showed that the blackbody temperature is about 0.5 keV (Curran et a1. 2010). This
temperature is lower than those of other BHCs such as GRO J1655—40 and XTE J1550—564
Whose kTin in the HSS exceeds 1 keV (Gierliiiski & Dene 2004). The vary 0f kTin is determined
by how much the accretion rate exceeds the critical rate, hence a 10W kTin indicates that the
accretion rate in the HSS is above the critical rate. It is known that the spectral transition
from the LHS t0 the HSS Will occur at around 10—20% Eddington luminosity, but With large
uncertainties (Wu et a1. (2010)). The kTi,1 fer the Schwarzsehild BH can be estimated to be
m 1.2keV(M/10M®)_1/4(77/1.0)1/4(h/1.7) (e.g., Makishima et a1. (2000)), Where his the spectral
hardening factor (Shimura & Takahara 1995), 77 is the Eddington ratio (L/LE), and M is the
mass of the central Object. Assuming that the maximum kTin is 0.6N0.7 keV and 77 is 0.1~0.2,
the black hole mass can be roughly estimated at 8.6—32 Mg. The GSC ﬂux in the 2—10 keV
range at the outburst peak (2010 January 23) was 9.7x 10—9 erg cm—2 s‘1 With a ~20% absolute
ﬂux uncertainty. Assuming that 1) the 2—10 keV ﬂux is 21—28 % 0f the bolometrie ﬂux based
on the disk blackbody model, and that 2) the Eddington luminosity is 1.5><1038(M/M®) erg
s_l, the distance to the source can be estimated as 5—10 kpe.

Fig. 1. MAXI/GSC false—color images during the period of December 20 to J anuary 19 (upper panel) and
J anuary 20 to February 28 (lower panel). Red: 2—4 keV, Green: 4—10 keV, Blue: 10—20 keV. 10O radius
area from XTE J1752—223 is extracted, and the source Clearly reddens because of the spectral transition.
There are many bright X—ray sources near XTE J1752—223 With a few hundreds of mCrab such as GX
9+1 and GX 3+1. Source and background regions used for the light curve analysis are shown by green
circles on both images.

Fig. 2. The MAXI light curve of XTE J1752—223 in four energy ranges (2—20, 2—4, 4—10, and 10—20
keV from the top to the fourth panel) in comparison With Swift/BAT (15—50 keV: the ﬁfth panel). The
hardness ratio between the 2—4 keV and the 4—10 keV bands is shown in the bottom panel. Right panel:
The period in the left panel When the plasma ejection was detected (J anuary 21 as shown by the dashed
line) is expanded.

Fig. 3. A hardness—intensity diagram during the outburst of XTE J1752—223. Data points during the six
phases (A to H) are shown by the different symbols. 6 hours integrations are used in Phase E, F and G,
While one—day integrations are used for the other phases. The spectral evolution generally moves in the
direction shown by arrows. Filled diamonds show the data When increased radio emissions, presumably
jets, were detected on 2010 J anuary 21.
