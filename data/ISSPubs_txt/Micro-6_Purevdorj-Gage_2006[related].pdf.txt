Only limited information is available concerning the effects of low-shear modeled microgravity (LSMMG) on
cell function and morphology. We examined the behavior of Saccharomyces cerevisiae grown in a high-aspect-
ratio vessel, which simulates the low-shear and microgravity conditions encountered in spaceﬂight. With the
exception of a shortened lag phase (90 min less than controls; P < 0.05), yeast cells grown under LSMMG
conditions did not differ in growth rate, size, shape, 01' Viability from the controls but did differ in the U
establishment of polarity as exhibited by aberrant (random) budding compared to the usual bipolar pattern g
of controls. The aberrant budding was accompanied by an increased tendency of cells to clump, as indicated :5
by aggregates containing ﬁve 01' more cells. We also found signiﬁcant changes (greater than 01' equal to twofold) 5
in the expression of genes associated with the establishment of polarity (BUD5), bipolar budding (RAXI, RAXZ, 8
and BUD25), and cell separation (DSEI, DSEZ, and EGTZ). Thus, low-shear environments may signiﬁcantly 8
