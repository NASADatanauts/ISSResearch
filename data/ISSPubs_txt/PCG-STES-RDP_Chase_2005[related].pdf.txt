A group I self—splieing intron contains an active site that allows it to
excise itself from a precursor RNA and ligate the ﬂanking exons,
generating an intact mRNA, tRNA 0r rRNA (Cech, 1993; Kruger et
al., 1982; Saldanha et al., 1993). This self—splieing reaction requires
only sufﬁcient magnesium ions (~2 mM) to fold the RNA and a
guanosine-nucleoside substrate (Cech, 1993; Kruger et aL, 1982;
Saldanha et al., 1993).
The self—splieing reaction is complex, involving the orchestration of
two successive transesteriﬁeation reactions, but it is carried out efﬁ-
ciently and accurately by the group I active site. The intron possesses
a binding site capable of recognizing a guanosine nucleoside and
activating its 3’ hydroxyl for nucleophilie attack at the 5’ splice site.
The 5’ spliee-site phosphate follows a uridine recognized in the
context of a U-G wobble pair Within the hairpin duplex at the 5’ end
of the intron (P1). Attack of the activated guanosine nucleophile at
the 5’ splice site liberates the 5’ exon and links the guanosine
substrate to the 5’ end of the intron. A structural rearrangement must
then occur, in Which the exogenous guanosine eXits the active site and
is replaced by a conserved guanosine (wG) at the 3’ terminus of the
intron (Been & Perrotta, 1991; Michel et al., 1989). The 5’ exon can
then attack at the 3’ splice site in a transesteriﬁeation reaction that is
chemically equivalent to the reverse of the ﬁrst step of splicing. This
reaction ligates the two exons and releases the group I intron.
Group I introns can easily be converted into tranS-acting ribo-
Zymes. Such molecules are capable of recognizing an RNA substrate
by base-pairing and activating the 3’ hydroxyl of a guanosine
nucleoside 0r wG for nucleophilie cleavage of the substrate (Zaug et
al., 1988). Ribozymes such as this have been used to extensively
characterize the endonuclease reaction of group I RNAs (Herschlag
& Cech, 1990; Shan et al., 2001).
Group I introns possess conserved core elements of secondary
structure (designated P1—P9 in Fig. 1a) organized into three domains,
‘ P1—P2, P4—P6 and P3—P9 (Cech et al., 1994). The active site is located
at the junction of the P4—P6 and P3—P9 domains. To generate a
