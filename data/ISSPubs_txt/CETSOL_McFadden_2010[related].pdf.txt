Abstract. This paper studies the Columnar to Equiaxed Transition (CET) in an Al-7wt%Si binary
alloy with and without Al-Ti-B grain reﬁner. A microgravity experiment was designed to produce a
CET in this alloy system. The experiment was ﬂown onboard the MAXUS-7 sounding rocket
platform, which achieved twelve minutes of microgravity. Examples of CET were successfully
produced during the unmanned ﬂight. Temperature data were recorded from thermocouples in the
crucible walls of the furnace. Post-mortem material characterization of the grain structure was also
performed. Subsequently a model of the furnace, which used a front-traoking model of solidiﬁcation
and an inverse heat calculation method, was developed. In this paper, results from the model are
compared to the experimental ﬁndings; agreement is found with the CET predictions. The results
from the model are then used to compare ﬁndings with the CET criterion of Hunt from the
literature. Agreement is found between the model predictions and the Hunt criterion.
Introduction
This paper presents a study on the Columnar to Equiaxed Transition (CET). A CET experiment was
designed for an Al-7wt%Si alloy. This experimental apparatus was launched on the MAXUS-7
sounding rocket. Thus, the experiment was performed under microgravity conditions during the free
fall in the MAXUS-7’s ﬂight trajectory. Under microgravity conditions, the effects of gravity on
ﬂuid ﬂow are greatly suppressed. Therefore, it is assumed that, under microgravity conditions,
liquid-solid phase transformations are controlled by diffusion. Thus, microgravity experimentation
provides a unique environment for studying fundamental diffusion-oontrolled solidiﬁcation of
alloys.

This paper explains details of analysis performed on the microgravity experiments with
assistance from a numerical model of the furnace. The model used a front-traoking method to
calculate the thermal conditions and solidiﬁcation macrostruoture that evolved during solidiﬁcation.
Essential Background Literature
Experimental Details and Results. The Swedish Space Corporation together with the European
Space Agency and EADS-Astrium launched the MAXUS-7 sounding rocket from the ESRANGE
site on 2 May 2006 [1]. A solidification experiment onboard this platform was given the acronym
MACE (standing for Metallic Alloys for Columnar Equiaxed solidification). Three separate
scenarios were performed in the experiment: MACE A, MACE B, and MACE C. All scenarios
involved the binary alloy Al-7wt%Si; however, MACE B included an Al-Ti-B grain reﬁner. The
details and main results from all three experimental scenarios have been published [2]. After post-
mortem analysis of the samples, it was shown that MACE A and MACE B produced a CET in the
macrostruoture. Further analysis and results of the CET from MACE A and MACE B are published
in [3]. For our purposes, within this paper, only MACE A and MACE B are considered.

"3","Modeling Details. To facilitate further analysis of the samples, a model of the MACE furnace was
developed [4]. This model used the front tracking method of McFadden and Browne [5] to simulate
the evolving macrostructure during the liquid-to-solid transformation. A11 inverse heat transfer
method was used to reconstruct the thermal conditions in the model. Preliminary results from this
model along with explanation of the main adjustable parameters within the model are presented
elsewhere [4]. The calculated temperatures agreed well with measured temperatures. Further post-
processing of the modeling results are presented here.
Results (Experimental versus the Model)
Fig. 1 shows the results of the simulated 2-D maerographs from the front tracking model [4] and the
experimental maerographs from references [2,3]. MACE A is shown on the left and MACE B is
shown on the right. The simulation from MACE A used 100 initial seeds (NO=100), whereas, the
MACE B simulation used 500 (NO=500). The seed positions were randomly distributed throughout
the initial liquid with a uniform probability. The undercooling required for seed initiation (or
nucleation) was also random and was based on a log-normal probability distribution of the seed
particles” diameters.

"4","In the ease of MACE B, the CET position in the experimental results was not clear to the eye.
Statistical post-proeessing 0f the maerograph showed that a CET existed. As demonstrated in Sturz
et a1. [2], the plot of average grain area along the longitudinal section of the sample revealed the
CET position. The average grain area was relatively large for the columnar region and relatively
smaller for the equiaxed region. Fig. 2 shows the measured grain areas in the longitudinal section,
with error bars, for MACE A (i) and MACE B (ii). The CET in MACE A occurred at around
position 147.5 mm and in MACE B, it occurred at around 132.5 mm. The columnar zone in MACE
B was quite mixed between equiaxed and columnar grains, hence the difﬁculty in observing the
transition.

Fig. 3: Grain area data along the longitudinal length of the sample (from model results)
The modeling results show clear CET positions. Calculating the grain area along the length of the
simulated results showed that when the number of seeds (NO) was 100, the CET was observed at
143 mm - ﬁg. 3(i). When the number of seeds was increased to 500 in the simulation, the CET
occurred at approximately 137 mm - ﬁg. 3(ii). The number of seeds used in the simulations was
approximated. The 2D seed densities used in the simulations are 23.1 0111'2 for MACE A and 115.7
em'2 for MACE B. A 3D to 2D conversion of seed density data is difﬁcult to interpret and was not
attempted. The seed data used in the simulation was selected to demonstrate the qualitative effect of
increasing the number of seeds (that is, the effect of adding a grain reﬁner). Agreements with the
measured CET positions are reasonable. Grain area values in the columnar region vary considerably
between the model predictions and the measured values. This discrepancy is due to the 2D nature of
the model and the lack of crystallographic orientation information in the front tracking model. In
reality, the columnar grains are 3D and may have some crystallographic misalignment that allows
the crystals to grow at an angle to the 2D plane [6]. Columnar misalignment was postulated to have
little effect 011 CET position [7]. This postulation seems to be supported here since the 2D model
with 110 crystallographic orientation ability predicts CET positions reasonably well. The model’s
grain area predictions in the equiaxed zone are reasonably good.
A Comparison to the Hunt CET Criterion. Hunt [8] developed a method for predicting
maerostruetures under steady-state, Bridgman furnace conditions. According to Hunt, it is possible
to produce columnar, equiaxed, or mixed structures by varying the pulling velocity and temperature
gradient (V and G) in a Bridgman furnace. The Hunt model considers an observer at the columnar
dendrite tips. Low temperature gradients (10w G) and high growth rates (high V) at the columnar
tips promote equiaxed growth. When an equiaxed volume fraction reaches 0.49, the equiaxed
growth is assumed to block the columnar front and a CET is said to occur. This blocking is
sometimes called “mechanical blocking” in the literature. Hunt developed the following inequality
for G to predict an equiaxed maerostrueture

where D0 is the seed density, ATN is the instantaneous heterogeneous nucleation undereooling for
seed particles, and ATC is the undereooling at the columnar tips. Hunt also presented a diagram with
V plotted against G to succinctly describe the conditions for columnar or equiaxed growth.
In this analysis, “mechanical blocking” is deemed to be sufﬁcient due to the dendritio (or non-
globular) nature of the grains. For dendritio structures it is assumed the any solutal interactions
occur only in the late stages of solidiﬁcation and after a coherent CET structure is deﬁned.
For a non-steady, transient situation (like in a casting), the Hunt diagram may be used to give an
estimate of the CET point. In this transient ease, the columnar tip velocity and the gradient at the
columnar tips must be known for each time value. A locus of combined G and V at the columnar
tips is superimposed onto the Hunt diagram. When the G-V locus passes into the equiaxed region of
the Hunt diagram, a CET is assumed to occur. This CET prediction method is a quasi-steady
approach and is reasonable because of the relatively low cooling and growth rates. Usually with
enthalpy macro models of solidiﬁcation, it is impossible to calculate the conditions at the columnar
tips; hence, G and V are calculated for some isotherm. Typically, the liquidus isotherm is selected to
get an estimate. However, a more accurate estimate is achieved by choosing an isotherm that is as
close as possible to the columnar tip temperature. The liquidus isotherm velocity and the columnar
tip growth rate may differ considerably, especially for low temperature gradients that change with
time.
The columnar tip velocity (growth rate) was taken from one of the columnar grains of the MACE A
simulation in fig. 1. Fig. 4 plots the columnar velocity versus the columnar tips position. During the
columnar growth we observe local peaks and troughs in the growth rate. This behavior seems quite
typical [9,10]. It is interesting to note that Gandin [9] proposed that CET occurs at a local peak in
columnar growth rate when the temperature gradient is sufﬁciently low. On the right-hand side of
the graph we see that the columnar velocity drops abruptly to zero; this signiﬁes impingement with
an equiaxed grain (that is, the CET). Just before this impingement we see some ﬂuctuations due to
thermal interactions with equiaxed grains. It would be interesting to know if a local peak in the
columnar growth rate was imminent as expected from Gandin’s ﬁndings.

Physical values for Al-Si alloys [9] are substituted into eq. 2. Fig. 4 also shows the undercooling at
the columnar tips. The tip undercooling varied between 3 t0 4 K. Thus, the average value of tip
undercooling, ATC, was taken as 3.5 K. For our analysis, we considered the 887.5 K isotherm (an
undercooling of 3.5 K) as an approximation for the columnar tip position. The authors investigated
this assumption and it was discovered that agreement between this isotherm and columnar tips was
excellent up to the point of impingement 0f the columnar zone with the equiaxed zone. For
reference, this isotherm is called the columnar isotherm. Fig. 5 shows the temperature gradient at
the columnar isotherm versus the columnar isotherm position. The temperature gradient at the
columnar isotherm started at around 30 K/em and reduced monotonically. At the 14.3 cm position
in the MACE A scenario, the columnar dendrite impinged with the equiaxed zone to give a CET.
The temperature gradient at this position was approximately 7.8 K/cm. In addition, the columnar
isotherm velocity at the CET position was calculated to be 0.0135 cm/s for MACE A.

Figs. 6 and 7 show the Hunt diagrams for MACE A and MACE B respectively. The columnar

isotherm’s G-V locus is superimposed onto each Hunt diagram. As explained earlier, where the G-V

locus crosses into the equiaxed region of the chart, this is Where the CET is predicted. The circular

marker in these diagrams shows Where the G and V values correspond to the CET.

Conclusions.

This paper presents results from a front-traeking model of the microgravity MACE experiment on

CET. Fig. 1 shows good agreement between the model’s prediction of CET and the experimental

ﬁndings. Figs. 6 and 7 show that agreement With the Hunt map was achieved When the nucleation

undereooling, ATN, was estimated as 3.4 K for MACE A and 3.0 K for MACE B.
