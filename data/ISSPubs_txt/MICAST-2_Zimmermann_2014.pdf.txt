Abstract. This paper provides an analysis Of the formation of intermetallic phases in AISi7Fe1
alloy in samples processed onboard the ISS. Based on aXial 2D eross-seetions Obtained from
regions of pure diffusive growth and also solidified with forced melt ﬂow, the sizes and distribution
of intermetallic B-AlsFeSi phases were determined for different solidification velocities. In diffusive
ease the phases are larger and more homogeneously distributed than in ease of induced melt ﬂow.
Additionally, especially for lower solidification velocity, the enrichment of Si and Fe in the centre
part Of the sample results in a few but rather large B-AlsFeSi particles.
Introduction

Aluminium—silieon east alloys are widely used in industry due to their low densities, low cost
and acceptable mechanical properties. The mechanical properties of aluminium alloys are however,
adversely affected by even small amounts of iron, which leads to the formation of intermetallic
compounds. In Al-Si-Fe alloy the B-AlsFeSi phase is the most harmful one, which solidifies as long
needles or platelets [1-4]. Insight in the three-dimensional structure of the B-AlsFeSi phase was
provided by serial sectioning [5] or computer tomography [6]. To modify the size of B-AlsFeSi
intermetallies and to understand the effect of convective ﬂow on the microstructure of an alloy with
intermetallic phases precipitate in the mush, artificial melt ﬂow, generated e.g. by rotating magnetic
field (RMF) was applied [3, 7, 8]. Recent investigations demonstrate that the formation of the [3-
A15FeSi phase in the interdendritie region may significantly reduce the melt ﬂow and therefore also
modify the secondary dendrite arm spacing.

To realize well-defined boundary conditions for the formation of the B-AlsFeSi phases
experiments in microgravity environment were performed in the frame of the ESA-MAP project
MICAST (merostrueture Formation in CASTing of Technical Al-Alloys under Diffusive and
Magnetically Controlled Convective Conditions) 0n-b0ard the International Space Station (ISS). In
the ESA payload Materials Science Laboratory (MSL) with Low Gradient Furnace (LGF) [9]
AISi7Fe1 alloy samples were directionally solidified under both purely diffusive and stimulated
convective conditions induced by a Rotating Magnetic Field (RMF). This allows for systematically
studies of the impact of the solidification velocity and ﬂuid ﬂow on the formation of intermetallic
B-AlsFeSi phase. This contribution deals with a comparative analysis Of the size and the distribution
of intermetallic B-AISSiFe phases Obtained from 2D aXial eross-seetions 0f the processed samples.
Experimental set-up of the microgravity experiments and sample analysis

In microgravity environment, five rod-like samples of diameter 7.8 mm and length 245.0 mm
from A1—6.5wt%Si-O.93wt%Fe alloy were processed [9]. By controlling the temperatures of the cold
and the hot zone of the MSL—LGF furnace a temperature gradient along the sample aXis is applied.

Melting and solidification of the metallic alloy is realized by a movement of the Bridgman type
furnace insert along the axis of the fixed sample with a defined speed. Additionally a rotating
magnetic field (RMF) can be applied to induce forced melt ﬂow in the melt.

All samples were directionally solidified in the same temperature gradient of 2 K/mm, but with
different values of the furnace velocity between V = 0.02 mm and V = 0.10 mm/s (see Table 1).
After a certain solidified length, which may allow for a steady-state columnar growth, the RMF was
switched on with frequency f = 57 Hz and magnetic field strength of B = 5.7 mT.

For analyzing 0f the microstructure the samples were sectioned in different parts. The
investigation of the distribution of the intermetallie B-AlsFeSi phase was performed at aXial cross-
seetions 0f the samples. Therefore, for each sample one eross-seetion from the diffusive growth
region (eut#1) and one eross-seetion from the region solidified with RMF (eut#2) were taken. The
position values relatively to the cold end of the samples are given in Table 1.

To allow for an unambiguous identification of the B-AlsFeSi phases a special preparation
technique with a basic final polishing step was developed. With this the B-AlsFeSi phases appear in
an intense dark color with respect to the primary a—Aluminium phase and the Al-Si eutectic. Fig. 1
show as an example a detail of the microstructure Obtained in sample MICAST FMS. Digital image
analysis was used for binarization. Then, the B-AlsFeSi phases can be identified automatically and a
detailed analysis Of the size and distributions of the phases was performed.

The binarized images show B-AlsFeSi phases of different sizes. Especially large B-AlsFeSi
phases may impede the growth of primary aluminium dendrites or reduce the interdendritie melt
ﬂow. Therefore, the B-AlsFeSi phases are Classified in groups of different lengths, determined with
image analysis using the Feret-maximum value. In Figs. 2 and 3 (bottom) all B-AlsFeSi phases
longer than 200 pm are shown.

"5","44 Solidification and Gravity VI

Fig. 4 shows the number of B-AlsFeSi phases longer than 200 pm, 300 pm, 400 um and 500 pm
for solidification velocities between V = 0.02 mm/s and V = 0.10 mm/s. In case of purely diffusive
solidification (plot left) for all velocities and all Classified lengths the number of phases is
significantly higher than in case of applied RMF (plot right). Also, for diffusive growth a maXimum
at intermediate velocities V = 0.04 mm/s to V = 0.06 mm/s eXist, whereas with forced ﬂow the
number of phases slightly decreases with increasing solidification velocity.

To investigate a potential impact of the dendritie array on the size of the B-AlsFeSi phases the
growth conditions were estimated. According to the phase diagram for the Al-rieh corner of a
ternary AlSiFe alloy [8, 10] the nucleation temperature of the B-AlsFeSi phase is at 616 OC,
resulting in a nucleation interval of 40 K. Therefore, for the applied temperature gradient of
2 K/mm, in a mushy zone region of about 20 mm in length intermetallie phases may grow. The
cooling rates lie in between 0.04 K/s and 0.20 K/s for solidification velocities V = 0.02 mm/s and
V = 0.10 mm/s, respectively. Growth rates of the B-AlsFeSi phases can be estimated from in-situ X-
ray measurements. For a cooling rate of 0.023 K/s a typical value of VB = 2 um/s was measured [6].
Assuming a linear correlation between the cooling rate and the growth velocity of the B-AlsFeSi
phases, this results in about VB = 3.5 um/s and VB = 17 um/s for solidification velocities
V = 0.02 mm/s and V = 0.10 mm/s, respectively. Therefore, based on this estimation, maximum
lengths of the B-AlsFeSi phases of more than 2500 um should be possible for all experimental
conditions.

In the diffusive ease for low solidification velocity of V = 0.02 mm/s the length of the B-AlsFeSi
phases is mostly less than 500 pm, which is much lower than the estimated maXimum size of about
2500 pm. The primary dendrite spacing for this velocity is M z 700 um. Therefore, the size of the
B-AlsFeSi phases growing in the interdendritie region may not be limited by the spacing of the
dendritie array but by the total amount of Fe (lwt.%) available for forming of the intermetallie
phase. For the high solidification velocity of V = 0.10 mm/s nearly all B-AlsFeSi phases are shorter
than 400 um (see Fig. 4). The primary dendrite spacing for this velocity is about M z 400 pm. This
might suggest that the size of the B-AlsFeSi phases growing in the interdendritie region was limited
by the spacing of the dendritie array.

In the ease with forced melt ﬂow in general a less amount of large B-AlsFeSi phases exists,
which is nearly independent of the solidification velocity. The reason may be convective transport
of growing intermetallie phases, also out of the mushy zone. Additionally the RMF induced a
secondary melt ﬂow [11], which results in an enrichment of Si and Fe in the centre part of the
samples. Therefore, here the growth condition for B-AlsFeSi phase is favored. As a result a few but
rather large B-AlsFeSi phases were detected in the centre (see Fig. 2).

Conclusion
This paper provides an analysis Of the formation of intermetallie phases in AISi7Fe1 alloy in
samples processed onboard the 188. Based on aXial 2D eross-seetions Obtained from regions of pure
diffusive growth and also from regions solidified with forced melt ﬂow, the sizes and distribution of
B-AlsFeSi phases were determined for different solidification velocities. In diffusive ease the phases
are larger and more homogeneously distributed than in case Of induced melt ﬂow. Additionally,
especially for lower solidification velocity, the enrichment of Si and Fe in the centre part Of the
sample results in a few but rather large B-AlsFeSi particles. In future the 3D structure of the [3-
A15FeSi particles will be determined using computer tomography, then allowing for a correlation
between 2D and 3D analysis.
