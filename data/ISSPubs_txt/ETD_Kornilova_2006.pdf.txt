Abstract—Pre— and postﬂight examinations of cosmonauts participating in missions ISS—3 to ISS—9 on the
International Space Station were performed using a computer—aided method of integrated assessment of the
oculomotor system. The role and signiﬁcance of the vestibular system in the eye tracking were determined; the
individual and general Characteristics of spontaneous oculomotor reactions and oculomotor reactions induced
by Visual and vestibular stimuli after a long—term stay at zero gravity (126—195 days) were determined; and the
Changes in the indices of oculomotor reactions were monitored. Studies of the vestibular function, intersensory
interactions, and the tracking function of the eyes in the crew members were performed on the second, ﬁfth
(sixth), and ninth (tenth) days of the readaptation period. The results of the postﬂight examinations showed a
signiﬁcant Change in the accuracy, velocity, and temporal Characteristics of eye tracking and an increase in the
vestibular reactivity. It was shown that the structure of Visual tracking (the accuracy of ﬁxational eye rotations
and smooth tracking) was disturbed (the appearance of correcting saccades, the transition of smooth tracking
to saccadic tracking) only in those cosmonauts who, in parallel to an increased reactivity of the vestibular input,
also had central Changes in the oculomotor system (spontaneous nystagmus, gaze nystagmus). With one excep—
tion, recovery of the indices of the accuracy of tracking eye movements in cosmonauts to the background level
in the selected period of examination was not observed, although a positive trend was recorded.
