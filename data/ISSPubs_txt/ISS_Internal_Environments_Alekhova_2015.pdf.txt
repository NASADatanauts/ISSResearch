Ahstraet—From swabs ol‘surt‘ztees ot'equipment and air samples ot‘tlie Russian segment ot‘the International
Space Station. nine strains ol‘spore—t‘orming bacteria ot'the genus Bacillus belonging to the species B. pumi/us,
B. lichen[lormis. B. swbli/ix, l)’. Inemueriunt. and B. anII'lu/ique/izc'ients' were isolated. The last species ()t‘bzteilli
0n the equipment ot'RS ISS was detected for the ﬁrst time. For these species ut‘baeilli. there are known strains
that can be opportunistic to humans, and their metabolites can cause biodegradation ot'equipment and mate—
rials. B. pmni/us found on ISS belongs to the group ot‘bzteterizt that exhibits a particularly high resistance to
’5; adverse environmental conditions. such as dehydration. ultraviolet and gamma radiation, and chemical dis-
