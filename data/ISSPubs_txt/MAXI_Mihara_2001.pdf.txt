ABSTRACT
We are developing Monitor of A11 Sky X—ray Image (MAXI) Which Will be mounted on the Japanese Experiment
Module of the International Space Station. MAXI is an all—sky X—ray monitor Which scans the sky in every 90
minutes. The sensitivity Will be as high as 7 mCrab (5 0 level) in one scan and 1 mCrab in one—week accumulation.
The GSC (Gas Slit Camera) instrument consists of twelve one—dimensional position sensitive proportional counters
using the Xe+C02 gas and the carbon ﬁber anodes of 10mm diameter. The Window size is 272 X 190 mm. The
position is obtained by the Charge division method. It is used to identify the source in the long rectangular ﬁeld—of—
View (1.5 X 80 degrees). Three cameras Will be set to cover the 1.5 X 160 degrees are. The position resolution is
essentially important, Which becomes better in the higher gas gain. We have tested gas mixtures of Xe+C02 With
C02 : 0.2%, 0.5%, 1%, and 3%. The C02 : 0.5% showed the most uniform gas gain, but has a little after pulses.
We Chose the Xe (99%) —1— C02 (1%) combination for the ﬂight counters. It can achieve the uniform gas gain in the
cell and negligible after—pulse in high operating voltage. The engineering model of the counter (EM1) was build. We
have tested the position resolution and the energy resolution across the counter. The position resolution and the
energy resolution depend on the X—ray energy. On the basis of these results, together With the collimator response,

we performed a realistic simulation.

1. MONITOR OF ALL-SKY X-RAY IMAGE (MAXI)
Monitor of All—sky X—ray Image (MAXI) is the ﬁrst astronomical payload to be placed on the International Space
Station (ISS)’s Japanese Experimental Module (JEM) in 2005 (Fig. 1 left) [1, 2, 3, 4]. MAXI has the size of 0.8 X
1.2 X 1.85 In and the weight of 500kg. Power, communication, and cooling ﬂuid are supplied from the JEM/ISS.
MAXI has two X—ray observational instruments, Gas Slit Camera (GSC) and Solid—state Slit Camera (SSC, Miyata
in this meeting). The GSC uses gas counters Which is sensitive in 2—30 keV. The SSC uses X—ray CCDs sensitive
in the soft X—ray (0.5—10 keV). Both instruments are s1it—cameras and have a long rectangular ﬁeld—of—View (FOV)
(Fig. 1 middle). With the combination of one—dimensional X—ray detector, the positions of the X—ray sources in the
FOV are determined (Fig. 1 right). The narrow FOV scans across the sky With the 90—minute orbital rotation of the
188. The GSC has two identical FOVs, one is facing forward and the other zenithal. The forward FOV is tilted up
by 6 degrees to avoid the earth and the atmosphere completely. There are non—operational periods in the orbit, such
as the South Atlantic Anomaly and the high—radiation polar regions. Although one FOV cannot observe the portion
of the sky Which to be observed from there, the other FOV can cover that region after or before 21 minutes, because
it is offset by 84 degrees. Thus MAXI can monitor almost the Whole sky in every 90 minutes, twice in most part.
As an all—sky monitor MAXI has unprecedented sensitivity in the hard X—ray band (0.5—30 keV). The purposes of
the all—sky monitor are not only the discoveries of new X—ray sources, but also the Challenge to the cosmology models
by measuring the large scale structure of the universe Via the distribution of distant active galaxies as well as the
cosmic X—ray background. The sensitivity is 7 mCrab (5 0 level) in one scan and 1 mCrab in one—week accumulation
[1, 3]. The former is as sensitive as can detect the X—ray afterglow of the gamma—ray burst if it scans Within 290 s
after the burst. The latter is as sensitive as can detect hundreds of faint extra—galactic objects (AGNs and galaxy
Clusters). The AGNs (quasars, BL Lac objects, Seyfert galaxies) are variable in a time scale of 100 s N years. It is
the ﬁrst experiment to monitor the variability of the extra—galactic sources Without a bias.

One—dimensional X—ray detector is used to determine the source positions in the rectangular FOV.
2. GAS SLIT CAMERA (GSC)
GSC consists of twelve cameras With proportional counters. Two cameras are set in a ’pillar’ (a unit) as arrows in
Fig. 1 left indicate, and watch the same FOV. The triangular part above the counters contains slats collimators to
limit the FOV to 1.5 X 80 degrees. There is a slit on the top of the triangle to transmit the X—ray from the sources
onto the counter. Three units (i.e. six cameras) are placed to cover 1.5 X 160 degrees. The 10 degrees from the edge
are abandoned, because some of them are shadowed by other modules on 188.

Fig. 2 is the top View of one GSC ﬂight model counter. The Window size is 272 X 190 mm, Which is about
A4—paper size. The opening area is 445.9 cm2. Twelve counters make 5350 cm2 in total. The gas is the mixture of
Xe and C02 With total pressure of 1.4 atm at 0 OC. The carbon ﬁbers With 10 am in diameter are used for anodes.
The resistances are about 33 k9, and the length is 333 mm. The position is obtained by the Charge division method.
The preampliﬁers (A225 hybrid IC) are connected to both ends of the anode. The pulse height from the left L and
that from the right R are obtained. The position measure PM is deﬁned as PM = (R — L)/ (R + L). The incident
X—ray position is determined by PM using the calibrated curve.

Figure 2. Top View of the MAXI/GSC Flight Model counter. The unit is [mm]. Gray parts are Be Window, Which
is supported by the beams of 1.4mm Width and 17mm height. The Be Window area is 445.9 cm2. There are 6 cells
With carbon anodes, Which are surrounded by the 10 veto cells. Each cell has three beams. The counter is made of
titanium. It was Chosen because it has a similar expansion coefﬁcient With beryllium.

"3","3. ANOMALOUS GAS GAIN
To obtain the good position resolution with this proportional counter, high pulse height is needed. The noise is
dominated by the Johnson noise of the resistive anode. Therefore the position resolution has AX / X oc PH‘1R0'5
relation. Thinner wires with higher resistance can improve the position resolution, but 10 ,um is almost the limit of
the handling. As will be shown in §4, the GSC will be operated in rather high gas gain (N 6000), compared with
that of the usual proportional counters (gas gain of ~1000). When we raised the high voltage, we encountered the
hard tail problem.
3.1. Hard tail With C02 2 3% gas
A hard tail as shown in Fig. 3 emerged at high voltage (1600V) with the common Xe + C02 : 3% gas. The pulse
height ratio of the hard tail to the normal peak became larger at higher voltage. It exists when we irradiate X—ray
near the anode wire, and not exist off the wire (Fig. 3). The proportional counter of the same gas but with metal
anode also showed the hard tail in the high gas gain. Thus, it is not the problem of the anode wire, but the gas.

Figure 3. Hard tail appeared when operating in rather high gas gain (HV 2 1600V). It exists only when the X—ray
is irradiated near the anode (left: off—wire, right: on—wire). The gas was C02 2 3%, and the X—ray was Mo—K.
3.2. Slant beam method
To investigate this phenomena, we used the slant beam method. We tilted the X—ray beam within the plane which
the anode and the beam make. Fig. 4 shows the case when the beam crosses the anode wire. We used 6’ = 45 degrees.
Let X the direction of the anode and Z the depth from the window. By using the one—dimensional position sensitive
counter, we know X for each X—ray event. Since X and Z correspond to each other in the slant beam method, we
know the depth Z , where the X—ray is absorbed.

Fig. 5 upper is the event plots by the slant beam method in Z and PH plane. The PH changed With the depth Z .
The gas gain is normal at the Window and the bottom of the cell, rises towards the anode, has maximum at 3mm
from the anode, and then goes down. The hard tail was due to the different gas gain on the position Where the
X—ray was absorbed, The Y—scan 0f the slant beam method can make a gain map in the cell. It showed that the gain
variation is symmetric 0n the anode and very similar to the shape of the electric ﬁeld [5]. We deﬁne the anomalous
gas gain factor g, as PH 2 Q0 ( 1 + g ), Where Q0 is the pulse height of the normal peak. The g is the function
of Z , and the maximum of g is denoted as gmam. What causes the anomalous gas gain ? Fig. 5 also shows the HV
dependency. The anomalous gas gain factor increased With high voltage. Actually it was proportional to the normal
gas gain Q0 itself [5]. This means that the additional pulse height of the hard tail from the normal peak increases as
oc Q3. We used Mo—K X—ray because Ti—K and Cu—K cannot penetrate very far. The X—ray mean free path in Xe of
1.4 atm is 4.7 mm for Ti—K, 8.0 mm for Cu—Ka, and 28.8 mm for Mo—Ka.

We deﬁne the anomalous gas gain factor g as shown in the ﬁgure. Q0 is the pulse height of the normal peak. The
pulse height at depth Z is written as Q0 ( 1 + g ), Where g is the function of Z .

"
"5","3.4. Ar —|— C02 and Ar —|— CH4 combinations

We investigated this phenomenon With Ar + C02 and Ar + CH4 gases in the gas—ﬂow counter. Fig. 6 upper shows
the M—Curves With C02 : 3%, 5%, 10%, and 20%. M—Curve is also seen, but higher density of C02 is needed to have
the similar M—shape (10% in Ar instead of 3% in Xe). Moreover, the C02 : 3% showed V—Curve. The V—ourve can
be understood as the expanded M—Curve. The position of gmam is expanded outward in the smaller density of C02.

We also tried Ar —1— CH4 2 5%, 10%, 20% combinations. All of them showed V—ourve (Fig. 6 lower), although the
depth of V—ourve is shallow in the high CH4 density. Higher density of CH4 (30%) and higher total pressure (7atm)
can make the curve M—shaped [7].

Thus the M—ourve is the common phenomenon in the cylindrical proportional counters operating in the high gas
gain. However, the extent of M—shape and the amount of gmam in the same gas gain are different With the combination
of the main gas (Xe or Ar) and the quenching gas (C02 or CH4). They also depend on the density of the quenching
gas and the total pressure.

First we reduced the C02 as much as possible. The results of C02 : 0.2% is shown in Fig. 7 left. It showed V—Curve.
However, this gas has another big problem of cross talks (§3.6) and cannot be used. We increased C02 density as
0.5, 1.0%, and took the M—Curves with a similar gas gain. C02 : 0.5% gas is almost free from the cross talks. But
ﬁnally, we took C02 2 1% as the gas for the ﬂight counter. It is the safety side of the cross talks problem. It has
M—Curve, but shows better spectrum than the C02 : 3% (Fig. 7 lower).

Figure 7. The M—Curves 0f Xe + C02 : 0.2, 0.5, 1.0, and 3.0% gases. The gas gains are adjusted to be similar.
The X—ray is Mo—K. The lower is the spectra obtained by the projection of the upper curves to the PH axis. The
‘soft tail’ is obvious in C02 : 0.2%, and the hard tail is in C02 : 3%, which originate from V—Curve and M—Curve.
3.6. UV lights and quenching gas hypothesis
As Cited in §3.3, the additional pulse height of the hard tail is proportional to the square of the gas gain. It suggests
a secondary mechanism which is caused by the gas ampliﬁcation. For example, UV light is one of such candidates.
(1) If the amount of the UV lights would be proportional to the gas gain, and (2) if extra electrons are ejected by the
UV lights from the quenching gas, the number the extra electrons is proportional to the gas gain. Those electrons
are also gas—ampliﬁed at the anode, which end up as the additional Charges proportional to the square of the gas
gain. In this case, ejection of the extra electrons must occur in the vicinity of the anode, because the rise—tirne 0f
the pulse was faster than 0.5 ,us, and the ejection of the photo electron from the Be window was rejected.

With Xe + C02 : 0.2% gas, We had another big problem of cross talks. When Mo—K X—ray was irradiated in
one cell, the cross talk appeared in the next cell. The cross talk pulses come in several micro seconds later than the
main pulse. The after pulses in the same cell were also seen. The cross talk is considered to be an after pulse to the
next cell, which is caused by the photo electrons ejected from the Be window by the UV lights. The several micro
seconds is the drifting time from the Be window to the anode. The pulse height of the cross talk is not constant, but
1% of events showed more than 3.7keV pulse heights for Mo—K (17.5keV). The pulse height of the cross talks was
roughly proportional to the square of the gas gain. If we consider that the UV lights can reach the Be window, it is
the same story as the hard tail. At least, the above hypothesis (1) was proved.

Further study with the Y—scan 0f the slant beam method reveiled follows. The pulse height of the cross talk
depends on the X—ray absorbed position in the main cell. When the X—ray stops in the Closer side to the Be 0f the

"
"7","next cell, it has large cross talk. When it stops in the further side to it, the pulse height of the cross talk is very
small. This would be explained by the shadow of the UV lights by the anode. Then the UV lights would be created
in a very small region comparable to the anode diameter (10mm), and the avalanche would occur in one side, not at
all around the wire.

The gmam can be understood as the typical position where the most of the UV lights are absorbed by the quenching
gas. It is a natural supposition from the fact that we had cross talks and after pulses in the V—Curve gas, and not in
the M—Curve gas. The V—Curve happens in the insufﬁcient quenching when the UV lights can reach the Be window.
There is not a proof for the hypothesis (2), but some of the quenching gas would eject electrons, or excited quenching
gas would have smaller work function to produce electrons and eject electrons with smaller collision energy. This
could be an explanation candidate for the anomalous gas gain.

3.7. Shape of electron cloud hypothesis
An interesting relation was found between M / V—Curves and the shapes of electric Clouds. Fig. 8 upper is the simulated
distribution of the electrons when the ﬁrst electron reaches the anode (by the garﬁeld software). In the Ar+C02
: 3% gas, the near—anode event has round shape, but the window event has an elongated shape along the wire
(wide), which has considered to have less space—Charge effect. Then it had V—Curve. In the Ar+C02 = 20% gas,
the near—anode event has round shape as well, but the window event has an elongated shape vertical to the wire
(high), which is considered to have more space—Charge effect. Then the curve is M—Curve. By the mechanism of the
space—Charge effect the gain curve may be related to the width/height ratio. Fig. 8 lower are the graphs for Ar+CH4,
Ar+C02, and Xe+C02. Compared with Fig. 6 and Fig. 7, the curves are very similar. However, the relation between
the space—Charge effect and the width/height ratio is not Clear.

"8","4. PERFORMANCE OF THE ENGINEERING (EMl) COUNTER
As discussed in the previous sections, we decided to use C02 2 1.0 % for the ﬂight counter. The engineering counter
(EM1) was built by Metorex Company, Finland, and delivered to RIKEN in April 2001. It is called ‘engineering’,
but actually the ﬁrst counter of the ﬂight model. It has the ﬂight quality and have a little possibility to be launched.
The results are shown in the ﬁgures; the Energy linearity (Fig. 9 left), the HV—PH relation (Fig. 9 right), the Energy
resolution (Fig. 10 left), the Position resolution (Fig. 10 right), the Position error (Fig. 11), and the Gain uniformity
(Fig. 12). P3 and P4 are points on the counter; P3 (Xz—Smm, Y=0mm on—wire), P4 (X:—5mm, Y:14mm oﬂ—wire).

Figure 12. This is the gain map of EMl counter obtained by Mo—K at 1600V. X—ray was irradiated in every 2 X
1 mm grids. The color level is 10 steps in 1000—2000 Ch. The gain was uniform within i5% in one cell. The gain
difference of the anodes was i7%. We selected the carbon wires of similar resistances and mounted them in one
counter to achieve a uniform gain. The right is the cross section at X 2 —5mm (P3). The high gain near the anode
is due to the hard tail.

"10","5. OBSERVATION SIMULATION
Based on the obtained performance of the test and EMl counters, we performed the simulations of MAXI/GSC
observations [8]. First, we consider instrumental properties for the whole assembled system (§5.1). The second part
deals with scanning of any sources with given celestial coordinates in the sky by considering the ISS orbital motion
and integrating all the GSC units (§5.2). Simulations of X—ray backgrounds by the cosmic X—ray background and
the cosmic Charged particles are described in §5.3.
5.1. Simulations of source scanning With GSC
Let’s consider a source moving into the FOV of a slit collimator as the camera moving across the sky. Exposure
T is deﬁned as the time duration between the source moving into and moving out off the FOV (N3 deg) in the 9
direction (for the simple case for the central GSC units, T N3 deg/w N 45s where w is the angular velocity of the
188 of 4 arcmin s_l). The Monte Carlo simulation was designed for the scanning processes of a source with constant
X—ray ﬂux density fx, at elevation angle gb, and with exposure T .

Firstly, a series of incident photons onto the GSC slits is simulated within time T , in a way that the time interval
675 of two successive photon events following exponential distribution, as expected from the Poissonian statistics of
photon emission/absorption processes. Each photon is registered with the arrival time ti, energy Ei, and incident
position on the slits. Ez- is drawn from the ultimate spectral energy distribution of the X—rays before detection. The
azimuth angles of the incident photons can then be determined from their arrival time ti. With the photon incident
aspect and energy known, we can trace each photon along its path into the collimator, and subsequently, the detector
window and gas counter. A photon is discarded if it either fails to pass through the collimator, or is absorbed in the
Be—window, 0r penetrates the anode cell. Survival photons are taken as ‘detected’ X—ray events.

Laboratory calibration data for the energy—pulse height relation and the energy resolution (pulse height ﬂuctu—
ations) were used for converting the photon energy to pulse height in the gas counters. The position dependence of
the gas gain or ‘hard—tail effect’ (§3, [6]) was taken into account properly. The ‘measured’ absorption positions of
photons are converted from the ‘actual’ position X in ray—tracing by using the calibrated position measure vs. X
relationship.

5.2. Putting all together

Next we calculated the trajectories of stars moving across the FOV 0f slit camera in the scanning processes for both
the forward and the zenithal Views, using the information of the ISS orbits and the attitude of the GSC units. This
enables us to determine, for a star at any given celestial position in the sky, the time of starting to move into the
FOV, the exposure T , and the elevation angle gb, i.e. the parameters needed as inputs for the simulations of source
scanning/detection. As a useful example, we show in Fig. 13 the exposure time of sources as seen by the three GSC
units in one FOV. For the two side GSC units, the exposure time depends on the latitude of a star in the orbital
coordinate systems, but it is constant for the central unit.

By combining these results with the above scanning/detecting processes, we are able to simulate complete scanning
processes of the whole sky with the MAXI/GSC, by assuming a population of celestial X—ray sources. The simulated
‘observational’ data comprise photon registration time, left and right pulse heights (thus the position measure), the
detector and anode IDs. The spatial and energy information of the X—ray sources can be re—constructed by analysis
of these data.

5.3. Backgrounds

There are two methods for the simulations of the cosmic X—ray background (CXB). One is to divide the whole sky
into grids with elements which are much smaller than the point spread function of the GSC, and then to treat each
element as a point source; however, this is CPU—time consuming. Alternatively, we used another method by taking
the advantage of the CXB isotropicity. The idea is that, during the scanning processes, the detectors are seeing the
diffuse background emission with the same X—ray brightness*, regardless of which part of the sky is actually being
seen. The expected photon ﬂux density at the slits within a solid angle in any direction in the FOV can be obtained
and the above simulations of photon detection are used.

*In fact this is not the case as the CXB is modiﬁed by Galactic absorption in the soft X—ray band. However, this effect is
not signiﬁcant in the whole MAXI/GSC energy band for most part Of the sky, and, if needed, can be compensated ultimately
by using Monte Carlo drawing if the probability of absorption, or optical depth, is known.

Figure 13. left: Source exposure time as functions of source orbital latitude for three GSC units in one ( forward

by two FOVs successively in one complete orbit. The exposure time is the full Width at bottom of the scan proﬁle.
right: Effective area of 1 center unit (2 cameras), averaged While a source moves across FOV by the scanning. qﬁ is
the photon incident angle relative to the detector normal. The low energy transmission is limited by the Be—Window.
The difference of the effective areas in 2—15 keV is by the decrease of the slit area With gb. The difference becomes
smaller at higher energies by the compensation effect, i.e. the stopping power increases at larger Q5 because the travel
length in the gas is longer.

The simulation of detector background (DBG) caused by cosmic Charged particles is straightforward, but is
uncertain due to the unknown intensities of these particles in orbit. We assumed in our simulations a power law
spectrum for the DEC With a photon index F20 in 1—30 keV and normalization as two times as the room background,
Which is 2 X (4.5 X 10—4) C s‘1 cm_2 keV‘1 at 1keV. This is the value after the anti—coincidence between carbon
anodes, and carbon anode and veto.

6. RESULTS OF SIMULATIONS
The ﬁrst—hand outcomes are simulated photon events data resembling the read—out given by the on—board processors,
namely, the time and the IDs of detectors/Wires of photon, the pulse height Channels of left and right readouts,
Which can be used as inputs for the MAXI data analysis tools. Moreover, the simulation code can also be used to
examine and quantify some instrumental Characteristics, and to produce anticipated ‘scientiﬁc results’ by analysis of
the simulated data.
6.1. Effective area and point spread function
The detection efﬁciency, or effective area Aeff for the assembled system can be obtained by a direct comparison of
the detected and source counts. It is dependent on photon energy E and photon incidence aspect, i.e. Aeﬂ:(E, 6’, gb).
Since MAXI operates in a scanning mode in Which a source moves across the FOV With 6’ varies from —6’max to Qmax,
it is more meaningful to use the effective area averaged over 6’, i.e. <Aeff>(E, gb). We show in Fig. 13 the averaged
(Aeﬂ:>(E, Q5) for a unit as a function of photon energy at several Q5 angles. The Virtue effective area With respect to
a given source depends on the number of GSC units (either 1 or 2, see Fig. 13) Which are actually seeing the source
as well as the respective Q5 angles, both determined by the source position and the ISS orbit.

The point spread function (PSF) can be derived by mapping the spatial distribution of detected events from an
input point source on the detector X (anode) and Y (scanning direction, or time) space, and much meaningfully,
de—projected back onto the 6’ — Q5 space. Fig. 14 shows the PSF at 8keV photon energy for sources With incident
angle Q5 2 Odeg (left) and 20 deg (right), respectively. At large incident Q5 angles, a tail emerges (right panel) With
the extent increasing With gb, Which results from slant incidence of photons and becomes prominent for photons With
higher energies, i.e. larger mean free paths in the gas counter.

at large Q5 a tail appears in the Q5 direction for high energy photons caused by slant incidence of photons.
6.2. Crab count rate and in—orbit data rate
One good indicator of the capability of X—ray detectors is the yielded count rate in observing the Crab Nebula—the
standard calibration source in X—ray astronomy. As a useful example, we listed in Table 1 the simulated Crab count
rate as observed With one GSC in the 1—30 keV band for various off—axis angle Q5. For on—aXis scanning (Q5 2 0 deg) this
yields N 10 C s‘1 per GSC in 1—30 keV When averaged over the scan time. Note that 4 GSC observe the source, if the
orbital latitude is Within i 40 degrees. Then the average count rate is N 40 C s_l. Incorporating the source exposure
in Fig. 13 one may have a rough estimate about source counts accumulated in the scanning With the MAXI/GSC.
Then by sealing the source ﬂuxes to that of Crab (1 Crab : 4 X 10‘8 erg s‘1 om‘2 in 1—30 keV), we can know the
flux of the source.

"
"13","The estimation of data rate is important in designing the on—board signal processing electronics and telemetry,
as well as estimation of the dead time for strong X—ray sources. This can be easily obtained from the simulations.
We show in Table 2 the estimated data rate for the total 12 GSC for one orbit data—taking. It should be noted that,
however, since the ‘detected’ counts are dominated (N 85%) by detector particle background, the estimated total
counts depend strongly on the assumption on the DBG rate. The values given in the table 2 were obtained based
on the above DBG model in §5.3, and should be taken as a reference value only. More accurate estimation has to
rely on more realistic modeling/measurement of the DBG.

6.3. Simulations of scientiﬁc results of MAXI

For demonstration purpose we show here examples of simulated observational results of the MAXI/GSC. Fig. 15
shows simulated X—ray light curves of the Galactic neutron star binary (burster) X1608—52 (left) and the Seyfert
galaxy MCG—06—30—15 (right) for one month data—taking. A power law photon index of —1.9 and —1.8 was assumed
in the MAXI band for X1608 and MCG—06—30—15, respectively. The detector backgrounds were subtracted. The
input data are from ASCA observations of the two sources, respectively.

Fig. 16 shows the all—sky X—ray image obtained with the MAXI/GSC for ﬁve months data—taking, with the detector
particle background subtracted. The input X—ray sources are from the HEAO—l source catalog as well as the CXB.

7. SUMMARY
The MAXI mission was introduced and the design of the GSC ﬂight—model counter was shown. The detailed
investigation on the hard tail was explained. The M—Curves of Xe+C02, Ar+COg, and Ar+CH4 were presented
with various COg/CH4 densities. The anomalous gas gain might occur when the quenching gas absorbs the UV
lights near the electron—avalanche region. Or it might be by the space—Charge effect depending on the shape of the
electron Cloud. The engineering model counter (EM1) was made and tested. The various results were shown, which
was almost as expected. We are ready to move on to the production phase of GSC ﬂight model. The observation
simulation was performed and the current results were summarized.
