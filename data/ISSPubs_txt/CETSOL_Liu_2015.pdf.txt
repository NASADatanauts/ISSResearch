Abstract—Formation of grain structure and segregation during solidiﬁcation of reﬁned Al—7 wt.%Si alloys under microgravity is simulated using a
two-dimensional aXi-symmetrical Cellular Automaton-Finite Element (CAFE) solidiﬁcation model. This fully integrated model resolves a complex
interplay between heat transfer at the macroscale and grain structure evolution and microsegregation formation at the mesoscale. Direct comparison
with benchmark experiments performed under microgravity conditions of the International Space Station is carried out. Boundary conditions used in
the simulations are deduced from the experimental measurements of temperature. Qualitative agreement is achieved concerning CET (columnar-to-
equiaxed transition) position, CET transition mode (sharp 0r progressive), distributions of grain elongation factor and equivalent diameter, and dis-
tribution of eutectic fraction. The inﬂuences of pulling velocity and thermal gradient on grain structure and intergranular segregation are correctly
reﬂected and are discussed. Moreover, we take advantage of the simulation results to study the effect of otherwise inaccessible parameters such as the
degree of constitutional undercooling and the amplitude of the undercooled region. Another originality of this paper is to conduct quantitative com-
parisons between experiments and simulations Which allows discussion of the improvements needed in the simulation.
