ABSTRACT
The Hyperspeetral Imager for the Coastal Ocean (HICO) is the ﬁrst spaeeborne imaging spectrometer designed to
sample the coastal ocean. HICO samples selected coastal regions at 92 In ground sample distance with full spectral
coverage (88 channels covering 400 to 900 nm) and a high signal-to-noise ratio to resolve the complexity of the coastal
ocean. HICO has been Operating on the International Space Station since October 2009 and collected over 8000 scenes
for more than 50 users. We have been using HICO data to study major rivers and estuaries in the US and Asia. Our
results show the advantages of HICO’s additional spectral Channels and higher spatial resolution for studying these
complex coastal waters. We use these data to suggest requirements for spatial and spectral sampling for future ocean
color sensors.

1. INTRODUCTION
The coastal ocean is a rich and complex environment. Over half of humanity lives on the coast or along river systems,
utilizing water resources for transportation, waste disposal, ﬁsheries, and industries such as Oil and gas production. At
the same time it is a difﬁcult environment for Visible remote sensing; ocean scenes are dark relative to land scenes
because of water absorption, and coastal scenes are often spatially and speetrally complex due a wide assortment of
sediments from land runoff, as well as pigments from biological productivity, such as plankton blooms. All Of these
color agents are mixed together by tidal forcing and strong coastal currents. T0 unravel this complexity the
Hyperspeetral Imager for the Coastal Ocean (HICO) was designed as the ﬁrst spaeeborne imaging spectrometer to
speciﬁcally sample the coastal ocean. HICO targets selected coastal regions at 92 In ground sample distance with full
spectral coverage (88 channels between 400 to 900 nm), and a high signal-tO-noise ratio to resolve the complexity of the
coastal oceanl’z. The 0n-0rbit radiometric calibration of HICO is maintained using ground reference sites and the
spectral calibration is maintained using the atmospheric and solar absorption lines3 .
HICO has been Operating on the International Space Station since October 2009 and to date has captured over 8000
images for more than 50 users. Further information about HICO, current HICO projects and access to the data is
available through the Oregon State University HICO website (http://hieo.Coas.0reg0nstate.edu ). The initial Ofﬁce of
Naval Research funded HICO mission was completed in December 2012. Since January 1, 2013 HICO Operations have
been supported by the NASA International Space Station Science Program. NASA Operations include the distribution of
HICO data through the NASA Ocean Color Website (http://oeeaneolor.gsfc.nasa.gov ). We have been using HICO data
to study rivers and estuaries in the U.S. and Asia. HICO’s higher spatial resolution and continuous spectral sampling
have proven extremely valuable for the studies reported here.
2. SPECTRAL ANALYSIS METHODS
A key advantage of HICO is the continuous spectra for each pixel; this Opens up the Opportunity for new water remote
sensing algorithms that go beyond band ratios, and build upon analytic spectroscopy techniques developed in
laboratories over decades. One example is derivative analysis; derivatives highlight abrupt Changes in spectral shape
indicating absorption and scattering features. Using derivative analysis we can assess the best wavelengths needed to
sample various features, such as bottom sediments, river plumes 0r algal b1001ns4’5 ’6. In effect, derivative analysis is just
one Of many methods that attempt to reduce the dimension of a hyperspeetral data set to focus it on speciﬁc
biogeoehemieal water constituents. Other approaches include the reduction of the dimension of hyperspeetral data sets
by linear methods such as principle components7’8, 0r nonlinear methods such as manifold 1earning9.

"2","2.1 Derivative Analysis
The use of derivative analysis for spectroscopic data is a standard technique in laboratory analysis, and we adapt those
techniques for use with data from HICOIO’“. In particular, the derivative is computed with a Savitzky-Golay (S—G)
smoothing and differentiation ﬁlter”. The nominal HICO data spectral resolution is 5.7 nm, and using the S—G ﬁlter the
spectral data is interpolated to a 2 nm grid, with a 3rd order polynomial and a window length of 9 nm.
Oddly, in order to reduce the dimension of a hyperspectral data set, we ﬁrst increase the dimension by estimating
derivatives of the spectra (the slope) with respect to wavelength. The reason is illustrated in Fig. 1, which shows the
spectra taken from a transect across the Elwha River plume. As the transect crosses the river plume, the (negative) slope
of the spectra shows a rapid change between 700 — 730 nm, presumably due to a combination of bright backscatter from
sediments and strong absorption by water in this spectral region. An estimate of the slope from the ﬁrst derivative
centered at 716 nm is sensitive to the signal from the river plume, and relatively insensitive to other constituents in the
water or atmosphere.

2.2 Phase Difference Function
When spectra are described by continuous signals parameterized by wavelength, it is possible to study the intrinsic
geometry of the data. Using hyperspectral data and its derivatives, we deﬁned a phase difference function that can be
valuable in detecting rapid changes in the intrinsic geometry of spectra. Computing the ﬁrst and second derivative
deﬁnes a 3-dimensional geometry for a spectrum, (X,y,z) = (s, s’, s”) = 20»), where s0») is the spectrum of interest, and
s’, s” denote its ﬁrst and second derivative with respect to the wavelength, 9». The vector 20») deﬁnes a natural phase
angle, and rapid changes of the phase of 20») over a spatial transect, centered on narrow spectral bands, can be used to
detect fronts and interfaces as we illustrate below. More details of the method are described in13 .
3. RIVER SYSTEMS
3.1 Elwha River, Washington, USA
The Elwha River is being returned to its natural state. The largest dam-removal project in history began in September
2011 on the Elwha River of Washington State. The project, which aims to restore the river ecosystem and increase
imperiled salmon populations that once thrived there, provides a unique opportunity to better understand the implications
of large-scale river restoration”. One of the consequences was the release of more than 19 million cubic meters of
sediment stored in both reservoirs into the downstream system. We have been monitoring the sediment plume entering
the Straits of Juan de Fuca at the Elwha River mouth to look at the redistribution of those sediments. Figure 1 is an
example of the Visible sediment plume and the use of derivative products to map that plume.
3.2 Yangtze River, China
The Yangtze (Changjiang) River, the largest river in China and ﬁfth largest in the world, provides a dramatic example of
sediment and nutrient transport. The Yangtze River inputs a large amount of nutrients and sediments into the East China
Sea (ECS) which is home to one of the largest and most productive ﬁsheries in the world. Construction and ﬁlling of

"
"3","Three Gorges Dam is dramatically reducing the water ﬂow and nutrient input to the ECS affecting this important
ﬁshery”. The Yangtze carries a large sediment load16 and the coastal waters are highly reﬂective as shown in Figure 2.
Figure 2 shows a sequence of clear HICO images of the Yangtze River in China along with typical plots of the second
derivative of the spectrum with respect to wavelength. The wavelengths around 620 nm are sensitive to sediment
concentrations, and MERIS17 uses a 620 nm channel to estimate sediment. As also pointed out bylg, who studied
phytoplankton pigments using HICO, hyperspectral images allow us to optimize the wavelengths used in product
algorithms for speciﬁc regions. In the Yangtze River region, for example, the maximum sensitivity to sediment
concentration occurs at 605 nm rather than 620 nm. Our principal component method, like optimized band ratio
methods18 will weight the sediment product algorithm with an optimized sediment maximum that is trained on regional
data (Fig. 3).

"4","3.3 Columbia River, USA
The Columbia River is the largest river in the Western United States collecting water from 5 states and British Columbia,
Canada. The Columbia River plume is one of the dominant features of the California Current System and it plays a key
role in the physical and biogeochemical functioning of that system off the Oregon and Washington coasts. The
traditional picture of the Columbia plume is that it is oriented southwest offshore the Oregon coast in summer and north
along the Washington coast in Winter. Recent studies by Hickey et al.19 have shown that it is more complex and
typically bi-directional in the summer With branches both north and south With the features moving in response to
changing Wind stress. The physics is now well known and the complex plume dynamics have been modeled in detailzo.
Tides, river ﬂow, Wind forcing and large scale circulation patterns all play a role controlling the size and location of the
plume.
Derivative analysis can be combined With the method of principle components to build regionally tuned maps of
sediment concentration. Using methods similar to those described by Ortiz, we computed the principle components
based on the ﬁrst-derivative 0f HICO data along the mouth of the Columbia River7’8. Computing the ﬁrst derivative of
sediment rich waters from the Columbia River indicated a correlation weighted around 590 nm (Fig 4). Example
sediment maps using principle components are shown in Fig. 5. Since the maps are weighted toward the sediment—laden
background waters, they naturally highlight objects With different reﬂectance on this background, such as boats as
shown in Fig. 6.

coast of the United States and the largest wetland habitat in the western US. It is a critical ecosystem that links
freshwater and marine environments providing essential habitat for ﬁsh, drinking water to over 22 million urban users,
and irrigation water for agriculture in the highly productive Central Valley. HICO imagery provides a fresh insight into
this complex system and here we examine the water exiting the bay.
Fig. 7 shows an example of a phase difference function for water masses that appear inside and outside of the edge of
what appears to be the bay water and sea water mixing interface. The red pixels in Fig. 7 c highlight areas that contain a
jump in the phase difference centered at 709 nm, revealing patches of presumably high algal concentrations that eXist at
the interface of the bay and sea waters. This bloom could be a result of large amounts of nutrients, particularly ammonia
from sewage plants, that are released in the Sacramento River and San Francisco Bay system but not utilized in the Bay.

4. DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSIONS
The use of derivative data, in addition to the original spectral radiances is helpful since it can highlight signiﬁcant
features. This observation has been used often in the past for identiﬁcation of laboratory spectra, and it is possible to
directly adapt laboratory identiﬁcation methods, such as derivative spectroscopy, to remote sensing product estimation.
Derivative spectroscopy has previously been used to identify optimal spectral channels for the design of multi-spectral
instruments21 and to estimate coastal bottom types from aerial hyperspectral data4. Here we illustrate the use of methods
adapted from derivative spectroscopy for product generation from HICO data. The detection of these underlying
absorptive and ﬂuorescent signatures can be sharpened by the use of derivative spectroscopy. Speciﬁcally, peaks with
narrower half-widths grow more quickly with the order of the derivative. This is illustrated in Fig. 5 where we show that
the derivative helps to highlight signatures sensitive to sediment in Columbia River spectra. Spectral features identiﬁed
in this way can create products which are ‘regionally tuned,’ and built on historical data speciﬁc to a coastal area. Our
method for deriving sediment and pigment products from HICO is similar to that recently described by Gitelson, et allg.
They used HICO data to create a regionally tuned chlorophyll-a product for the Azov Sea. They pick the bands for the
product and then optimize the choice of bands for a band-ratio algorithm based on in Situ data. Their method is also
informed by derivative analysis in their choice of the ﬁnal bands for the regression. Our method differs in that we build
our optimization using all the HICO wavelengths, and instead of testing for the sensitivity to speciﬁc bands, our

"7","sensitivity is based on the principal components which are a linear combination of all the wavelengths. Speciﬁcally, the

method we describe could contain details about the spectral shape - such as spectral bandwidths - which might not be

utilized in the method of Gitelson and eo-workers.

All of these results highlight the advantages of hyperspeetral imaging. Future NASA ocean color sensors including

PACE, GEO-CAPE and HyspIRI are all planned to be hyperspeetral sensors with 5 11m spectral sampling or better,

similar to HICO. HICO’s 93 m spatial resolution is excellent for sampling the coastal ocean. However, HICO samples

selected targets only, and an instrument designed to sample the entire coastal ocean should have a coarser resolution to
maximize area coverage. Earlier studies22’23 indicated that 300 to 500 111 resolution was adequate for most coastal

regions when the bottom is not imaged. This was recently conﬁrmed by Aurin, et al.24 who found that a pixel size of 520

m or smaller was needed to sample large river plumes and other coastal features. Based on these results we strongly

urge that the PACE sensor have a coastal mode with 500 m or better sampling. The threshold science requirements for

GEO-CAPE require a 375 111 pixel size at nadir which translates to approximately 500 m in U.S. coastal waters for this

geostationary sensor located over the Equator. The preferred baseline requirement is 250 m which would provide

approximately 300 111 resolution for U.S. coastal waters. HyspIRI is primarily a land imager but will provide 60 111 pixel
size data valuable for coastal areas particularly when the bottom is imaged resulting in a much more spatially complex
scene.
