Abstract—The 3D structure of recombinant bacterial carboxypeptidase T (CPT) in complex with N—BOC—L—leueine was
determined at 1.38 A resolution. Crystals for the X—ray study were grown in microgravity using the counter—diffusion tech—
nique. N—BOC—L—leueine and 803‘ ion bound in the enzyme active site were localized in the electron density map.
Location of the leucine side chain in CPT—N—BOC—L—leueine complex allowed identiﬁcation of the SI subsite 0f the
enzyme, and its structure was determined. Superposition of the structures of CPT—N—BOC—L—leueine complex and com—
plexes of pancreatic carboxypeptidases A and B with substrate and inhibitors was carried out, and similarity of the 81 sub—
sites in these three carboxypeptidases was revealed. It was found that 803‘ ion occupies the same position in the 81’ subsite
as the C—terminal carboxy group of the substrate.

Fig. 6. Superposition of the structures of complexes CPT—N—BOC—L—leucine and CPA—potato inhibitor (stereo View). N—BOC—L—leucine
and the 802‘ ion in CPT are shown in gray; three C—terminaloresidues of potato inhibitor (P1036, Tyr37, and Val38) are shown in black; the
environment of these ligands is shown within the radius 4.5 A. Amino acid residues are numerated as in CPT. The numbers of amino acid
residues that differ in the two proteins are shown in italic and light—gray. The side chains in the Si subsite are shown on a gray background.
The zinc ion is shown by a sphere of large radius and water molecules by spheres of smaller radii.
