[1] Observations of airglow emission using the RAIDS (Remote Atmospheric
and Ionospheric Detection System) instruments on the International Space Station Kibo
module are reported and compared to a photochemical model of the emission process.
Launched in Sept. 2009, RAIDS performed routine observations of the 02(b12 —> X32)
Atmospheric band (02 A-band) transition during solar minimum conditions from October
2009 to December 2010. Limb brightness of the (0,0), (0,1) and (1,1) Vibration band
emissions were measured in the altitude range 80 to 180 km with the Near Infrared
Spectrometer (NIRS) instrument, one of eight limb Viewing instruments in the RAIDS
experiment. Comparison of observed brightness proﬁles with the model shows very good
agreement for the (0,0) and (0,1) bands. The model underestimates the (1,1) brightness
proﬁles throughout the region, especially near the peak. Reasonable variations
of composition and selected rate constants do not account for the underestimation
of (1,1) band brightness. A contributing factor could be in the assumption of detailed
balance and the accepted energy transfer pathways that redistribute energy between
the V = 0 and V = 1 states.
