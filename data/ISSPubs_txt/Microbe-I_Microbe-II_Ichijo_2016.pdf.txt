Studies on the relationships between humans and microbes in space habitation environments are critical for success in long—
duration space missions, to reduce potential hazards to the crew and the spacecraft infrastructure. We performed microbial
monitoring in the Japanese Experiment Module ”Kibo”, a part of the International Space Station, for 4 years after its completion, and
analyzed samples with modern molecular microbiological techniques. Sampling was performed in September 2009, February 2011,
and October 2012. The surface of the incubator, inside the door of the incubator, an air intake, air diffuser, and handrail were
selected as sampling sites. Sampling was performed using the optimized swabbing method. Abundance and phylogenetic
afﬁliation of bacteria on the interior surfaces of Kibo were determined by quantitative PCR and pyrosequencing, respectively.
Bacteria in the phyla Proteobacteria (v—subclass) and Firmicutes were frequently detected on the interior surfaces in Kibo. Families
Staphylococcaceae and Enterobacteriaceae were dominant. Most bacteria detected belonged to the human microbiota; thus, we
suggest that bacterial cells are transferred to the surfaces in Kibo from the astronauts. Environmental bacteria such as Legionella
spp. were also detected. From the data on bacterial abundance and phylogenetic afﬁliation, Kibo has been microbiologically well
maintained; however, the microbial community structure in Kibo may change with prolonged stay of astronauts. Continuous
monitoring is required to obtain information on changes in the microbial community structure in Kibo.
