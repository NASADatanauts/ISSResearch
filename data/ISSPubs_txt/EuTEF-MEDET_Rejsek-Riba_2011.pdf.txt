Material Exposure and Degradation Experiment is an active material experiment exposed to the low-Earth-orbit
environment for 18 months onboard ISS/Columbus. This paper focuses on the results of Spectrometer experiment,
one of the seven subunits of MEDET. The purpose of this experiment is to measure in real time thermooptical
properties of a large set of materials designed for space applications (20 different materials). Some of these materials
have been developed for atomic oxygen-resistant protection for low-Earth-orbit spacecraft applications. The
evolution of their thermooptical properties on the International Space Station orbit allows for monitoring
the degradation of materials mainly due to ultraviolet and atomic oxygen before recovery phenomena take place at
the time the experiment returns into the atmosphere. Ultraviolet-visible transmission spectra from preliminary ﬂight
data highlight the two degradation phenomena expected for such a mission, namely: yellowing for atomic oxygen
protected polymeric ﬁlms and silicone resins due to ultraviolet exposure, and the decrease of thicknesses for other
samples like polymeric ﬁlms due to atomic oxygen erosion.
