Abstract
In the GENEX (GENe EXpression) spaceﬂight experiment (ﬂown on STS—87), siX surface sterilized soybean seeds (Glycine max
CV McCall) were inserted into each of 32 autoclaved plastic seed growth pouches containing an inner germination paper sleeve (for a
total of 192 seeds). The pouches were stowed within a mid—deck locker until Mission Flight Day 10, at which time an astronaut
added water to initiate the process of seed germination on—orbit and subsequently transferred them to four 1ight—tight aluminum
canisters called BRIC—60s (Biological Research In Canisters). We report here on the morphological Characteristics of: (1) the recov—
ered ﬂight plants (N = 177), (2) the corresponding ground control population (N = 183), plus (3) additional controls grown on the
ground under clinostat conditions (N = 93). No signiﬁcant morphological differences were found between the ﬂight, ground control
and clinorotated treatments for either the cotyledons 0r hypocotyls. There were, however, signiﬁcantly longer primary roots pro-
duced in the ﬂight population relative to the ground control population, which in turn had signiﬁcantly longer primary roots than
the Clinorotated population. This same pattern was observed relative to the production of lateral roots (ﬂight > control > Clinoro—
tated). Taken together with previous literature reports, we believe that there is now suﬂicient evidence to conclude that plants grown
under conditions of microgravity will generally exhibit enhanced root production relative to their ground control counterparts.
Some causes underlying this phenomenon are speculated 0n.
