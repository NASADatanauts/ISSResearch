Bone loss, a key concern for long-duration space travelers, is typically considered a female issue. The number of
women who have ﬂown long-duration space missions is now great enough to allow a quantitative comparison of
changes in bone and renal stone risk by sex. Participants were 42 astronauts 0n long-duration missions to the
International Space Station, 33 men and 9 women. Bone mineral density (by dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry)
and biochemical markers of bone metabolism (from blood and urine samples) were evaluated before and after
ﬂight. Data were analyzed in two groups, based on available resistance exercise equipment. Missions were 49-215
days in duration, ﬂown between 2000 and 2012. The bone density response to spaceﬂight was the same for men
and women in both exercise groups. The bone mineral density response to ﬂight was the same for men and women,
and the typical decrease in bone mineral density (whole body and/or regional) after ﬂight was not observed for
either sex for those using an advanced resistive exercise device. Biochemical markers of bone formation and
resorption responded similarly in male and female astronauts. The response of urinary supersaturation risk to
spaceﬂight was not signiﬁcantly different between men and women, although risks were typically increased after
ﬂight in both groups, and risks were greater in men than in women before and after ﬂight. The responses of men
and women to spaceﬂight with respect to these measures of bone health were not different.

"3","Introduction
In the 30 years since Sally Ride’s inaugural spaceﬂight for American women, questions have been raised about sex
differences in the responses to all aspects of spaceﬂight. Given that bone loss is one of the physiological concerns
for astronauts, and sex differences occur in the incidence of bone diseases (e.g., osteoporosis) on Earth, Whether
such differences exist in bone loss in space was an obvious area of inquiry and concern. Until recently, no study of
sex differences in bone response to spaceﬂight has been possible.
Progress has recently been made in mitigating loss of bone mineral 0n long-duration space missions, either With
exercise and nutriti0n(1) or with pharmaceuticals.(2) Heavy resistance exercise in well-nourished crews With
adequate energy intakes and adequate Vitamin D status has allowed maintenance of bone mineral density (BMD)
after 4- t0 6-month1nternati0nal Space Station (188) missions.(1) This came as a result of bone remodeling, and
not a simple suppression of bone resorption elevated by spaceﬂight.
Bone demineralization during spaceﬂight leads to an increased risk of forming kidney stones, starting in the ﬁrst
days of ﬂight and continuing until after landing.(3-5) On 1- t0 2-week Space Shuttle ﬂights, as on Earth, urine
biochemistry indicates that men have a greater risk for stone formation than women, but both have an increased
supersaturation risk relative to before ﬂight.(5,6) However, the postﬂight increase for men puts them above the
typical supersaturation threshold, Whereas women show no greater risk than the general p0pu1ati0n.(6)
We tested the hypothesis that the rate of bone loss was not different between men and women during spaceﬂight
for two different exercise protocols. We report here the ﬁrst assessment of sex differences in bone and renal stone
risks in response to spaceﬂight.

"4","Methods
The study was reviewed and approved by the NASA J ohnson Space Center Institutional Review Board (IRB), and
all protocols complied with the World Medical Association Declaration of Helsinki — Ethical Principles for
Medical Research Involving Human Subj ects. Written informed consent was obtained from crew members before
they participated.
Participants
Data from 42 astronauts on 188 expeditions 1-32 (missions of 49-215 days duration, ﬂown between 2000 and
2012) were combined and analyzed in one of two data sets based on exercise equipment available during the
participants’ missions. Crew members who launched before 11/ 14/2008 had access to the interim resistive exercise
device (iRED), and crew members who launched on or after 11/14/2008 had access to the advanced resistive
exercise device (ARED). Data from some of these 42 crew members have been previously reported (1,2,7-10) but
never with respect to the seX-speciﬂc effects. Subject demographics are shown in Supplemental Data Table 1.
Astronauts were excluded from this analysis if they were participating in an evaluation of bisphosphonates as a
bone-loss countermeasure.(2) Participants in another study, in which potassium citrate was used to mitigate renal
stone risk, were not excluded after ﬁndings with and without them were evaluated, and no differences in any
overarching effects or conclusions were found. The means, SD, and statistical results presented include the 9 crew
members supplemented with potassium citrate in the iRED group. When 3 men and 2 women each ﬂew on 2
missions, each ﬂight was treated as a unique event. All but one of the female astronauts were believed to have been
pre-menopausal at the time of their mission; however, we do not have data pertaining to menstrual cycle regularity
and/or surgical status for the others. Additionally, most female astronauts suppress menstrual cycles
pharmacologically during ﬂight.

"
"5","Dietary intake during ﬂight was determined using a Food Frequency Questionnaire, as previously reported.(11,12)
Sample Collection and Biochemical Analyses
Fasting blood samples and two 24-h urine samples were collected 10 to 131 days (average was 69 d: 24) before
ﬂight and again on landing day, 0 t0 2 days after ﬂight. Blood and urine samples were analyzed for indices of bone
and calcium metabolism and Vitamin D status, and have been previously described.(13-17). Full details are
provided in the Supplemental Data ﬂle.
Bone Densitometry
As previously described,(11,15,18) area1 bone mineral density (BMD) was determined once before (129 d: 90 days,
range 31-454) and once after (12 d: 9 days, range 6-46 days) spaceﬂight by DXA with a fan-beam densitometer
(Hologic Discovery; Hologic, Inc., Waltham, MA, USA). Full details are provided in the Supplemental Data ﬁle.
Statistical Analysis
All statistical analyses were performed using Stata 1C software (V 12.1, StataCorp, College Station, TX, USA) and
setting 2-tai1ed Ct to reject the null hypothesis at 0.05. Continuous linear comparisons were made using duration of
spaceﬂight and a preﬂight sample. A11 dependent variables were assessed multiple times, resulting in a longitudinal
(repeated measures) experimental design. Full details are provided in the Supplemental Data ﬁle.
Results
The bone mineral density response to ﬂight was the same for men and women, and the typical decrease in bone
mineral density (whole-body and/or regional) after ﬂight was not observed for either sex for those using the current
exercise program (i.e., ARED). Before spaceﬂight, total body and pelvis bone mineral densities were greater for
men than women (Table 1). Early exercise protocols (iRED) failed to protect bone, with both men and women

5

"
"6","haVing lost total-body and pelvis bone mineral density. These losses were not observed in those using current
exercise protocols (i.e., ARED), in either whole-body or regional bone density determinations.
While it appears in Table 1 that the shorter duration missions had more bone loss, this was not documented
statistically, and most likely is an artifact of the data presentation method. It is important to remember, as
mentioned in the “Statistical Analysis” section, the data were analyzed using actual mission durations in a
continuous linear model. However, we cannot present these data in that fashion, in part because of concerns about
subj ect conﬁdentiality, given that mission durations are often attributable to only 1 astronaut. Thus, data are
presented in 2 ways, normalized to percentage change per month of spaceﬂight (Figure 1, bone mineral density;
Supplemental Figure 1, bone mineral content), and categorized into 2 groups, missions of longer or shorter
duration than 150 days of spaceﬂight (Table 2 and Supplemental Data Table 2).
Some have hypothesized that it might be better to ﬂy astronauts who have larger, more dense bones before ﬂight
because they have a larger amount of bone to begin with, and in theory would thus remain above the fracture risk
threshold despite any losses. This implies, perhaps unintentionally, that men are better suited for spaceﬂight
because they typically (and as observed here) start out with greater bone mineral content (Supplemental Data Table
2) and bone mineral density. As the bone-loss effect of spaceﬂight on men and women is the same, we investigated
this hypothesis further by combining all data (male, female, iRED, and ARED) and examined whether preﬂight
BMC was correlated with percentage bone loss. We found that the percentage change in BMC after ﬂight was
inversely correlated with preﬂight BMC. As Figure 3A shows, crew members with a greater initial BMC (mostly
men) lost a larger percentage of bone during ﬂight (p 0.0179, r 0.3638). When percentage BMC loss was
normalized to months of ﬂight duration (Figure 2B), the correlation still suggested a trend (p 0.0724, r 0.2692) in
this response. Therefore crew members with greater BMC lose more bone (%) and lose it faster (%/ ﬂight duration),
independent of sex and exercise. This goes against conventional wisdom, as outlined above, because crew
members who started with more BMC end up losing more bone faster than crew members who started with less
BMC.

"7","Body composition responses to spaceﬂight were inﬂuenced by the exercise equipment available, but were not
inﬂuenced by sex. As expected, body mass (Supplemental Data Table 3 and Supplemental Figure 2) was greater
for men than for women, with greater changes in iRED than ARED groups. In the iRED group, body composition
(% lean, % fat) did not change (Supplemental Data Table 3 and Supplemental Figure 2). For crew members
exercising 0n the ARED had less body fat (mass and %) after ﬂight, and tended to have more lean tissue (mass and
%). Thus, the current exercise protocol is literally bringing crew members home in better general physical shape
than when they launched. Given decades of evidence for muscle atrophy and bone loss in astronauts, the changes
observed with the current exercise regimen are very encouraging.
There was an interactive effect of sex and ﬂight duration on the bone formation marker bone-speciﬂc alkaline
phosphatase (BSAP) in crewmembers using the iRED. Speciﬁcally, BSAP was increased in male astronauts but
not female astronauts in this group upon landing (Table 2). For astronauts using the ARED, BSAP increased with
ﬂight duration (p 0.001) and was higher in men than women (p 0.01). Osteocalcin, an index of bone turnover, was
unaffected by sex and by spaceﬂight (Supplemental Data Table 4). Bone resorption, evaluated using urinary
collagen crosslinks, responded similarly in male and female astronauts (Table 2 and Supplemental Data Table 4).
Although some differences between men and women existed in bone resorption markers (Table 2 and
Supplemental Data Table 4), these differences were less or were not apparent when data were normalized to
creatinine (an index of muscle mass) (Supplemental Data Table 5) or to preﬂight whole-body bone mass (data not
presented).
The Vitamin D intake of ARED crew members was observed to be greater than the Vitamin D intake of iRED crew
members (Supplemental Data Table 6). The serum 25-hydr0xyvitamin D data reﬂect this increase (Table 2).

7

"
"8","A common technique for assessing renal stone risk includes estimating supersaturation of stone-forming
compounds in urine and provides an overview of the urine chemistry from a 24-h urine collection.(17) With one
exception (uric acid supersaturation), there was no signiﬁcant difference between the response of men and women
in estimated supersaturation risk after spaceﬂight, although supersaturation for other stone types was typically
increased after ﬂight in both groups, and was greater in men than in women before and after ﬂight (Table 3 and
Supplemental Data Table 4). Most analytes were excreted in greater amounts by men than by women (Table 3 and
Supplemental Data Table 4), and these differences tended to disappear when the data were normalized to creatinine
(data not shown). Urinary calcium excretion was greater in men than women before ﬂight, and there was little
change after ﬂight for either exercise group. Other markers related to stone formation risk were different between
the 2 sexes in each exercise group and between the 2 sexes (Table 3 and Supplemental Data Table 4). Some of
these differences are likely related to dietary intake differences between groups, and to the changes in typical
intake that occur soon after landing.
Discussion
The response of bone to spaceﬂight was the same for men and women in both exercise groups. Men and women
lost proportional amounts of bone under the early exercise protocol (iRED), but the current exercise protocol
(ARED) protected against loss of bone mineral density in men and women equally. The ARED exercise group did
not lose bone (in the whole body or speciﬁc regions), but they gained lean mass and lost fat mass during ﬂight
whereas the iRED group lost bone and lean mass, and gained fat mass.
These ﬁndings are consistent with previously published results for subsets of these groups,(1,10) and moreover, the
varying responses of both men and women support earlier conclusions, that early exercise protocols (with iRED)
were insufﬁcient to protect bone,(10) and that the current 188 exercise program (with ARED) is making signiﬁcant
strides toward improving the bone health of astronauts, regardless of sex, during spaceﬂight.(1) It is worth noting
that this is the third paper reporting DXA data from 188 crews that had access to the ARED (although sex was not
addressed in other papers). We report here data from 6 more crew members than the second paper,(2) and 9 more

8

"
"9","than the ﬂrst.(1) Furthermore, we replicated statistical analyses here with the subset of crew members from the
second paper,(2) and found no difference in results or conclusions.
The responses of biochemical markers of bone metabolism were similar in men and women. Bone formation, as
assessed by BSAP, is typically unchanged during ﬂight,(14,20) with a recently documented exception being
astronauts performing heavy resistance exercise during ﬂight.(1) A rapid increase occurs post ﬂight as the body
begins to readapt t0 1g.(11) Similar to previous spaceﬂight studies,(1,11,14,20-24) bone resorption was increased
after spaceﬂight, regardless of exercise type.
Vitamin D is an important hormone for bone and calcium metabolism, and Vitamin D deﬁciency is of concern for
astronauts because their food sources of Vitamin D are limited and they lack ultraviolet light exposure in the
shielded spacecraft.(1) As a result, Vitamin D supplements have been provided to all 188 crews. In 2007, the
provision doubled from 400 IU/d to 800 IU/d, starting around the time the ARED was deployed on 188 (in 2008).
It is noteworthy that in these individuals, with no exposure to ultraviolet light and a food system with limited
Vitamin D sources, intake of 700-800 IU vitamin D/d maintains circulating Vitamin D levels above Institute of
Medicine recommendations for bone health and close to what many consider to be “optimal” levels (e.g., 75-80
nmol/L, 30-32 ng/InL).(25)
Spaceﬂight is associated with an increased risk of renal stone formation, largely because of the increased calcium
excretion secondary to bone 10ss.(3,26,27) The effects of spaceﬂight on renal stone risk documented here are
consistent with earlier publications, where sex comparisons were not p0ssib1e.(26,27) We document here, however,
that the response to spaceﬂight is the same in men and women. For sodium urate stones, the average
supersaturation risk for astronauts before ﬂight exceeded that for the general population, for both men and women.
The risk of forming calcium oxalate stones increased after ﬂight for both men and women in both the iRED and
ARED groups. These data highlight the criticality of increased ﬂuid consumption even after ﬂight.

"
"10","In summary, this study provides the ﬁrst detailed analysis of sex differences in bone and renal stone effects of
spaceﬂight. The data document that, although on Earth sex differences exist in bone mineral density and content,
and in renal stone risk, the effects of spaceﬂight seem to be nondiscriminatory in this regard. Furthermore, the data
reported here document the relative success of the current spaceﬂight exercise regimen. Although work remains to
be done, to answer further questions, the progress noted here and in recent reports is extremely encouraging.
