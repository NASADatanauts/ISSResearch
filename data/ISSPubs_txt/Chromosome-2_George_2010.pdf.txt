seen for all astronauts and the yield of chromosome damage in some individuals actually increased with
time after ﬂight. The decreasing trend in total exchanges was slightly more signiﬁcant when statistical
analysis was restricted to data collected more than 220 days after return from ﬂight. When analysis
was restricted to data collected within 220 days of return from the mission there was no relationship
between total exchanges and time. Translocation yields varied more between astronauts and there was
only a slight non—signiﬁcant decrease with time after ﬂight that was similar for both later and earlier
sampling times.

1. Introduction may decline with time after irradiation, at least for space radiation
exposures [6,7]. Durante et al. [7] analyzed chromosome damage

During spaceﬂight, astronauts are exposed to very penetrating in Russian cosmonauts and reported a lack of correlation between
radiation consisting primarily of high—energy protons and heavy time in space or absorbed dose and translocation yields, although
