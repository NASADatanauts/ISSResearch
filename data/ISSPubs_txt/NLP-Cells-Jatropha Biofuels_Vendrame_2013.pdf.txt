Abstract
J atropha (Jatropha curcas) is a tropical perennial species identiﬁed as a potential biofuel crop. The oil is of excellent quality and it has
been successfully tested as biodiesel and in jet fuel mixes. However, studies on breeding and genetic improvement ofjatropha are limited.
Space offers a unique environment for experiments aiming at the assessment of mutations and differential gene expression of crops and
in vitro cultures of plants are convenient for studies of genetic variation as affected by microgravity. However, before microgravity studies
can be successfully performed, pre—ﬂight experiments are necessary to characterize plant material and validate ﬂight hardware environ—
mental conditions. Such preliminary studies set the ground for subsequent spaceﬂight experiments. The objectives of this study were to
compare the in vitro growth of cultures from three explant sources (cotyledon, leaf, and stem sections) of three jatropha accessions (Bra—
zil, India, and Tanzania) outside and inside the petriGAP, a modiﬁed group activation pack (GAP) ﬂight hardware to ﬁt petri dishes. In
vitro jatropha cell cultures were established in petri dishes containing a modiﬁed MS medium and maintained in a plant growth chamber
at 25 :l: 2 0C in the dark. Parameters evaluated were surface area of the explant tissue (A), fresh weight (FW), and dry weight (DW) for a
period of 12 weeks. Growth was observed for cultures from all accessions at week 12, including subsequent plantlet regeneration. For all
accessions differences in A, FW and DW were observed for inside vs. outside the PetriGAPs. Growth parameters were affected by acces—
sion (genotype), explant type, and environment. The type of explant inﬂuenced the type of cell growth and subsequent plantlet regen—
eration capacity. However, overall cell growth showed no abnormalities. The present study demonstrated that jatropha in vitro cell
cultures are suitable for growth inside PetriGAPs for a period of 12 weeks. The parameters evaluated in this study provide the basic
ground work and pre—ﬂight assessment needed to justify a model for microgravity studies with jatropha in vitro cell cultures. Future stud—
ies should focus on results of experiments performed with jatropha in vitro cultures in microgravity.
