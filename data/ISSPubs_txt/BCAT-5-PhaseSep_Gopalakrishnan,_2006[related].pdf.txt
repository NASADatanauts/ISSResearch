Abstract
Weak depletion gels with particle radii of ~200—500 nm have been reported to
display a time—dependent settling behaviour where an initially space spanning
gel displays a catastrophic collapse after a characteristic period of time, deﬁned
as the delay time. Several experiments suggest that thermally activated particle
rearrangements promote macroscopic gel coarsening, which ultimately triggers
the rapid collapse. The delay time is found to be a sensitive function of
the colloid volume fraction and polymer concentration. We have performed
systematic experiments on the silica—decalin—polystyrene depletion system to
explore how colloid volume fraction, polymer concentration, particle radius
and ratio of polymer radius of gyration to particle radius inﬂuence the delayed
collapse time of transient gels. We employ a recently developed activated
barrier—hopping theory to make predictions of the timescales over which colloids
can escape localized states as a function of system parameters. Our study
shows that, within experimental uncertainty, delay times follow an exponential
dependence on a composite variable that is a function of the three controllable
system variables, which is very similar to that predicted for the thermally
activated local rearrangement timescales. This provides support for the
hypothesis that thermally activated particle motions are a rate—limiting step in
determining the timescale for the initiation of catastrophic collapse of transient
gels. In addition, the model explains why transient gel formation is found to be
absent in weak depletion gels as particle sizes are reduced.

interactions modulated by volume—exclusion—driven crowding effects. The resulting slow
diffusion leads to long relaxation times and solid—like elastic behaviour [2]. Material properties
can be controlled by system parameters such as the range and strength of inter—particle
attractions, colloid sizes and volume fraction, solvent dielectric properties and external forces.

One method of triggering particle aggregation that has seen extensive study involves the
addition of non—adsorbing polymer that induces an attractive depletion force of entropic origin
between colloids [3]. Aggregation occurs when the depletion attraction overwhelms the random
thermal forces that drive long range diffusion. The strength and range of the depletion attraction
is controlled by the concentration and molecular weight (or radius of gyration) of the polymeric
additives. While a variety of phase transformations are observed in depletion systems, here
we are interested in the formation of gels that readily occur when the ratio of the polymer
radius of gyration, Rg, relative to the particle radius, R, is less than ~O.1. A signiﬁcant
degree of success has been recently achieved in understanding how depletion interactions alter
the suspension microstructure under equilibrium conditions and the mechanical responses of
these suspensions [4—11]. At the gel point, dense percolating clusters are formed and the
microstructure and mechanical properties of the suspensions have been determined in the linear
Viscoelastic regime [3, 9].

Most studies have focused on regimes in which particles are sufﬁciently strongly localized
that the material properties are essentially time invariant on experimental timescales. However,
a number of systems eXist whose properties are determined by their age in addition to other
parameters. Thixotropic suspensions are the most often observed class of materials with time—
dependent properties [1]. From an industrial perspective, understanding how sample age affects
properties is critical to determining the durability or shelf—life of products.

An interesting example of time—dependent behaviour has been reported by Poon and co—
workers [12], where a form of delayed settling is observed in weakly aggregated depletion
gels, deﬁned as ‘transient gels’. In these systems, upon preparation, the gels form a structure
that is space ﬁlling. However, after a characteristic period of time, deﬁned as the delay time,
the gel catastrophically collapses, resulting in a consolidated sediment at the bottom of the
Vial. Delay times are reported to increase strongly with increasing polymer concentration and
colloid volume fraction. Delayed settling is associated with the network losing its ability to
sustain gravitational stresses after a period of time. Direct observation of the gel with dark
ﬁeld imaging techniques [12] reveals that at about the time of collapse ‘streamers’ and large
scale ﬁssures appear, that facilitate the up—ﬁow of the solvent, thereby accelerating gel collapse.
These observations make it apparent that transient gels are subject to a variety of restructuring
mechanisms that are potentially governed by a number of parameters. Interestingly, delayed
settling has also been reported in several other colloidal systems [13—16], suggesting that
a common underlying physics may govern the various processes that eventually trigger gel
collapse.

Since particles experience relatively weak attractions in transient gels, thermal ﬂuctuations
are capable of breaking the ‘physical bonds’, providing opportunities for particles to ‘de—
localize’ and re—arrange their positions on experimentally accessible timescales. Confocal
microscopy experiments [13] have provided Visual evidence of random bond breakage in
transient gels. Similar evidence has been found in simulations of high volume fraction
particle gels [17]. Dynamic light—scattering (DLS) experiments [18, 19], which probe delay
times up to ~1O3—104 s, report a long time exponential decay in the correlation function,
suggesting that particles diffuse out of localized states given a sufﬁcient amount of time. Thus,
thermal ﬂuctuations provide a mechanism by which particles rearrange their positions, leading,
over time, to macroscopic structural changes and ultimately a collapse of the gel network.
Poon and co—workers [12] discuss possible mechanisms by which these thermally activated

rearrangements can result in a more compact arrangement of particles. These rearrangements
would result in the opening up of larger void spaces and therefore increased gel permeability
for settling. The resulting faster solvent up—ﬁow would then be expected to enhance bond—
breakage rates, thereby accelerating gel breakup and coarsening the gel structure. Ultimately,
the gel is weakened to a point that it is unable to support its own weight and this ﬁnally leads
to catastrophic gel collapse.

Here we pursue a quantitative test of the idea that thermal—ﬁuctuation—induced bond
breakage and single particle activated hopping is the rate—limiting step in determining the
delay time for gel collapse. A systematic study of how the colloid volume fraction, gb,
polymer concentration, polymer radius of gyration, Rg, and particle size, R, inﬂuence the
experimental delay times is performed. The recently proposed barrier—hopping theory [20]
incorporates activated dynamics in a manner that builds on the naive mode—coupling theory
(NMCT) [11, 21], which is a simpliﬁed version of the ideal mode—coupling theory (MCT) [22].
This theory makes predictions for single particle ‘de—localization’ times in structurally
arrested systems [20, 23] and gel boundaries [11], which have been shown to accurately
capture experimental observations of both particle localization (gel formation) and mechanical
properties (elastic modulus in the linear Viscoelastic regime). Using a non—equilibrium free
energy construct to describe the resistance associated with inter—particle depletion attractions
to long time diffusion, the theory can predict barrier hopping or ergodicity restoring timescales
in depletion gels [23]. As demonstrated in the following sections, experimentally observed
delay times for macroscopic gel collapse display a roughly universal behaviour, that is similar
to the predictions of single particle hopping times. This lends support to the hypothesis that
elementary bond—breakage events are the rate—limiting steps that trigger gel collapse.

A brief review of the activated barrier—hopping theory is given in section 2. In section 3,
we discuss the experimental techniques employed in the study. Section 4 presents our
experimental ﬁndings, where we ﬁnd that, in addition to the volume fraction and polymer
concentration [12, 13], delay times are also dependent on the particle size and the ratio Rg/R.
To fully understand these observations the inﬂuence of weak residual attractions arising from a
small mismatch in the refractive indices of the solvent and colloid is discussed. In section 5, we
demonstrate that for a given particle size delay times follow a polymer concentration, volume
fraction and polymer radius of gyration scaling as predicted by the activated barrier—hopping
theory for single particle de—localization events [23]. In addition, particles of different sizes are
found to fall into different ‘classes’ due to the inﬂuence of gravitational stresses on the delayed
collapse phenomenon. Section 6 presents the conclusions.

2. Activated barrier-hopping theory
In this section we brieﬂy review the NMCT and activated hopping theories for spherical
particle suspensions. All technical details have been given in exhaustive detail in prior
publications [11, 20, 23, 24]. The dynamic order parameter is the scalar displacement of a
colloid from its initial position, r(t), which obeys a closed non—linear stochastic Langevin
equation of motion that in the overdamped limit is given by [20, 24]

quantity is the nonequilibrium or effective free energy, F (r (1)), which quantiﬁes within a
local equilibrium, dynamic density functional framework the effect of surrounding particles
on the tagged particle dynamics [24]. It can be explicitly expressed in terms of r(l) and
the colloid equilibrium collective structure factor [20, 24] computable from the polymer
reference interaction site model (PRISM) theory for polymer—particle suspensions. The PRISM
theory [25] has been shown to accurately predict the colloidal structure factors of well
characterized silica—decalin—polystyrene suspensions under equilibrium conditions [10]. This
allows quantitative, no—adjustable—parameter dynamical predictions to be made for colloid—
polymer suspensions at both the ideal MCT and the activated barrier—hopping theory levels.
Solution of equation (1) in the absence of noise yields the NMCT self—consistent equation for
the long time limit of the particle displacement or localization length [11, 21]. The system
conditions (colloid volume fraction, polymer concentration etc) that signal the ﬁrst localized
solution deﬁne the ideal gel transition. The zero—frequency elastic shear modulus G’ can be
immediately computed from the standard Green—Kubo formula [4, 8, 11].

Within the activated barrier—hopping theory [20, 24], the ideal MCT non—ergodicity
transition signals a qualitative change in the nonequilibrium free energy to a form that involves
a localization well and a barrier (as illustrated in ﬁgure 1), and thus a crossover to activated
dynamics. The mean ﬁrst passage, or barrier—hopping time, ‘L'Hop, can be computed from the
high friction overdamped (diffusive barrier crossing) version of Kramers’ theory [26]

KobeleV and Schweizer have extended the above theory to treat the effect of external
stress in colloidal glasses and gels [27—29]. When an external mechanical force is applied
to a suspension, it distorts the effective free energy and reduces the barrier which leads to

modulus softening, enhanced delocalization and a reduced barrier—hopping time. Speciﬁcally, a
constant applied stress is modelled as inducing a constant force f on the tagged particle, which
is proportional to the applied stress times the cross—sectional area of a particle [27]. The concept
is illustrated in the inset plot of ﬁgure 1, and the details of the numerical implementation are
given in [27—29].

3. Experimental methods

3.]. Particle synthesis

The Stober method [30] is employed to synthesize silica particles of a certain seed size. As per
the technique, the base—cata1ysed hydrolysis of tetraethy1 ortho—silicate (TEOS) is performed
in an ethanol medium following a set recipe to obtain the desired seed size. Using the
‘double—addition’ process developed by Bogush and Zukoski [31], the silica seed particles are
then grown to the ﬁnal desired size. For the present study two distinct particle sizes were
synthesized, 188 and 275 nm in radius. The ﬁnal sizes are conﬁrmed by scanning electron
microscopy measurements. The 188 nm particles have a polydispersity of ~5%, and the 275 nm
particles have a polydispersity of ~10%. Once synthesized, the ethanol solvent is boiled off
and the particles are suspended in liquid octadecanol at a temperature of roughly 210 0C for a
period of 6 h. This enables a dense layer of octadecyl chains to be grafted on the surface of the
silica particles, that renders them hydrophobic and soluble in a number of non—polar organic
solvents. As recommended by Van Helden et al [32], the amount of octadecanol used in the
surface grafting technique is around three to ﬁve times the yield of the synthesized particles.
After the grafting process, the mixture of particles and unreacted octadecanol is washed in a
sufﬁcient amount of chloroform and centrifuged to obtain a sedimented cake of the washed
particles. The unreacted octadecanol is discarded in the supernatant. The wash process is
repeated several (three to siX) times to eliminate any traces of the unreacted octadecanol. The
particles are then dried in a vacuum oven for ~24 h to remove traces of the wash solvent.
A particle density value of 1.8 g m1‘1 was used to calculate colloid volume fractions for all
suspensions.

3.2. Sample preparation

For the present study, we examine the effect of four system parameters on the time for the
initiation of rapid collapse of transient gels: polymer concentration, particle radius, R , colloid
volume fraction, gb, and size asymmetry ratio, Rg/R. The solvent used is decalin, which
was purchased from the Sigma Aldrich Company. Due to the near—match of the refractive
indices of decalin and silica, van der Waals attractions are minimized. However, due to the
large particle sizes used in our study, these residual attractions cannot be completely ignored,
and their implications are discussed later. The polymer employed is polystyrene of three
molecular weights (MW)—641 340, 96 900 and 382100 g mol‘l, all of which are purchased
from the Sigma Aldrich Company. Deca1in serves as a near—ideal solvent for polystyrene as
has been characterized by Shah et al [33]. Using their characterization results, the radius of
gyration, Rg, for the above three polymer molecular weights is determined to be 21.1, 8.2 and
16.3 nm respectively. The ﬁrst two molecular weight polymers are utilized with the 275 nm
particles to study the impact of the size asymmetry ratio at constant R, i.e. Rg / R = 0.076
and 0.029, respectively. The third molecular weight polymer is used with the 188 nm particles
corresponding to Rg / R = 0.086, which is nearly equal in magnitude to the Rg / R = 0.076
for the 275 nm particles, and hence is employed to probe the role of particle radius at a nearly

"

constant Rg / R. For both particle radii, the delayed—settling behaviour is studied at two distinct
colloid volume fractions, qb ~ 0.22 and ~0.27.

Samples are prepared by adding requisite amounts of stock colloidal suspension and stock
polymer and the remaining volume is made up by adding decalin to obtain the desired qb
and dimensionless polymer concentration, c/c*, where 6* = 3MW/471Rg‘NA is the overlap
concentration that signiﬁes the transition from the dilute to the semi—dilute region for the
polymer solution and N A is the Avogadro number.

3.3. Measurement procedure

All settling experiments are performed in a cylindrical Vial with a ﬁxed diameter of ~1.2 cm.
The initial sample height for all samples is 2 cm. Prior to starting the experiment, all samples
are vortexed at high speeds to ensure that the sample is well mixed. However, this vorteXing
introduces air bubbles that are observed to have a signiﬁcant inﬂuence on the settling behaviour
of suspensions, similar to that reported in other studies [12, 16]. To eliminate air bubbles,
we employ a gentle vorteXing technique of the sample Vial to force the air bubbles to the
surface so that the suspension bulk is devoid of externally induced inhomogeneities. The gentle
sample shaking is performed for several minutes and kept consistent for all samples. With this
protocol, we are able to reproduce the delay—times to within ~10—20%, an accuracy similar
to that achieved by Poon and co—workers [12] in their studies of the delayed settling response
of poly(methyl methacrylate) (PMMA)—polystyrene—decalin transient depletion gels. After
the gentle shaking, the sample Vial is immediately placed in an enclosed environment so that
convective currents do not disturb the sample while under observation. As time progresses,
the gel begins to sediment and the interface moves towards the bottom of the Vial and a clear
supernatant forms at the top. The interface of the sediment and supernatant deﬁnes the sediment
height and is recorded using a non—intrusive telescopic Viewﬁnder attached to a Vernier scale
with an accuracy of ~0.001 cm.

For all samples discussed here, we observe a transition from a slow settling regime to a
regime where the sample collapses rapidly to form a consolidated cake at the bottom of the
Vial that ﬁnally compacts slowly with time. The initial slow settling is observed over a change
of interface height of only 1—2 mm. This, and other factors, precludes establishing detailed
quantitative trends for the initial sedimentation velocities prior to gel collapse. A typical
example of the settling behaviour is shown in ﬁgure 3 for the 275 nm samples at qb = 0.275
and Rg / R = 0.076. We terminate measurements when samples settle at rates that are slower
than the initial settling rates. The ﬁnal compacted volume fraction, ¢f, is then determined
by multiplying the initial volume fraction, gbo, by the ratio of the initial sample height to the
ﬁnal sample height. We ﬁnd that deﬁning a ﬁnal settling height is only approximate as the
sample continues to settle slowly for long periods of time after the ﬁnal sample height has
been deﬁned. Thus we expect a signiﬁcant amount of uncertainty in the determination of ¢f
in addition to that which arises from reproducibility, and hence restrict ourselves to making
qualitative conclusions from observations of ¢f.

4. Experimental results

Our aim is to understand the effects of increasing polymer concentration for different particle
sizes, volume fractions and radii of gyration on delayed settling times. Shah et al [33]
performed detailed measurements of the gel boundary on a similar experimental system over a
volume fraction range of ~0.10—0.40 for several Rg / R ratios below 0.1, with a particle radius
of 50 nm. The gel boundary was deﬁned as the ﬁrst appearance of a uniform turbid phase.

Figure 2. Initial settling velocity as a function of normalized polymer concentration for samples

composed of 275 nm particles and Rg / R = 0.076. The behaviour of samples of 188 nm particles

is identical.
For volume fractions less than 0.35, gels close to the gel boundary eventually settled to form a
consolidated particle phase leaving behind a particle—free supernatant. At these particle sizes,
it is Visually easy to distinguish the ﬂuid from the gel. However, as particle size increases,
the silica—decalin system becomes more turbid. For the particle sizes used in our study the
suspensions, both polymer free and transient gel systems appear equally turbid t0 the naked
eye and hence the gel boundary cannot be determined by mere Visual inspection.

To determine the location of the gel boundary (deﬁned as cgel at a particular qb),
we investigated the initial settling velocity of the suspensions with increasing polymer
concentration. Figure 2 shows a plot of the initial settling velocities for R = 275 nm and
Rg / R = 0.076 for volume fractions of 0.225 and 0.275. For both volume fractions, an identical
trend is observed. By increasing the amount of polymer in the suspension, the settling velocity
increases. However, above a critical polymer concentration an apparently discontinuous drop
in initial settling velocity occurs with further increases in the polymer concentration, and the
initial settling velocity continues to decrease even though particles are expected to settle more
rapidly with increasing strength of attraction as observed at the lower polymer concentration.
This abrupt decrease in the initial settling rate indicates a transition from an equilibrium ﬂuid
phase to a state where the permeability for the up—ﬂow 0f the solvent dramatically drops and
inter—particle stresses are capable of supporting the gravitational forces acting on the particles.

Several studies [2, 3, 34, 35] on depletion gels demonstrate that the equilibrium ﬂuid phase
and the transient gel state are separated by a region of equilibrium cluster formation where
particles aggregate to form clusters that do not form a percolating network. Recently we have
studied the settling properties of these clusters in dilute suspensions, where we observe that the
settling velocity of the clusters is set only by the colloid volume fraction and is independent
of the polymer concentration. To a ﬁrst approximation, Stokes’ settling velocities for these
clusters suggest their radii are ~50R if we assume clusters of uniform sizes. If the polymer
concentration is ﬁxed and the particle volume fraction is increased, at some point the clusters
percolate and settling is dramatically slowed. As the particle volume fraction is increased, the
range of polymer concentrations where freely settling clusters can be observed narrows. For
suspensions with volume fractions above approximately 0.20 [12], the window for equilibrium
cluster formation is very small and transient gel formation occurs almost immediately above the

equilibrium ﬂuid phase. With further small increase in polymer concentration, transient gels
are no longer observed and the gel remains stable without any evidence of settling for months.
These observations indicate that the dramatic drop in settling velocity seen in ﬁgure 2
is indicative of both cluster formation and percolation to form space—spanning gels. With
increasing polymer concentration, the network strength increases, thereby increasing the net
resistance to settling, and as a result the initial settling velocity decreases. The technique of
ﬁgure 2 has therefore been employed to deﬁne the gel boundary at a given volume fraction
as the mean of the polymer concentration values that demarcate the two initial settling
velocity regimes. The gel boundary polymer concentrations for the different system parameters
employed in the study are listed in table 1.

For the volume fractions and particle sizes in this study, the samples immediately above
the gel boundary display a transient gel—like response, similar to what has been reported
previously [12]. Shah et al [33] did not observe transient gels in their determination of the
gel boundary for gb < 0.35 (however, they do report continued slow settling), although their
silica—based system is identical to ours, with the only difference being that they performed
their experiments on a smaller particle radius of 50 nm. As discussed below, the absence of a
transient gel phase can be attributed to the smaller particle size employed by Shah et al [33].

Figure 4. Initial settling velocity as a function of polymer concentration normalized to the
concentration at the gel boundary for each set of conditions speciﬁed in the ﬁgure. The lines are
power law ﬁts to data for a particular particle radius.

Typical results for changes in sediment height with time are shown in ﬁgure 3 for 275 nm
particles and gb = 0.275, Rg / R = 0.076 and different values of C/C*. In the initial slow
settling regime, the settling velocity is of the order of ~0.05 cm h‘1 (~100 nm s_l). After a
characteristic period of time, deﬁned as ‘L'delay, the rapid collapse regime is entered, during which
the gels collapse at rates that are an order of magnitude faster than in the initial slow settling
regime. At a given volume fraction, ‘L'delay increases with increasing polymer concentration.
Once the sediment collapses signiﬁcantly (to ~ half the initial column height to an average
volume fraction of ~2qb0), the fast settling regime again crosses over to a regime of slow gel
consolidation. In this second slow settling regime, consolidation, although slow, occurs for a
signiﬁcant amount of time after the end of rapid collapse. Below we ﬁrst discuss brieﬂy the
impact of the various system parameters on the initial settling velocity and the ﬁnal compacted
volume fraction, gbf, and then describe in detail our observations of the delay times.

4.1. Initial settling velocity

The initial settling velocities for all the transient gel samples studied are presented in
ﬁgure 4 where one can clearly distinguish the settling velocities of suspensions comprised
of particles of different size. Samples composed of the 188 nm colloids settle more slowly
with increasing polymer concentration than those composed of the 275 nm particles. This
behaviour is consistent with the gravitational force that drives settling increasing with particle
size. However, what is not expected is that for a given colloid size the initial settling velocity
appears to be independent of gb and Rg/R.

In their model for the sedimentation of gels, Buscall and White [36] predict that under
the effect of a uniform driving force the initial settling velocity of percolated networks should
depend on the compressive yield stress (Py) 0f the gel network. The model states that

fraction and sample height of the suspension, respectively, Ap is the difference in density of the
particles and the solvent (~900 kg n1‘3 for our system) and g is the gravitational acceleration.
5 ($0), the hydrodynamic resistance due to the up—ﬁow of the solvent, can be estimated from
the Carman—Kozeny permeability [37]: k(qbo) = 0.022R2(1_¢#)3 since S(qbo) ~ R2/k(q>0), or
other semi—empirical approaches. Py (gbo) is the compressive yield stress of the initial network.
The settling velocity of the particle at inﬁnite dilution is Mo = Mgp—TfRZ, where 775 is the solvent
Viscosity. We expect the parameters qb and Rg / R to have the greatest impact on Py (qbo) since
over the range of volume fractions studied the hydrodynamic resistance is not expected to vary
by a large amount. However, equation (3) becomes relatively insensitive to B when B 2 10.
Under these circumstances the initial settling velocity will be independent of the parameters
that govern the compressive yield stress of the gel network.

To test if the above scenario is applicable to our study, we estimate B for our system.
Channell and Zukoski [38] report that for aggregated alumina suspensions the ratio of the
compressive yield stress to the shear modulus, Py/ G’, is nearly constant (~10) over a wide
range of volume fractions and strengths of attraction. If we assume this to hold for our
depletion system as well, one can employ the relation [11] G’ = AGiVMCT, where G&MCT is
the prediction of the linear elastic modulus by the NMCT—PRISM theory [11] for the depletion
gels and A ~ 10—2 is a prefactor correction that accounts for the presence of dense clusters
in the concentrated gel [9, 11]. From ﬁgure 1 of KobeleV and Schweizer [28] one deduces
values of (?{\11\/ICT(Rg / R)2 ~ 0.5 over a volume fraction range of qb = 0.20—0.40 close to
the gel boundary, i.e. c/cgel —> 1. Using the above relations, for the 275 nm particles and
Rg/R = 0.076 and 0.029, we ﬁnd Py ~ 0.2 Pa (B ~ 200) and ~1.5 (B ~ 30), respectively,
close to the gel boundary. For the 188 nm particles and Rg / R = 0.086, we ﬁnd Py ~ 0.5 Pa
(B ~ 80). For the 275 nm particles, at both values of Rg/R, B 2 10 up to c/cgel ~ 1.25—2,
and for the 188 nm particles we estimate B 2 10 up to c/cgel ~ 1.5. Although there are
several approximations involved, the large calculated values of B for polymer concentrations
signiﬁcantly above the gel boundary are consistent with the hypothesis that these samples are
sufﬁciently weak (small Py) that the initial settling velocity is independent of qb and Rg / R over
the range explored in our study.

The weak dependence on polymer concentration can be attributed to the possibility that as
the gel network settles, the frictional force that the gel network experiences as it slips against
the walls of the Vial is proportional to the attractive depletion force between the container wall
and the particles at the gel network—wall interface. Again we expect this force to increase
with polymer concentration and therefore slow down the initial settling rate. Since we did
not perform experiments with Vials of variable gel—container adhesive interactions we cannot
comment in detail on the implications of such boundary conditions on the settling behaviour.

The initial settling velocities of the depletion gels in our study appear to be primarily
governed by the permeability to the up—ﬁow of the solvent. The increase in the settling velocity
of the gels beyond ‘L'delay can thus be attributed to a change in this permeability that could result
from structural changes driven by particle rearrangements.

Evans and Starrs [39] discuss the concept of a stress transmission length scale in transient
gels, wherein at sufﬁciently large initial sample heights the percolated network is incapable of
transmitting gravitational stresses to the bottom of the sample Vial. We propose that this can
also be interpreted as a sample that possesses a very small compressive yield stress relative to
the applied gravitational load (in other words, a very large B). Comparing our initial sample
heights (2 cm) with ﬁgure 13 of their study [39], and given the stronger gravitational force
arising from a larger density difference for our system, we believe our experiments are in a
regime where the sample height exceeds the stress transmission length scale.

Figure 5. Final colloid volume fraction as a function of the concentration of free polymer in the
suspension for all samples. The Open symbols are for gels of 275 nm particles whereas the closed
symbols are for 188 nm particles. The data indicates a weak dependence on polymer concentration
for both particle radii.
4.2. Final volumefmction
Figure 5 plots the ﬁnal volume fraction, gbf, at the end of the settling process as a function
of Cfree, deﬁned as the polymer concentration in the accessible volume of the suspension as
calculated according to the free volume model of Lekkerkerker and co—workers [40]. Plotting
the data in this manner enables a direct comparison with ﬁgure 2(0) in [12]. qbf is deﬁned as
gb0(H0/Hf) where Hf is the ﬁnal height of the sediment. Hf is determined when the settling
velocity of the suspension has approached, or is smaller than, the initial settling velocity of
the suspension (of the order of ~100 nm s_l), a value similar to that used previously [12].
We recognize that the suspension continues to settle slowly for a signiﬁcant amount of time
after the measurement of Hf, therefore making it impossible to obtain a true Hf. However,
within the constraints of this deﬁnition, we observe that, over a wide range of Cfree, qbf appears
fairly independent of Rg / R and R for the range of gbo employed in this study. However, qbf is
weakly dependent on polymer concentration. When compared to similar data on the PMMA
colloid system [12] at similar particle radii (275 nm in our study and 300 nm in [12]), Rg / R
ratios (0.076 in our study and ~0.06 in [12]) and gbo (0.225 in our study and 0.20 in [12]), we
note that in the silica—decalin system qbf is larger. This appears consistent with the fact that in
the silica—decalin system the gravitational forces are greater, and therefore a higher degree of
compaction is achieved, resulting in a larger gbf.
4.3. Delay time
The delay time, ‘L'delay, for samples composed of the 275 nm particles is shown in ﬁgure 6 as
a function of C/C*. ‘L'delay is determined from the intersection point of linear ﬁts to the initial
slow settling regime and the rapid collapse regime. As reported for PMMA depletion gels [12],
at a given value of Rg / R the time required to observe the rapid gel collapse increases with
gb. Decreasing Rg / R shifts ‘L'delay to smaller polymer concentrations, indicating that smaller
Rg / R ratios move the transient gel boundary to smaller C/C* at the same volume fractions.
These observations are consistent with the NMCT—PRISM calculations [11] that predict a
systematic decrease in the polymer concentration required to induce particle localization with

decreasing Rg / R . Decreasing Rg / R also results in a stronger dependence of ‘L'delay on polymer
concentration.

In addition to investigating the effects of Rg / R on delayed settling time, we are also
interested in how particle size inﬂuences rdelay. As noted above for the volume fractions
studied here, independent of the precise value of Rg / R(< O. 1), we found that delayed settling
was not observed for particles with a radius of 100 nm. At these sizes, we only observed a
slow settling regime with settling velocities that are an order of magnitude smaller than those
observed for the 275 nm particle suspensions. This indicates a lower size cut—off, below which
transient gel behaviour is not observable on practical timescales. The delay time is shown as
a function of c/c* for the two different particle radii samples of 188 and 275 nm at similar
gb and Rg / R in ﬁgure 7. Transient gels for the 275 nm particles are ﬁrst observed at smaller

polymer concentrations (c/c* ~ 0.10—0.12) than for the 188 nm particles (c/c* ~ 0.14—
0.16). Physically, and based on theory [4—6, 11], we expect that at the same qb and Rg/R,
localization will occur at the same c/c*. Therefore we interpret this result as indicating the
presence of residual van der Waals forces for the 275 nm particles that enhance the attractive
forces between particles in the presence of depletion attractions and lead to a smaller c/c*
required for localization. The silica—decalin system has a small refractive indeX mismatch and
hence van der Waals attractions between particles are not completely eliminated. At smaller
particle radii (25—50 nm), the octadecyl coating on the silica particle surface has been shown
to provide sufﬁcient steric stabilization to mimic near—hard sphere behaViour in decalin [10].
However with increasing particle size, the attractive interaction is expected to get stronger.

Further evidence for attractions in the absence of polymer can be found in the
sedimentation rates of the 188 and 275 nm colloids, providing a means to determine the
particle size at which these attractions become signiﬁcant. At volume fractions of 0.21 and
0.26, the 188 nm colloids have sett1ing velocities of used = 0.0035 cm h‘1 (~10 nm s_l) and
0.0025 cm h‘1 (~7 nm s_l), respectively. When divided by the settling velocity at this particle
size at inﬁnite dilution, uo, this translates to used/uo ~ 0.36 and ~0.26, respectively. For the
well characterized silica—cyclohexane hard sphere system, Kops—Werkhoven and Fijnaut [41]
report used/uo ~ 0.22—0.26 over a similar range of volume fractions, indicating that residual
attractions in the 188 nm particles are weak enough to not signiﬁcantly deviate from hard sphere
settling. On the other hand, for the 275 nm colloid samples, used/uo ~ 0.57 and 1.05 at volume
fractions of 0.225 and 0.275, respectively, suggesting that the residual van der Waals attractions
are indeed non—neg1igib1e at these particle sizes. Based on these sedimentation studies, we
conclude that for the 188 nm particle samples near hard sphere behaViour can be achieved.
However, residual attractions need to be taken into account in describing the behaViour of the
275 nm colloids.

Given the refractive indices of silica (1.448) and decalin (1.478), the Hamaker constant
is estimated [42] to be ~0.06kBT and the strength of attraction at contact (assumed to be
a surface—surface separation of 1 nm) is ~1kBT. This corresponds to a contact value of
a depletion potential generated at c/c* ~ 0.06 when calculated according to the Asakura—
Oosawa (A0) [43] model. If we assume that the well depth of the attractive van der Waals
interactions can be described as corresponding to that induced between particles at a polymer
concentration of c/c* = 0.06, and that these residual attractions will lower the polymer
concentration required to induce ge1ation, then the ge1ation polymer concentration for the
275 nm particles is lower than the value for the 188 nm particles which experience neg1igib1e
residual attractions by an amount c/c* = 0.06, i.e. cgel/c’kl275 Hm ~ Cgel/C*|188 Hm — 0.06.
This assumption is supported by the mismatch in the gel boundary polymer concentrations as
reported above.

For all of our subsequent analyses, we have used the adjusted polymer concentrations
for the 275 nm particle samples by an addition of 0.06 to the actual polymer concentrations
employed to account for the residual attractions in the system. In ﬁgure 8, we re—plot the data of
ﬁgure 7 by using the adjusted polymer concentrations for the 275 nm particles. We emphasize
that this method of adjusting the value of polymer concentrations to account for the presence
of residual van der Waals attractions merely shifts the curves to the right and does not change
their shape. As seen in ﬁgure 8, when keeping other parameters constant, a decrease in particle
radius results in an increase in the time required to observe ge1 collapse. Also, ‘L'delay becomes
more sensitive to polymer concentration and eXhibits a stronger than linear dependence (the
lines through the data points are exponential) for both particle sizes. Since the only difference
in these experiments is the colloid radius, we propose that this distinction in ‘L'delay reﬂects the
impact of graVity on setting the timescale for ge1 collapse.

5. Discussion
A large body of experimental [2, 9, 44—46] and theoretical work [4—8, 11, 28, 29] links the
mechanical strength of colloidal depletion gels to volume fraction, gb, the range of attraction
(Rg / R in our system), the strength of the attractive potential that physically bonds particles
(6/6* in our system), and the external perturbations that stress the gel network (gravity in our
system). We have systematically probed the impact of each of the above factors on ‘L'delay. Our
goal is to use these data to explore possible links between models of thermally activated particle
motion and delayed settling. Our hypothesis is that rearrangements due to activated processes
are the rate—limiting step in the catastrophic settling of depletion gels. We apply the activated
barrier—hopping theory for depletion gels [23] to suggest a scaling relationship between the
experimental ‘L'delay and the theoretical single particle barrier—hopping time, ‘L'Hop.
As seen in equation (2), parameters that have a signiﬁcant impact on the barrier height,
FB, will have the greatest inﬂuence on the particle hopping times. Theoretical calculations of
THOP/‘L'Q are shown as a function of polymer concentration, for a range of gb and two different
values of Rg / R, in ﬁgure 9(a). In a manner similar to the experimental trends of ‘L'delay, ‘L'Hop / to
increases with both gb and C/C* for a given Rg/R. In addition, increasing Rg / R decreases
THOP/‘L'Q, which is qualitatively consistent with experimental observations. Figure 9(b) shows
a master curve onto which all of the calculations in ﬁgure 9(a) roughly collapse by deﬁning
a composite parameter proposed by Chen et al [23], 6 = G(qb)[c/c*][R/Rg]0'75. Here
G(gb) = 0.5 —|— 7.8gb —|— 27gb2 is an empirical function used to collapse the theoretical data
at different volume fractions, which also has a physical basis since it is closely related to the
volume fraction dependence of the number of sticky depletion bonds per colloid as computed
using PRISM theory [23]. The quality of the collapse is not as good for very low Rg / R values;
however, this can be improved by modest changes to the exponent of R / Rg in the deﬁnition of
6. If the single particle events control delayed settling we anticipate that the delay times will
also be controlled by the variable 6.

t0 steric stabilization or variable gravitational stresses in modulating the dynamics of particle
rearrangements. There is also the experimental issue of the role of via] diameter. We have
not investigated this question, but comparison of our results with the measurements of Starr
et al [47] suggests our Vial size is greater than the so—called stress transmission length scale.
We speculate the system—dependent physics not accounted for within the existing theoretical
framework may be the primary origin of the discrepancies for the prefactor a. Of course, even
more fundamental origins of the discrepancies 0f the disparate values of a cannot be ruled out.
However, in spite of inherent complexities that regulate the exact dependences, the fact that the
delay times for a wide range of C/C*, gb and Rg / R values collapse reasonably well onto a master
curve with 6 as the scaling variable for two distinct experimental systems provides support for
both the theory and the hypothesis that single—particle ‘hopping’ events are the rate—limiting
step in determining the timescales for macroscopic gel collapse.

Although the absolute delay times for the different particle size samples are rather similar
in magnitude, as seen in ﬁgure 8, we believe that the normalization by the elementary
Brownian diffusion time, 1'0, is essential to capturing the particle—size—dependent physics that
is independent of its trivial dependence on colloid radius. The presence of a particle size
dependence in the collapse of the data in ﬁgure 10 clearly suggests additional effects associated
with the absolute particle size are missing in the theory.

As rheological measurements on transient PMMA depletion gels [12] have demonstrated,
increasing the external stress weakens the network strength and shortens ‘L'delay. The theory
as currently applied does not incorporate the effects of gravitational stresses acting on non—
density—matched particles. However, the theory has been recently generalized to include this
aspect [28, 29]. The inset of ﬁgure 1 shows how external stress decreases the barrier, FB,
thus enhancing mobility. Incorporating the gravitational stresses provides a framework for
describing how an increase in the stress enhances bond—breakage rates, ultimately increasing
the rate at which the gel structure coarsens, and reduces delay times. We note that enhanced
bond breakage rates in the presence of a stress are also included in a model of Tanaka and
co—workers [48].

Figure 11. Dimensionless theoretical hopping time [23, 29] as a function of 9 for two values of
applied dimensionless stress, 80R3 /kBT. Predictions at different stresses collapse onto distinct
master curves.

The predictions of the activated barrier—hopping theory in the presence of an external
stress [28, 29] are shown in ﬁgure 11. At given values of gb, C/C* and Rg / R (i.e. constant 6),
increasing the forces acting on individual particles decreases THOP/‘L'Q. However, the collapse
of the ‘L'Hop /‘L'0 predictions onto a master curve when plotted as a function of 6 is retained under
the inﬂuence of an external stress with a slightly smaller prefactor (a ~ 3.75). Within the
context of the model, stress weakens particle localization, leading to faster ‘hopping’ times or
larger bond breakage rates.

Since larger particles feel a stronger gravitational force, gels are subjected to a stronger
stress when the colloid size increases. The enhanced gravitational force acting on ge1s
composed of 275 nm particles, over those composed of 188 nm particles at a given 6, then
provides a qualitative rationale for the collapse of ‘L'delay onto a single master curve for a given
colloid size but different master curves for different particle sizes. In addition, 1arge colloids
eXhibit a smaller elastic modulus and yield stress (all other factors being held constant), a trend
which is also expected to result in enhanced ge1 collapsibility as particle radius increases.

Note that, within the theory, stress modiﬁes the dependence of FB on system parameters,
giVing rise to modestly different slopes of the master curves of ‘L'Hop /‘L'() as a function of 8. We
obtain simple estimates of the magnitude of the gravitational forces on our particles based on
two assumptions. The ﬁrst is that the drag due to the up—ﬁow of the solvent during the initial
stages is negligible, and hence the only external force on the gel network is the gravitational
force. The second is that, since the scattering studies of Shah et al [10] suggest that the
percolated gel is composed of clusters of particles with radii that are ~5—8 times the radius
of the individual particles, we consider these clusters as the settling entities. The gravitational
force is then VCApg, where VC 2 4771(5 — 8R)3 ~ (100 — 500“?er3 is the volume of the
cluster. Non—dimensionalizing the force by (2R) / kB T, in a manner consistent with the theory,
then gives non—dimensionalized forces of ~10—50 for the 275 nm particles and ~2—11 for the
188 nm particles. These numbers fall within the range of stress values for which the model
predictions of hopping times in ﬁgure 11 display distinct universal curves. For the PMMA
system in the inset of ﬁgure 10, Ap ~ 300 kg n1‘3 and R = 301 nm; employing the same
cluster size, we obtained non—dimensionalized gravitational forces of ~5—25. This range falls
between that obtained for the 275 nm and the 188 nm particles. Indeed comparison of the inset

"
"19","11548 V Gopalakrishnan et al
and main plot in ﬁgure 11 shows that the master curve for the PMMA colloids falls between the
curves for our two silica systems. This seems qualitatively consistent with the rough estimates
of the gravitational forces in the PMMA transient gels being intermediate between that for our
275 and 188 nm silica particles. However the origin of the differences in the slope or prefactor,
a, in the relation ‘L'delay/‘L'Q ~ e09 remains unclear.

A particle—size—dependent hopping time also provides a rationale for a lower particle—size
cut—off below which we are unable to observe transient gel behaviour. At small particle sizes,
longer hopping times and a steeper dependence on 6 ensures that the window of polymer
concentrations for the formation of transient gels is either very narrow or non—eXistent on the
experimental timescale.

Finally, we comment on two very recent experimental studies of gel collapse by
others [48, 49]. In contrast to our work, both these studies involved charged colloids at
low volume fractions, where the concepts of percolation and fractal aggregate formation are
important. In both studies the long time gel collapse phenomenon of present interest was not
observed due to the very high interparticle attractions of the systems studied (~2OkB T) and
the unmeasurably long single particle activated hopping times. Manley et al [49] measured
the ‘creeping sedimentation’ process, and found its characteristic timescale shortens with
increasing (low) colloid volume fraction, opposite to our delayed gel collapse results. Tanaka
et al [48] focused on the issue of coupling of phase separation and gel formation, including
the idea that mechanical stress is induced in the gel Via a Viscoelastic mechanism which can
generate network coarsening. This aspect has not been addressed in our theoretical analysis.
However, the crucial point is that, in contrast to the recent studies [48, 49], our use of relatively
weak depletion attractions results in experimentally relevant activated hopping timescales,
which one might expect is the leading order process for triggering gel collapse.

6. Summary and conclusion

In this work we have conducted a systematic study of the delayed settling phenomenon
in depletion gels using octadecyl silica particles. Our goal was to determine if there is
a link between the delay times for gel collapse and the elementary barrier—crossing events
predicted by the activated barrier—hopping theory [20, 23, 24, 27—29]. Building on observations
made in the PMMA depletion system [12], we ﬁnd that delayed settling is dependent on
volume fraction, polymer concentration and ratio of polymer radius of gyration to particle
radius. However, by suitably ‘lumping’ these variables into one composite parameter, 6,
predicted to be the key scaling variable for the hopping time for gelled systems [23],
the delay times for a given particle size collapse reasonably well onto master curves for
two distinct experimental systems (PMMA and silica depletion gels). The theoretical
calculations predict a steeper dependence of hopping times on 6 than is observed for the
delay times in the two distinct experimental systems. This might be attributable to subtle
(and unaccounted for) features of system—dependent particle interactions that modulate the
dynamics of particle rearrangements. However, more theoretical work is clearly required
to better understand this quantitative aspect. Nevertheless, we ﬁnd it rather remarkable that
despite the multitude of complex macroscopic structural evolutions observed in transient gels
prior to delayed settling, a successful scaling and collapse of delay times can be achieved.
This provides signiﬁcant support for the idea that the underlying physical processes giving
rise to gel collapse are tightly coupled to single particle activated hopping events. The
master curves are observed to be dependent on the particle radius, and this trend can be
qualitatively accounted for by the difference in gravitational force acting on particles of
different sizes.
