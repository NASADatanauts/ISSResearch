Abstract—Crystals of recombinant carboxypeptidase T (CPT) from T hermoacz‘inomyces vulgaris were grown
in a capillary by the counteragiffusion method in the absence of calcium ions. The three—dimensional structure
of CPT was solved at 169— resolution using the X—ray diffraction data collected from the crystals of the
enzyme on the SPring—8 synchrotron radiation facility and was then reﬁned to Rfact = 16.903% and Rfree =
18.165%. The coordinates of the reﬁned model were deposited in the Protein Data Bank (PDB ID: 3QNV).
A comparison of this structure with the structure ofwild—type CPT containing bound calcium ions, which was
determined earlier, revealed a number of conformational changes both in the calcium—binding sites and the
enzyme active site. Based on the results of this comparison, the possible factors responsible for the difference
in the catalytic activity of the two forms of the enzyme are considered.
