Abstract

We present here the energy spectra relative to different geomagnetic regions as measured by the ALTEA (Anomalous Long Term
Effects on Astronauts) detector in the International Space Station — USLab from August 2006 to J uly 2007.

ALTEA is an active detector composed by siX silicon telescopes and it is able to follow the dynamics of the radiation ﬂux, with the
capability to discriminate impinging nuclei from Boron t0 Molybdenum. We divided each orbit in three regions (polar, equatorial and
South Atlantic Anomaly), according to the values of the geomagnetic coordinates, and show the relative energy spectra. Finally we cal—
culated the relative nuclear abundances compared to the ones of the total data. As expected all nuclear species are similarly modulated by
the geomagnetic cutoff.

2. The ALTEA-space detector 105
The ALTEA cosmic ray detector is composed by six Sil-

icon Detector Units (SDUs) arranged on a helmet-shaped 10‘ '11 0

structure2 as shown in Fig. 1. Each SDU consists of three 41G [11

pairs of silicon ladders. The ladders are composed of two 103 11V .m Mg

chips, each divided in 32 strips with 2.5 mm pitch, and .3 1.~- A N 8|

are alternatively oriented along X and Y directions. Each § W s

silicon chip has a size of 8 x 80m, and a thickness of 102 c. N K 6‘ Fe

the correspondent Y View is 3.75 mm, while the distance 10 1 ‘ 1

between two ladders couple is 37.5 mm. This results in a 1
