g The Hyperspectral Imager for the Coastal Ocean (HICO) was used to derive chlor-

N ophyll-a (chl-a) based on the normalized difference chlorophyll index (NDCI) in two

E? remote sensing reﬂectance in Pensacola Bay (PB) and Choctawhatchee Bay (CB).

?‘ NDCI algorithm calibrations and validations were completed on HICO data. Linear

8 and best-ﬁt (polynomial) calibrations performed strongly with R2 of 0.90 and 0.96,

{3 respectively. The best validation of NDCI resulted with an R2 of 0.74 and root-mean-

.3“ square error (RMSE) of 1.64 pg/L. A strong spatial correspondence was observed

é between NDCT arid ehl-a, with higher NDCI associated with higher chlfa and these

§ 1. Introduction

ii: The Gulf of Mexico estuaries and coasts are major ecological and economic resources.

—«2 The 5 coastal states bordering the Gulf of Mexico contribute >$2.2 trillion dollars to the

E nation’s economy, supply >1.2 billion pounds of seafood annually, and support 6 of the

Q top 10 shipping ports in the country (NCAA 2008). As valuable aquatic resources, these
waters are protected by the Clean Water Act (CWA) through the use of water quality
standards. Traditional water quality measures typically include measures of chlorophyll-a
(chl-a), total suspended solids (TSS), light attenuation, and colored dissolved organic
matter (CDOM), and all are currently derived from satellite ocean color technology. For a
review of measurable water quality variables from satellite remote sensing, see Muller-
Karger (1992). Chl-a is used as a proxy for phytoplankton biomass and can be an
indicator of increased nutrients (Devlin, Bricker, and Painting 2011; Ferreira et a1. 2011;
Schaeffer et a1. 2012) or a direct measure of potential harmful algal bloom development
(Stumpf et a1. 2003). Chl-a concentration, a widely used bio—indicator of phytoplankton
abundance and eutrophication, is a parameter that serves as an overall indicator of
environmental stress and is used to assess water quality in estuarine systems (Huang,

Mukherjee, and Chen 2011; Hu et al. 2004; Wang et al. 2010; Messina 2004). Chl-a is
also a natural contributor to light attenuation, (Huang, Mukherjee, and Chen 2011) where
light attenuation is the sum of scattering and light absorption by phytoplankton pigments,
detritus, and colored dissolved organic matter.
Recent research trends in the development of remote sensing algorithms for chl—a
prediction have focused on the use of red and near—infrared (NIR) wavebands instead of
blue and green wavebands as used in ocean color (OCX) algorithms (O’Reilly et al. 2000).
The blue—green algorithms have been reported to be inaccurate when applied to shallow
coastal waters and inland turbid waters and this resulted in the shift to red—NIR-based models.
Red—NIR-based algorithms can be separated into four maj or groups including empiri-
cal, two-band, three-band, and four-band models. Empirical models are mainly based on
regression between satellite-derived reﬂectance measurements and in Situ chl-a concen-
v tration. For example, Kabbara et al. (2008) used Landsat—7 Enhanced Thematic Mapper +
§ (ETM+) and Landsat-5 Thematic Mapper (TM) bands to develop an empirical algorithm
4; for chl—a mapping. Han and Jordan (2005) used band ratios and regression models for
0:13 estimating chl-a in Pensacola Bay (PB). Wu et al. (2009) used Moderate Resolution
<t Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) band ratios to demonstrate their capability in chl—a
ﬂ estimation. The problem with the empirical models is that they need parameterization for
3 individual waterbodies or waterbody types.
5 The two-band models (Gitelson et al. 2008; Gons, Auer, and Efﬂer 2008; Moses et al.
ES 2009; Gitelson et al. 2009; Gilerson et al. 2010; Moses et al. 2012) are based on band ratio, Rrs
E (x12)/Rrs(/11), where 21 is located near the chl—a absorption peak at ~675 nm, and 22 is typically
5 located between 700 and 720 nm, which is the spectral region of the chl—a reﬂectance peak.
2? For MODIS sensor, Gitelson et al. (2008, 2009) and Moses et al. (2009) used bands 13 and
E 15 centered at 667 and 748 nm, respectively. Moses et al. (2009, 2012) and Gilerson et al.
g (2010) have also re-parameterized their algorithms for MEdium Resolution Imaging
<3: Spectrometer (MERIS) bands 7 and 9 centered at 708 and 665 nm, respectively. Gons,
C3 Auer, and Efﬂer (2008) also used MERIS bands 7 and 9 but added the effect of the apparent
i)” backscatter coefﬁcient (bb) calculated using MERIS band 12, centered at 778 nm.
3 The three-band models (Dall’Olmo, Gitelson, and Rundquist 2003; Gitelson et al.
: 2008, 2009, 2011; Moses et al. 2009, 2012; Le et al. 2009; Gilerson et al. 2010; Chen
ﬁ et al. 2011) are generally based on normalization of inverse reﬂectance at two bands such
g as [R801 1)_1 — RrS(/12)_1]Rrs(/l3), where his most sensitive to chl—a absorption (red band),
3 22 is minimally sensitive to chl-a absorption, and 23 is sensitive to residual backscattering
E and not sensitive to water constituent absorption. These algorithms have been tested using
8 in Sim hyperspectral data and MERIS Visible near-infrared (VNIR) bands. The three-band
models were also tested on the Hyperspectral Imager for the Coastal Ocean (HICO) data
by Gitelson et al. (2011) and on Hyperion data by Chen et al. (2011).Yang et al. (2011)
combined work of Gitelson et al. (2008) and Ammenberg et al. (2002) and derived a
three-band approach based on the regression analysis between the model output and
constituent concentrations using MERIS bands 7, 9, and 10 such as [RrS(B10) >< Rrs
(1307) _1] — [Rrs(B10) X Rrs(B09) _1]-
The four-band model proposed by Le et al. (2009) replaced the term RrS(/l3) in
Gitelson et al.’s (2008) three-band model with [l’QrS(/l4)_1 — RrS(/l3)_1] _1 to minimize the
impact of absorption and backscattering from detrital particles at 23. Their assumption that
CDOM and detrital absorptions at 22 are close to those at 21 and the same is true for x13 and
x14 and that bb(/l) is approximately equal at all four wavelengths was similar to the three-
band model. From band tuning and accuracy optimization, they found that the position of
21, x12, 23, and 24 are 663, 693, 705, and 740 nm, respectively. The model was calibrated

"

and validated for Lake Taihu, China, where the chl-a range is 098—8923 ug/ni?’ and T88
is 8.53—21360 nig/ni3, with a chl-a model calibration r2 of 0.89 and 0.97 for two different
datasets. The performance of the three- and four- band models was further examined and
validated for wider geographic extent by adding Lake Chaohu and Three Gorges
Reservoirs (Le et al. 2011). An improvement was made by classifying the water spectra
based on the slope of the Rrs in three bands: Rrs (R), Rrs®, and Rrs (NIR). The ﬁnding
showed that the improvement increased the r2 and decreased the relative errors for the
classiﬁed datasets. The model may have the potential for application to hyperspectral
satellite sensors and MERIS which have the channels located at the desired wavelengths.

The main limitation is the use of a band in between 748 and 778 nm in all the three
algorithms. A band that far in the NIR region is often dominated by water absorption and,
given the existing atmospheric correction schemes for turbid productive waters, getting

v reliable estimates of Rrs at these wavelengths is a difﬁcult task. The other problem is that
§ output from these algorithms is not normalized and scaled, i.e., they do not have a ﬁxed
4;; lower or upper limit; therefore, their application to a new study site often requires
Eb calibration using in Situ data which is a difﬁcult task for under—sampled locations. To
<71s address these issues, Mishra and Mishra (2012) developed the normalized difference
ﬂ chlorophyll index (NDCI) for chl-a estimation in water using the concepts similar to the
3 Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) for vegetation (Tucker 1979). NDVI is
g based on normalization of the difference between a highly reﬂecting band (NIR) and a
E? highly absorbing band (red) in vegetation. The normalization procedure makes the indeX
E scaled with a lower and upper limit of —1 and +1, respectively. NDCI also has the same
8 theoretical lower and upper limit (Mishra and Mishra 2012).

Z? The basis for the index is to use the 700 nm reﬂectance and 665 nm absorption to
E maximize chl-a sensitiVity. NDCI was developed by simulating the MERIS bands and
g formulated as [Rrs(708)—Rrs(665)]/ [Rrs(708) + Rrs(665)]. The conceptual model was then
<3: calibrated and validated using ﬁeld data and MERIS data from three study sites
C3 (Chesapeake Bay, Mobile Bay, and Mississippi Delta), and further calibration and valida-
i)” tion was performed for different ranges of solar zenith angles and solar azimuth angles.
3 NDCI has three main advantages compared to the aforementioned models: (1) normal-
: izing by the sum of reﬂectance at the two bands eliminates any uncertainties in the
ﬁ estimation of Rrs, seasonal solar azimuth differences, and atmospheric contributions at
g these wavelengths; (2) the range varies between —1 and +1, therefore, qualitative chl-a
E mapping and bloom detection using satellite data is possible for remote areas where ﬁeld
E data is limited; and (3) a chl-a range can be quantitatively associated with NDCI value for
8 any given pixel/location, which makes mapping of chl-a concentration possible.

The objective of this research was to test the above-listed advantages and demonstrate
the applicability of NDCI on HICO data for the two study sites. HICO was the ﬁrst
remote sensor designed speciﬁcally to image the coastal ocean, and this was the ﬁrst time
International Space Station (188) was used as a platform for scientiﬁc earth observations.
HICO spatial resolution is approximately 90 m with spectral coverage from 380 to 900
nm with less than 6 nm resolution (Corson et al. 2006). In this study, the performance of
NDCI was assessed by (1) calibrating and validating using in Situ hyperspectral datasets,
(2) calibrating and validating using HICO data for different dates and sites, and (3)
mapping and validating chl-a concentration using the pre-established NDCI and chl-a
range relationship (hereafter chl-aQual) provided in Mishra and Mishra (2012). In this
paper, for the ﬁrst time, we demonstrated the applicability of NDCI on a dataset from a
space-based sensor other than MERIS using which NDCI was calibrated during the initial
development.

2. Study area
Pensacola Bay (PB) is supplied by three main rivers, and Choctawhatchee Bay (CB) has
one main river (third largest in the state of Florida) that feeds the top of the estuary
(Figure 1). Mean annual freshwater discharge of PB is 324 m3s_1(Bianchi, Pennock, and
Twilley 1999) and of CB is 204 m3s_1(Kenner, Hampton, and Conover 1971). These
systems also possess large watershed areas, 18,125 km2 and 13,835 km2 for PB and CB,
respectively. The coastal waters in this region retain a score of “good—fair condition” on
the Gulf Coast Water Quality Index (EPA 2012). Land use is dominated by forest and
wetlands, and the residing counties eXhibit population growth rates between 5 % and
33%, which are some of the highest in the state (US Census Bureau 2007). Northwest
Florida estuaries are classiﬁed as optically complex, or waters inﬂuenced by chl-a,
colored dissolved organic matter, suspended solids, and bottom reﬂectance.

3.1.1. Water samples
Sampling stations were located to characterize water quality and optical properties
where HICO imagery could be acquired as well as along the major salinity gradients
of each estuary. Discrete samples were typically processed within 24 hours of collec-
tion. Discrete water samples were collected 0.5 m below the surface, away from boat
engines, using a 2 L brown Nalgene bottle for the post cruise analysis of chl-a. Water
was ﬁltered through Whatman 47 mm GF/F ﬁlters (Sigma-Aldrich Corp., St. Louis,
MO, USA; nominal pore size = 0.7 am) for chl-a analysis. Filters were extracted in
methanol and ﬂuorescence was measured with a Turner Designs (TD700) ﬂuorometer
(Turner Designs Corp., Sunnyvale, CA, USA). Associated pigment interference from
chlorophyll-b and phaeopigments were minimized through the use of a 436 nm excita-
tion ﬁlter, 680 nm emission ﬁlter, and two neutral density reference ﬁlters with a blue

3 lamp (Welschmeyer 1994).

:1"" 3.1.2. Hyperspectml surface acquisition system (HyperSAS)

ﬂ Rrs was derived using a hyperspectral surface acquisition system (HyperSAS, Satlantic

3 Inc., Halifax, Nova Scotia). The HyperSAS logged spectral measurements of above-

: water radiance (Lt(/l)), sky radiance (Li(/l)), and downwelling sky irradiance (ES(/l))

E; from 350—800 nm (interpolated at 1 nm intervals). HyperSAS radiance sensors were

E mounted on the port side of the pilot house roof of a 25 ft boat to provide 400 nadir

8 and zenith Viewing angles (Mobley 1999). During data acquisition, the boat was

>‘ positioned so that the radiance sensors were perpendicular to the Sun’s azimuth and

E to avoid boat shadow and wake. The irradiance sensor was mounted above the deck

g canopy for an unobstructed View of the sky. During the same time as the HyperSAS

c: acquisition, an absorption and beam attenuation-spectra (AC-s) (WET—Labs, Philmoth,

C3 OR) quantiﬁed in Situ vertical proﬁles of absorption (a) and beam attenuation (c) from

i)” 400—735 nm interpolated to every 1 nm. Temperature and salinity corrections were

3 applied using corresponding Seabird conductivity, temperature, and depth (CTD) data

: (Sullivan et al. 2006). The AC-s a, c, and derived [9 values were averaged over the

§ surface of the water column to Secchi depth. The above water Rrs spectra were

,8 corrected, following the surface correction algorithm of Gould, Arnone, and Sydor

E (2001), using the average absorption at 412 nm and derived spectral scattering shape

E (Gould, Arnone, and Sydor 2001).

8 HyperSAS Rrs data for each sampling location were analyzed to perform NDCI
model calibration, validation, and performance evaluation. HyperSAS Rrs data were
integrated over the NDCI required bandwidth of ﬁve different sensors: HICO,
Hyperion, MERIS, Multi-spectral Instrument (MSI) on Sentinel-2, and the Ocean and
Land Color Instrument (OCLI) on Sentinel-3 (Table 1). The other four space-borne
sensors were chosen because they have the necessary spectral bands available for
computing NDCI and other chl-a algorithms which allowed inter-sensor NDCI perfor-
mance comparison. Multiple calibrations were performed: (1) aforementioned sensors
derived NDVI versus chl-a, (2) comparison calibration between two-band model and
NDCI for the ﬁve sensors, and (3) linear and polynomial calibration between HyperSAS
derived NDCI and chl-a. Both quantitative and qualitative validation was performed
using the coefﬁcients and the NDCI range—concentration association, respectively, as
proposed in Mishra and Mishra (2012).

3.2. HICO image processing
HICO images dated June, July, and August 2011 from the estuaries were downloaded as
radiometrically calibrated Level 1B top-of—atmosphere (TOA) at-sensor radiances from
the Oregon State University (OSU) website (http://hico.coas.oregonstateedu/index.shtml).
The image was corrected to remove the effects of sun glint using the method described by
Goodman, Lee, and Ustin (2008). In the Goodman et a1. approach, sun glint was
eliminated by subtracting radiance at 750 nm from the radiance at each wavelength (Li).
An offset (A) was applied to prevent negative values in the NIR due to overcorrection, as
the corrected radiance approaches zero at 750 nm (Kay, Hedley, and Lavender 2009). The
process to correct for sun glint was expressed as

{Q nm, A = offset, and A + B = constants. In this approach, we used the values of Goodman
‘5 et a1., which are A = 0.000019 and B = 0.1.

§
8; 3.2.1. Atmospheric correction
E Atmospherically corrected at-surface reﬂectances were retrieved from HICO images using
2 the offshore (dark) pixel subtraction approach (Hadjimitsis et a1. 2012; Tuﬁllaro, Davis,
J: and Jones 2011; Chavez 1988) to remove atmospheric effects. In this approach, atmo-
COD) spheric effects are removed by determining the at-sensor radiance for a pixel in waters
i)” offshore (LMOffShorQ) This “dark” pixel was characterized by spectra whose radiances
3 were less “bright” than spectra within the estuary. These radiances are subtracted from the
: total at-sensor radiance (Lt) for the image, leaving the residual estuary water-1eaVing
ﬁ radiance (Lw(estuary)) (Chavez 1988; Miller and McKee 2004) as

8 where LW (Offshore) is the dark water radiance and LMemary) is the bright water radiance.
Two basic assumptions with this approach were that (1) the atmospheric radiances (La)
were homogeneous across the scene such that aerosol size and type did not change over
the distance from the dark pixel to the estuary pixels and (2) the amount of light in the red
portion of the spectrum emanating from the surface waters of the offshore pixel was
negligible. However, previous studies have shown that the second assumption was not
entirely valid in coastal areas (Palandro 2006; Hadjimitsis et a1. 2012).
The LMCSmary) values were converted to surface reﬂectance (pw) using (Hu et a1. 2004)
pW : (71:LW(/1))/Focos6S (4)
where LW(/1) = water-1eaVing radiance, F0 = mean solar irradiance, and (95 = solar
zenith angle (degrees). Surface reﬂectance was converted to remote sensing reﬂectance
Rrs(0 +, 2; sr_l) as follows (Hu et a1. 2004):

< geometry information in the rad_geom ﬁle was associated with each image and projected
ﬂ using geographic (spherical) coordinates (degree units) of longitude and latitude using

% (GIS) image of the estuary of interest to identify ground control points (GCPs). Each
{3 image was also warped and rotated in ENVI using ﬁrst degree RST (rotation, scaling, and

3; 3.2.3. NDCI Cal/Val
i‘: Two sets of calibration, linear and polynomial, were performed using HICO derived NDCI
H2 and in Situ chl-a. Three sets of quantitative validation (hereafter NDCIQuantitative) were
5 performed for two dates using the (1) HICO polynomial calibration coefﬁcients, (2) HICO
Q linear coefﬁcients, and (3) polynomial calibration coefﬁcients provided in Mishra and Mishra
(2012). The accuracy of the NDCI model was assessed by calculating the root-mean-square
error (RMSE) of the predicted chl—a concentrations from the following equation:
/ 2
RMSE(Hg/L) = —(2 Chl ameaxei 1 Chl apredmd) (8)
Accuracy was also determined from the coefﬁcient of determination, R2, between the
measured chl—a values and predicted chl-a concentrations using linear regression analysis
(Laws 1997). A qualitative validation (hereafter NDCIQuahtative) was also performed using
the NDCI and chl-a range—concentration association developed by Mishra and Mishra
(2012). Residuals for individual validation were calculated by subtracting estimated chl—a
from actual chl-a. The most accurate validation was used to prepare the chl-a spatial

4. Results and discussion
4.1. Analysis onyperSAS Rm
Analysis of in Situ hyperspectral Rrs data collected using HyperSAS for PB 0n 2 June
2011 revealed higher spectral variability between 600 and 700 nm compared to the blue
and green wavelengths. The characteristic chl-a absorption at 675 and the algal scattering
induced reﬂectance around 700 nm were not prominent due to the low chl-a concentra—
tions in PB waters (max chl-a 0n 2 June: 12.8 Mg/L) (Figure 2). However, reﬂectance at
675 and 700 nm did not saturate even at very low chl-a concentration, indicating the
potential of NDCI as a predictive model. In addition, band selection testing was per—
3 formed by calculating and plotting the standard error (STE) and coefﬁcient of determina—
8 tion (R2) between reﬂectance at each wavelength (400—735 nm at 1 nm interval) and chl-a
‘3 concentration (Figure 3). The wavelength range from 610 to 710 nm showed high R2 and
:50 low RMSE, further establishing the fact that NDCI could be used to predict chl-a
00 concentration in these waters.

: remote sens1ng data. Similar to NDVI, the range of chl-a concentration ass001ated With the
ﬁ NDCI range, as proposed in Mishra and Mishra (2012), can be used to assess the chl-a
,3 concentration for each pixel with known NDCI values. As an example, a qualitative
E validation using HyperSAS derived NDCI is presented in this study (Table 2a). NDCI
E was calculated from HyperSAS dataset, simulated for each sensor, and chl-a range for each
8 sampling location was qualitatively predicted from the corresponding NDCI values
(NDCIQuahtative). When compared with the measured chl-a, HICO and Hyperion simulated
NDCI resulted in 100% accurate prediction (13 out of 13), Sentinel-2 simulated NDCI
showed 92% accurate prediction (12 out of 13), and MERIS and Sentinel-2 simulated NDCI
resulted in 85% accurate prediction (11 out of 13) (Table 2b). The accurate prediction of
chl-a using NDCIQuahtaﬁve for remote areas, where ﬁeld data is limited, is a signiﬁcant
improvement and potential alternative to currently existing, widely used, and fairly accurate
two-band, three-band, and four—band prediction algorithms.

Quantitative validation was also performed using the non-linear best-ﬁt coefﬁcients
proposed in Mishra and Mishra (2012) (a0: 13.55, a1: 87.99, and a2: 212.609). The RMSE
for chl-a prediction for all the simulated sensor data ranged between 2 and 3 ng/L
(Table 3). This also proves the fact that the coefﬁcients proposed in this study can be
readily used on NDCI images derived from any of these sensors to accurately predict chl-
a concentration. This was expected because the NDCI calibration presented in Mishra and

information is not required for this type of atmospheric correction because removing the
contribution of atmospheric backscattering from the at—sensor radiance curve is not
dependent on the precise location of spectral channels for water vapor and absorption
features. The dark pixel subtraction approach could create an overcorrection which results
in negative Rrs values in the blue portion of the spectrum (Moses et al. 2009; Palandro
2006). To address this issue, an offset (avg. 0.003 sr_l) determined by Rrs values at 450
nm was applied to the spectra for adjusting the reﬂectance values to yield positive values
in the blue portion of the spectrum (Hu et al. 2004).

The average atmospherically corrected HICO Rrs data were matched with the average
HyperSAS Rrs for all sampling locations (Figure 8). The standard deviation of all Rrs data
for both HICO and corresponding in Sim locations were also plotted on the average
spectra. The shape of the atmospheric corrected HICO Rrs spectra showed a strong
v similarity with the HyperSAS Rrs, particularly in the green wavelength (490—600 nm)
§ portion. The maximum difference was observed in the blue wavelength (400—450 nm),
4; which could be due to the error in the scattering estimation for short wavelengths. A
go strong variability was observed in the HICO Rrs for the blue wavelength region, whereas a
< similar strong variability was observed for the red/NIR portion of the in Sim Rrs. This
g shows that the atmospheric correction procedure was not able to completely remove the
a intense Rayleigh scattering generally detected in shorter wavelengths even after the
‘5 application of the offset. The magnitude of variability that was observed for the red—
‘6 NIR wavelength in the HyperSAS Rrs data was not manifested in the HICO Rrs data,
E indicating a reduced sensitivity to in—water optically active constituents, mainly phyto—
5 plankton, in HICO data (Figure 8).

E 4.4. NDCI Cal/Val using HICO data
35 Linear and best—ﬁt (polynomial) calibrations were performed using HICO derived NDCI
<3: on 2 June 2011 and the chl-a values for the corresponding pixels (Figure 9). The two
C3 calibrations performed strongly with R2 of 0.90 for linear and 0.96 for polynomial.
i)” Very similar results were also observed during the HyperSAS derived NDCI calibration
3 (Figure 5). Linear calibration performed poorly compared to the polynomial calibration
: because of a slight saturation observed for HICO NDCI values at very low chl-a
ﬁ concentrations. Mishra and Mishra (2012) noted that NDCI values will be positive
g when chl-a concentration exceeds 16 pg/L. This was evident in the calibration, where
E NDCI values were all negative because the chl-a range was <16 pg/L at any location for
E both study sites (Figure 9).
8 Validations were performed on an independent dataset, i.e., on the HICO image
acquired on 26 August 2011 (Figure 10). Three types of NDCIQuantitative validations were
carried out: (1) using the polynomial calibration on 2 June HICO dataset (Figure 10a), (2)
using the linear calibration on 2 June HICO dataset (Figure 10b), and (3) using the
polynomial calibration coefﬁcient provided in Mishra and Mishra (2012) (Figure 100).
Among the three, the validation using the coefﬁcients taken from Mishra and Mishra
(2012) performed best with an R2 of 0.74, RMSE of 1.64 pg/L, and the highest slope of
the validation trend line of 0.52. The validations using the polynomial and linear coefﬁ-
cients derived from 2 June HICO calibration performed relatively poorly with RMSE of
4.98 and 4.1 pg/L, respectively. The accuracy of these validations suffered from the large
deviations observed at low chl-a concentrations during calibration. In all cases, the slope of
the validation trend line was observed to be far off from 1:1 line, particularly for the
calibrations using the 2 June HICO data. The validation using the previously published
calibration coefﬁcients from Mishra and Mishra (2012) performed surprisingly well even at

3 large prediction errors at high chl-a values. The residuals, particularly for the validation
: using the Mishra and Mishra (2012) calibration coefﬁcients, did not show any signiﬁcant

% In addition, another set of NDCIQuantitative validations were performed on both 2 June
:3 and 26 August HICO data using the linear and polynomial coefﬁcients derived from the
g HyperSAS calibration, i.e., from HyperSAS Rrs versus chl-a (as given in Figure 5). This
8 was performed to test whether in Sim NDCI calibration performs better than HICO
calibrations and whether it can be used to predict chl-a from HICO data. The RMSE
errors for 2 June image validations were 2.6 ng/L for linear and 1.96 ug/L for polynomial
model (Figure 11a). The RMSE errors for 26 August image validations were more than
the 2 June image validations with 3.76 ng/L for linear and 4.22 ug/L for polynomial
model (Figure 11b). However, in both cases the in Sim calibrations provided better
predictions for chl-a with slopes of the 2 June validation trend line closer to the 1:1
1ine compared to the HICO calibrations (HICO linear RMSE: 4.1 ng/L vs. in Sim linear
RMSE: 3.76 ng/L; and HICO polynomial RMSE: 4.98 ng/L vs. in Sim polynomial
RMSE: 4.22 pg/L) (Figures 9 and 10). This could be due to two factors: (1) error
observed in the atmospheric correction algorithm in the red—NIR wavelength and (2)
reduced sensitivity in HICO data to changing chl-a concentrations in red—NIR wave—
lengths (Figures 7 and 8). Comparing all the validations, it was clear that the polynomial
coefﬁcients given in Mishra and Mishra (2012) provided the best predictive accuracy for

8 coefﬁcients given in Mishra and Mishra (2012) which were derived from a calibration
: dataset comprising of wide geographic settings and water quality parameters. Once again,

o . . .
Q June and 26 August) (Table 4a and b). HICO NDCI for each sampling location was ass1gned a
chl-a concentration range based on the NDCI and chl-a relationship provided in Table 6 of
Mishra and Mishra (2012). Qualitative predictions were then compared with the measured
chl-a and quantitatively predicted chl-a using the best model. For the 2 June HICO data, only
one location received wrong estimation with 92% accuracy in chl-a prediction (Table 4a). For
the 26 August HICO data, three locations received wrong estimation with 77% accuracy in
chl-a prediction (Table 4b). These ﬁndings were consistent with the quantitative validations
for the two dates, where 26 August validation produced higher RMSE error compared to the 2
June validation (as given in Figure 10a and b). The NDCIQuahtative validation consistently
performed very well during both HyperSAS and HICO validation process revealing the utility
of NDCI for water quality research and for monitoring waters at locations with limited ﬁeld
observations. This important outcome provided an alternative toward traditional empirical
algorithm approaches for water quality monitoring.

8 4.5. NDCI map composites analysis
Maps of color-coded NDCI and chl-a distribution for PB and CB were prepared for the
three available HICO images and compared (Figure 12). Although a strong correspon-
dence in spatial distribution was observed between NDCI and chl-a in all the three cases,
the same correspondence did not hold true Visually. That is because of the narrow range of
chl-a concentration (low level) found in the study area. The same was evidenced in the
NDCI range which was 0.027 to —0.258 for June and —0.009 to —0.221 for August in PB
data and 0.126 to —0.174 for July in CB data. This low range of NDCI yielded three
corresponding ranges of chl-a concentration and hence the three color codes in the maps
(Table 4a and b). Therefore, even with a strong quantitative correspondence between
NDCI and chl-a values, the Visual correspondence was minimal (Figure 12). Higher
NDCI resulted in higher chl-a concentration and, these areas were mainly situated in
the northern PB and eastern CB areas at the river mouths. Chl-a levels were slightly

were much higher compared to PB in either June or August. Overall, the chl-a levels for
both study sites were relatively low compared to most of the estuarine systems in south-
east United States. Maps of spatial distribution of chl-a using NDCIQualitaﬁve were not
prepared because the low concentration of chl-a at both sites on the three dates would

5. Conclusion
It is eVident from the above analysis that NDCI can be effectively used as a qualitative
and quantitative chl-a monitoring tool. In addition, the need for site-speciﬁc validation
may be reduced when using the NDCI qualitatively. The calibration coefﬁcients and the
relationship between NDCI and chl-a range proposed in Mishra and Mishra (2012)
performed well on both HyperSAS and HICO datasets for the two new study sites.
NDCI-based water quality mapping can be used on various satellite sensors such as
HICO, Hyperion, MERIS, Sentinel 2, and Sentinel 3 or any other future sensors with
the necessary bands available. We have successfully tested NDCI on waters with rela-
tively low to moderate chl-a concentrations (2 to <15 ng/L). Therefore, it can be
concluded that NDCI is able to map the spatiotemporal variability of phytoplankton
distribution accurately for a wide variety of waters starting from low chl-a (<7.5 ug/L)
3 open ocean to moderate chl-a (7.5—25 ug/L) near-costal to high chl-a (25—50 ug/L) inland
8 water to extremely high chl-a (>50 ug/L) agricultural ponds such as catﬁsh pond waters.
E This research also shows for the ﬁrst time that HICO is an excellent high spectral
0;) resolution sensor for periodic mapping of chl-a in coastal waters. Because satellite-based,
: hyperspectral data have been rarely available for scientiﬁc investigations, HICO has the
([2 potential to be a valuable monitoring tool due to its high spectral and spatial resolutions
l0, and corresponding ability to obtain spectral data near the land—water interface, where
[5 water quality managers continue to focus and humans may have the high probability of
E interacting with the aquatic environment.
