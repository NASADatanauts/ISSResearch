Study of Cylindrical Dusty Plasmas in PK—4J; Experiments
Kazuo TAKAHASHI 1, Manami TONOUCHI 1, Satoshi ADACHI 2 and Hiroo TOTSUJI 2
Abstract
Dusty plasmas have been studied under microgravity with utilities boarding 0n the International Space Station in a joint Russian/German
research project. Dynamics of dust particles in cylindrical plasmas is investigated in the next term of the proj ect with the apparatus of PK—4. A
research team in Japan studied the cylindrical dusty plasmas to contribute to the project with the PK—4J similar to the original one and
developed for microgravity experiments of parabolic ﬂights in Japan. The dust particles distributed in the off-centered position close to the
bottom in balancing of gravity. They changed the distribution and moved to around the center aXis in a cylindrical discharge under
microgravity. Several particles arranged in a line parallel to the aXis, and the lines piled up to a bundle in the discharge.
Keyword(s): dusty plasma, complex plasma, microgravity, parabolic ﬂight experiment, PK—4, PK—4J
