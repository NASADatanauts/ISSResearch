We study phase separation in a deeply quenched colloid-polyrner mixture in microgravity 0n the
International Space Station using small-angle light scattering and direct imaging. We Observe a Clear
crossover from early-stage spinodal decomposition to 1ate-stage, interfacial-tension-driven coarsening.
Data acquired over 5 orders of magnitude in time show more than 3 orders of magnitude increase in
domain size, following nearly the same evolution as that in binary liquid mixtures. The late-stage growth
approaches the expected linear growth rate quite slowly.
