Abstract
Objective: To assess the potential of electrical impedance myography (EIM) to serve as a marker of muscle fiber atrophy and
secondarily as an indicator of bone deterioration by assessing the effects of spaceﬂight or hind limb unloading. Methods: In the
first experiment, 6 mice were ﬂown aboard the space shuttle (STS—135) for 13 days and 8 earthbound mice served as controls. In
the second experiment, 14 mice underwent hind limb unloading (HLU) for 13 days; 13 additional mice served as controls. EIM
measurements were made on ex vivo gastrocnemius muscle. Quantitative microscopy and areal bone mineral density (aBMD)
measurements of the hindlimb were also performed. Results: Reductions in the multifrequency phase—slope parameter were ob—
served for both the space ﬂight and HLU cohorts compared to their respective controls. For ground control and spaceﬂight groups,
the values were 24.7il.30/MHZ and 14.1:1.6°/MHZ, respectively (p=0.0013); for control and HLU groups, the values were
23.9il.60/MHZ and l9.0il.0°/MHZ, respectively (p=0.014). This parameter also correlated with muscle fiber size (p=0.65,
p=0.011) for spaceﬂight and hind limb aBMD (p=0.65, p=0.0063) for both groups. Conclusions: These data support the concept
that EIM may serve as a useful tool for assessment of muscle disuse secondary to immobilization or microgravity.
