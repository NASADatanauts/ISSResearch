Abstract
There is evidence that space ﬂight condition—induced biological damage is associated with increased oxidative stress and extracellular matrix
3 (ECM) remodeling. To explore possible mechanisms, changes in gene expression proﬁles implicated in oxidative stress and in ECM remode—
é ling in mouse skin were examined after space ﬂight. The metabolic effects of space ﬂight in skin tissues were also characterized. Space Shuttle
g Atlantis (STS—135) was launched at the Kennedy Space Center on a 13—day mission. Female C57BL/6 mice were ﬂown in the STS—135 using
8 animal enclosure modules (AEMs). Within 3—5 h after landing, the mice were euthanized and skin samples were harvested for gene array
g analysis and metabolic biochemical assays. Many genes responsible for regulating production and metabolism of reactive oxygen species
j§ (ROS) were signiﬁcantly (p < 0.05) altered in the ﬂight group, with fold changes >1.5 compared to AEM control. For ECM proﬁle, several
