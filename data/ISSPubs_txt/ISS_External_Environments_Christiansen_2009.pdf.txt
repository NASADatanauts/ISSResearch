Abstract
This paper describes the International Space Station (ISS) micrO-meteoroid orbital debris (MMOD) impact shielding including
the requirements for protection as well as technical approaches to meeting the requirements. Current activities in providing
MMOD protection for ISS are described, including efforts to augment MMOD protection by adding shields on-Orbit. Another
activity is to Observe MMOD impact damage on ISS elements and returned hardware, and to compare the Observed damage
With predicted damage using Bumper code risk assessment software. A conclusion of this paper is that ISS Will be protected
adequately from MMOD impact after completing augmentation of ISS shielding for service module, and after improving MMOD
protection for Soyuz and Progress vehicles. Another conclusion is that impact damage observed to the ISS mini-pressurized
logistics module matches the distribution of impacts predicted by Bumper code.
