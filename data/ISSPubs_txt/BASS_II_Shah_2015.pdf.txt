Combustion of clear cast polymethylmethacrylate (PMMA) samples 10 cm long by either 1 or 2 cm wide with thicknesses ranging
from 1-5 mm was investigated in opposed ﬂow. Tests included both one sided and two sided bums. The samples were burned in a
ﬂow duct within the Microgravity Science Glovebox (MSG) 0n the International Space Station (188) to ensure true microgravity
conditions. The experiment took place in opposed ﬂow with a varying oxygen concentration (uncontrolled) and varying ﬂow
velocities (controlled). F lames are recorded on two cameras and later tracked to determine spread rate.
Assuming a linear proﬁle between oxygen concentration at the start and the end of each test we made graphs of oxygen concentration
vs. time for each test. F rom these we created ﬂammability maps showing the ﬂame behavior at different oxygen concentrations and
ﬂow velocities. Additionally we have conducted an extinction analysis, plotting the oxygen concentration against the ﬂow velocity at
the time of extinction with respect to type of test (one sided or two sided). Currently we are modeling combustion of ﬂat PMMA
samples in microgravity using F ire Dynamic Simulator (FDS 5.5.3). The entire modeling for BASS-II is done in DNS mode because
of the laminar conditions and small domain. The model employs the same test sample and MSG geometry as the experiment. The
model predicts a higher ﬂame spread rate than that observed in experiments. So we look to modify the chemical kinetics and materials
properties to improve the model. Also we plan to do a domain study and grid sensitivity analysis in future.
1. Introduction
The NASA Burning and Suppression of Solids-II (BASS 11) experiments examine the combustion of different solid
materials and geometries in microgravity. While ﬂames in microgravity are driven by diffusion and weak advection due
to crew movements and ventilation, the current NASA spacecraft material selection test method (NASA-STD-éOOl Test
1) [l] is driven by buoyant forces since gravity is present. So the Bass 11 results will be used in comparison with ground
based experimental setups aimed at replacing NASA’s current test method for screening materials used onboard
spacecraft. The data gathered will also help us understand and know more about behavior of ﬁres in space so that space
travel can be made safer in future. The BASS 11 experiments have provided us with an extensive thick fuel microgravity
database which did not eXist previously. Previously thick fuel true microgravity data was obtained by S. Olson and
others in a study involving Sounding Rocket experiments [2]. The study comprised of a series of combustion
experiments on PMMA at very low velocity opposed ﬂow and external radiant ﬂux.
The institutions taking part in BASS 11 operations are Case Western Reserve University, University of California
Berkley, NASA Glenn Research Center and San Diego State University [3]. There are three categories of samples: ﬂat

samples, rod samples, and a section of a large solid sphere. The ﬂat sample materials will include acrylic ﬁlms and
sheets of different thicknesses, and a cotton—ﬂberglass fabric blend Solid Inﬂammability Boundary at Low—Speeds
(SIBAL) fuel. The rod samples are made of black or clear acrylic, and will provide solid fuel regression rates and
extinction limits for both opposed and concurrent ﬂow. The large solid spherical section, also made of acrylic, will be
used to study ignition of thick materials and ﬂame growth over the thick material.

The BASS—II hardware comprises of a small ﬂow duct with an igniter and a small nozzle along with exchangeable fuel
samples. The BASS II ﬂow duct is placed inside the Microgravity Science Glove box (MSG) (255 liters) [5] on board
the International Space Station (188). A radiometer placed at the top measures the intensity of the ﬂame. A fan is used to
produce forced ﬂow of air in the duct. Also present is an anemometer which measures the velocity of air entering into the
duct. A Nikon digital camera looks through the top of the ﬂow duct normal to the sample surface and a high deﬁnition
Video camera uses a mirror to look through the front door of the duct at the edge of the sample.
A total of 20 PMMA Polymethylmethacrylate (PMMA) samples were burnt during the BASS II experimentation .The
sample thickness varied from 1mm — 5 mm thick .The samples burnt were all either 1 0r 2 cm wide. All the bums are
either 1 sided or two sided. The air ﬂow was always opposed. Air ﬂow speeds ranging from as low as 3 cm/s up to 20
cm/s were used in the ﬂow duct.
Prior to the start of testing at each session, a crewmember installs the hardware in MSG. The fan calibration is set before
the ﬂame is ignited. Once ignited the ﬂame is allowed to stabilize at ﬁrst and then the airﬂow is adjusted throughout the
test. Fan speed, radiometer reading and the time is monitored during the entire test. The airﬂow is turned off after the
test. Videos and data are downlinked to earth [3]. The still images and Videos from the data are tracked using Spotlight —
16 (NASA image tracking software) [6]. Data are then imported to Excel to obtain ﬂame spread rates. A graph of the
position vs time for one of the tests is given below. The black line in the plot represents the oxygen concentration proﬁle
during the duration of the test. A secondary Y aXis shows the oxygen concentration in percent by volume. The red
portion on the graphs represents the part of experiment where the opposed ﬂow velocity was 10 cm/s. Similarly the
green and purple regions represent ﬂow speeds of 6 cm/s and 5 cm/s respectively.

Figure 3: Flame images from the BASS —11 Experiments
Above are some of the ﬂame still images taken by the Nikon camera during experiments. The purpose of arranging the
pictures by keeping a constant ﬂow velocity and increasing the sample thickness was to show the varied nature of ﬂames
Obtained by just altering some parameters. Differences in oxygen concentration could be the reason why the ﬂames in
M8 and M5 appear different from the others.
3. Oxygen Concentration Analysis
The BASS Hardware does not have a provision to measure oxygen concentration throughout the entire experiment. We
have oxygen data available at only the start and end of the test. Assuming a linear proﬁle between these two points; we
made oxygen concentration graphs for each test (see Fig. 2, for example). This helps us know the oxygen concentration
at any given time during the experiment. Next, the average oxygen concentration was calculated for each ﬂow speed and
then we made average oxygen concentration (% by volume) vs Opposed ﬂow speed (cm/s) plots summarizing the one-
sided and two sided tests separately. The data points on these graphs are characterized according to the ﬂame spread rate.
Additionally the data points at which the ﬂame extinguishes are also added to the summary graphs to see the effects of
varying oxygen concentration though the duration of test. This analysis will serve as a reference point when more BASS
Operations are conducted in future.
4. Numerical Modeling
We are modeling combustion of ﬂat PMMA samples in microgravity using Fire Dynamics Simulator (FDS v5.5.3) [7]
which is a computational ﬂuid dynamics model of ﬁre driven ﬂuid ﬂow. The entire modeling for BASS—II is done in
DNS mode because of the laminar conditions and small domain. The model employs the same test sample and MSG
geometry as the experiment. The results are Viewed in Smokeview, which is a Visualization package that goes with FDS.
The experimental data gave upstream velocity at several points using an anemcmeter [8]. A ﬂow proﬁle for the inlet
velocity is Obtained using Matlab and input into the model (note that the measured ﬂow proﬁle for the BASS II duct is
quite irregular. The image below shows the geometry setup for the model

Figure 5: Smokeview Heat Release Rate in kW/m2
For this case the fuel sample used was 3mm thick. The averaged opposed ﬂow rate is lOcm/s. A grid size of 0.389 mm
in the X direction and 0.376 mm in the Z direction was used for the computation. At the start of simulation we have only
cold ﬂow. The ﬂow is allowed to stabilize for 1second of simulation time and then the igniter is turned on. It is on for
around 5 seconds and then ramped down and ﬁnally turned off. The maximum heat release rate obtained in the
simulation was 225 kW/mz. Smokeview can also be used to obtain quantities like temperature, mass ﬂux, net heat ﬂux
etc.

Figure 6: Average oxygen concentration vs Opposed ﬂow velocity summary graph (two sided burns)
In the graph above the hollow circles represent 1 cm wide tests and the solid circles represent the 2 cm wide tests. The
data points enclosed by purple triangle indicate that the spread rate for that ﬂow velocity was not perfectly linear. The
larger the symbol greater is the ﬂame spread rate at that opposed velocity. Crosses represent the data points at which
extinction occurs. Also you will notice that as the opposed ﬂow rate increases so does the spread rate which is evident by
the larger circles we see. The extinction occurs at the lowest ﬂow speed in each of the experiments.
Currently we have formed summary graphs for lsided and 2 sided BASS 11 experiments which show certain behaviors.
Shown below is a summary graph for 2 sided burns with data from the model as well.

Figure 7: Flame spread rate vs opposed ﬂow velocity (two sided tests).
As you see the graph illustrates that the higher the ﬂow velocity, or the thinner the sample, the higher the spread rate is.
The triangles represent the two model data points Which show a much higher spread rate than experiments [9, 10]. On
further observation we can see that the plot exhibits a clear Width effect. For thin fuels (1mm thick), especially, the 20m
Wide samples show a higher spread rate than the 1 cm Wide samples. This Will deﬁnitely help researchers decide sample
sizes for future planned experimentation aboard 188.

Figure 8: Flame spread rate vs opposed ﬂow speed (one sided tests)
The single sided samples burned a lot more slowly than the two sided samples, and also needed a higher opposed ﬂow
rate to keep burning. So far we have not ran any case with just one sided burning in the model so the graph does not
show any data points from model.
6. Conclusions
The BASS experiments gave some of the ﬁrst ever data regarding combustion of thick fuels in microgravity. The two
sided summary graphs do show that for thin fuels sample width affects the spread rate. In general the ﬂames spread
faster for two sided burns compared to one sided burns. The greater the thickness of the fuel the greater is the time taken
for the ﬂame to spread and so the lower is the spread rate. This is clearly evident in the different thicknesses that we have
tested. The model currently predicts much higher spread rates than those obtained in the experiment. We need to modify
chemical kinetics and material properties to improve model accuracy and results.
