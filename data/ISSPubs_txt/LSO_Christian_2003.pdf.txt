[1] The Optical Transient Detector (OTD) is a space-based instrument speciﬁcally
designed to detect and locate lightning discharges as it orbits the Earth. This instrument is
a scientiﬁc payload 0n the MicroLab-l satellite that was launched into a 700 inclination
10w Earth orbit in April 1995. Given the orbital trajectory of the satellite, most regions of
the Earth are observed by the OTD instrument more than 400 times during a 1 year period,
and the average duration of each observation is 2 min. The OTD instrument optically
detects lightning ﬂashes that occur within its 1300 x 1300 km2 ﬁeld of View during both
day and night conditions. A statistical examination of OTD lightning data reveals that
nearly 1.4 billion ﬂashes occur annually over the entire Earth. This annual ﬂash count
translates to an average of 44 i 5 lightning ﬂashes (intracloud and cloud-to-ground
combined) occurring around the globe every second, which is well below the traditional
estimate of 100 ﬂ s_1 that was derived in 1925 from world thunder day records. The range
of uncertainty for the OTD global totals represents primarily the uncertainty (and
variability) in the ﬂash detection efﬁciency of the instrument. The OTD measurements
have been used to construct lightning climatology maps that demonstrate the geographical
and seasonal distribution of lightning activity for the globe. An analysis of this annual
lightning distribution conﬁrms that lightning occurs mainly over land areas, with an
average land/ocean ratio of ~1021. The Congo basin, which stands out year-round, shows
a peak mean annual ﬂash density of 80 ﬂ km—2 yr—1 in Rwanda, and includes an area of
over 3 million km2 exhibiting ﬂash densities greater than 30 ﬂ knf2 yr_1 (the ﬂash
density of central Florida). Lightning is predominant in the northern Atlantic and western
Paciﬁc Ocean basins year-round where instability is produced from cold air passing over
warm ocean water. Lightning is less frequent in the eastern tropical Paciﬁc and Indian
Ocean basins where the air mass is warmer. A dominant Northern Hemisphere summer
peak occurs in the annual cycle, and evidence is found for a tropically driven semiannual
cycle. INDEX T ERMS: 3304 Meteorology and Atmospheric Dynamics: Atmospheric electricity; 3309
