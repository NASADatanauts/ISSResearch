ABSTRACT: The mechanism underlying space ﬂight—induced osteopenia is un-
known. In osteoblasts, the inducible nitric oxide (NO) synthase (iNOS) is in-
volved in the early response to mechanical strain and induction of apoptosis.
GTP cyclohydrolase I (GTPCH) is a key enzyme that is essential for iNOS ac-
tivity. The coordinate expression of GTPCH prevents apoptosis that is induced
by iNOS/NO. The purpose of this study was to investigate the effects of space
ﬂight on the expression of apoptotic/anti-apoptotic molecules iNOS and
GTPCH in rat osteoblasts. Rat osteoblasts were cultured aboard a space shut-
tle and solubilized 0n the 4th and 5th days of the mission. The mRNA levels for
iNOS and GTPCH in the ﬂight cultures were increased to at least 120-fold and
threefold higher than the ground (1 X g) controls, respectively. The amount of
cellular DNA per ﬂight culture vessel was 53% and 58% 0f the ground controls
on the 4th and 5th days, respectively. However, the increasing rate of the DNA
amount from the 4th to the 5th day was not different between the ﬂight cultures
and the ground controls. Morphologically, the cells grew in space as well as on
the ground. Co-eXpression 0f GTPCH and iNOS may indicate a self—protective
mode of action in osteoblasts against the harmful stress under microgravity.

INTRODUCTION
It is well documented that space ﬂight conditions change the function of osteo-
blasts in vivo and in vitro. We previously showed cytokine production in rat osteo-
blast culture was greatly enhanced during space ﬂight.1 A report indicated that pro-
inﬂammatory cytokines stimulated co-expression of GTP cyclohydrolase I

(GTPCH) and inducible nitric oxide (NO) synthase (iNOS) in mouse osteoblastie
cells.2 GTPCH is the rate-limiting enzyme for de novo synthesis of tetrahydrobiop-
terin (BH4) that is the eo-faetor for iNOS.3 Endogenous NO plays important roles in
osteoblasts, not only for cell proliferation and function,4 but also for induction of ap-
optosis.5 In the former case, induction of NO and iNOS is an early response of os-
teoblasts to mechanical strain.6 In the latter case, eo-eXpression of GTPCH with
iNOS mRNAs prevented the NO-indueed apoptotie changes in osteoblasts.2 This is
the first report on the eo-eXpression of iNOS with GTPCH in rat osteoblasts that
were cultured aboard a space shuttle.
MATERIALS AND METHODS

Primary culture of osteoblasts was prepared from male Wistar rat femur mar-
rows.1 Cells were inoculated into ﬂight culture vessels at a density of 104/cm2 three
days before launch. Cells were cultured continuously for four and five days aboard
a space shuttle.1 On the third day of the mission, cells were treated with 1 nM of
loc,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 for one day, then solubilized with guanidine isothiocy-
anate solution on the fourth day (Experiment I). The entire process of the operation
was repeated one day later during the space ﬂight (Experiment 11). Morphological
observation was also conducted during the spaceﬂight by using a phase-eontrast mi-
croscope. The ground (l x g) control samples were synchronized with ﬂight cultures
under conditions identical except for microgravity: the latent hours at 22 ~ 25°C
before the ﬂight incubator was activated at 37°C and a 30-min exposure to 2 ~ 3 x g
to simulate the hypergraVity that was generated by shuttle lift off.

After the return to Earth, cellular RNA and DNA in each culture were purified
separately for examining the mRNA levels and the amount of cellular DNA (indica-
tor of cell proliferation).1 The mRNA levels of iNOS and GTPCH were analyzed by
semiquantitative RT-PCR, using gene-speeifie primers7: GTPCH forward 5’-
GGATACCAGGAGACCATCTCA-3’; GTPCH reverse 5’-TAGCATGGTGCTAGT-
GACAGT-3’; iNOS forward 5’-CTGCAGGTCTTTGACGCTCGG-3’; iNOS reverse
5’-CTGGAACACAGGGGTGATGCT-3’. Data were normalized against the house-
keeping gene glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase.1

RESULTS AND DISCUSSION

The GTPCH mRNA levels in the ﬂight cultures were threefold higher than the
ground controls on the fourth day of the mission (FIG. 1A). On the fifth day, the
GTPCH mRNA levels in the ﬂight cultures were further increased to siX- to eightfold
higher than the ground control (FIG. 1A). The iNOS gene transcripts were not detect-
ed at all in two of the four ground controls even after RT-PCR (FIG. 1B). On the con-
trary, the iNOS mRNA levels in the ﬂight cultures were increased to l20-fold and
180-fold higher than the remaining two ground controls on the fourth and fifth days
(FIG. 1B). As for the mechanism of coordinate increase of GTPCH and iNOS expres-
sion, positive regulation by CAMP and NF-KB might be involved at the transcription-
al level.2 We observed upregulation of eAMP/adenylate eyelase in osteoblasts under
microgravity (unpublished data).

Morphologically, 0n the fourth day of the mission, cells in the ﬂight cultures as
well as in the ground controls had grown to the preconﬂuent phase, showing no se-
rious impairment or cell death (FIG. 2A). The total amount of cellular DNA in the
ﬂight cultures was 53% and 58% as small as the ground controls on the fourth and
fifth days (FIG. 2B). However, the increasing rate of DNA amount per ﬂight culture
vessel (an indicator of cell proliferation) was not different from the ground controls
from the fourth to the fifth day (FIG. 2B).1 Collectively, data suggested that growth
inhibition or apoptosis might be induced in the early days of space ﬂight but recov-
ered later during the mission.

Although endogenous NO induced apoptosis in osteoblasts,5 coordinate expres-
sion of GTPCH With iNOS protected against apoptosis that was induced by NO in
osteoblasts.2 On the other hand, another report addressed the physiological signifi-
cance of endogenous NO as an important regulator of osteoblastic cell proliferation
and function.4 In addition, iNOS/NO inhibited apoptosis by S—nitrosylation and in-
activation of caspase.8 We have not determined Whether the upreguation of iNOS/
NO is the apoptotic 0r anti-apoptotic feature in osteoblasts under microgravity. Data
were not statistically analyzed owing to limited amounts of RNA samples for the
ﬂight cultures. However, our repeated spaceﬂight experiments and the reproducible
results strongly suggested that microgravity markedly increased the mRNA levels
for GTPCH and iNOS in rat osteoblasts. Microgravity may modulate apoptotic and/
or anti-apoptotic molecules in osteoblasts. Further studies are needed to examine the
possible induction of apoptosis in an early phase of spaceﬂight and clarify the mech-
anism for iNOS and GTPCH induction under microgravity.
