Abstract
The Microgravity Science Glovebox (MSG) and Maintenance Work Area (MWA) are facilities aboard the International Space
Station (188) have been successfully used to conduct experiments in support of, respectively, the Pore Formation and Mobility
Investigation (PFMI) and the In—Space Soldering Investigation (1881). The capabilities of these facilities are brieﬂy discussed
and then demonstrated by presenting “real—time” and subsequently down linked Video—taped examples from the abovementioned
experiments. Data interpretation, ISS telescience, some lessons learned, and the need of such facilities for conducting work in
support of understanding materials’ behavior, particularly ﬂuid processing and transport scenarios, in low—gravity environments,
is discussed.
