ABSTRACT
This paper presents an analysis of the sensitivity Changes experienced by three of the eight sensors that comprise
the Remote Atmospheric and Ionospheric Detection System (RAIDS) after more than a year operating on board
the International Space Station (188). These sensors are the Extreme Ultraviolet Spectrograph (EUVS) that
covers 550—1100 A, the Middle Ultraviolet (MUV) spectrometer that covers 1900—3100 A, and the Near Infrared
Spectrometer (NIRS) that covers 7220—8740 A. The scientiﬁc goal for RAIDS is comprehensive remote sensing of
the temperature, composition, and structure of the lower thermosphere and ionosphere from 85—200 km. RAIDS
was installed on the 188 J apanese Expansion Module External Facility (J EM—EF) in September of 2009. After
initial Checkout the sensors began routine operations that are only interrupted for sensor safety by occasional
ISS maneuvers as well as a few days per month when the orbit imparts a risk from exposure to the Sun. This
history of measurements has been used to evaluate the rate of degradation of the RAIDS sensors exposed to an
environment with signiﬁcant sources of particulate and molecular contamination. The RAIDS EUVS, including
both contamination and detector gain sag, has shown an overall signal loss rate of 0.2% per day since the start
of the mission, with an upper boundary of 0.13% per day attributed solely to contamination effects. This upper
boundary is driven by uncertainty in the Change in the emission ﬁeld due to Changing solar conditions, and there
is strong evidence that the true loss due to contamination is signiﬁcantly smaller. The MUV and NIRS have

shown stability to within 1% over the ﬁrst year of operations.

1. INTRODUCTION

RAIDS is a suite of eight instruments designed to provide comprehensive measurements of terrestrial airglow
from 550 to 8740 A. The component sensors include two spectrographs to cover the extreme (550—1100 A) and
far ultraviolet (1300—1800 A), three spectrometers to measure the middle (2000—3000 A) and near ultraviolet
(3000—4000 A) as well as the near— infrared (7220—8740 A), and three photometers centered on 7774, 7650, and
6300 A. These sensors were designed and developed several decades ago for near—Earth space weather remote
sensing1 and are now ﬁnally in operation Via the unique opportunity afforded by the International Space Station
(1881274 The RAIDS experiment was launched and installed aboard the J apanese Experiment Module (Kibo)
Exposed Facility (J EM—EF) 0n the 188 in September 2009. RAIDS began collecting routine science data in mid—
October after initial sensor checkout and operations tests. The sensors View in the orbital plane toward the limb
in the wake direction from the 188. The primary scientiﬁc goals of the RAIDS mission focused on measuring the
temperature of the lower thermosphere (100—200 km) using the near—infrared 02 Atmospheric Band emissions
near 7650 A,5 and measurement of photoionization processes in the lower thermosphere that can be used in
advanced ionospheric remote sensing algorithms.6

During the design phase of the RAIDS mission, signiﬁcant concern was raised about the contamination
environment surrounding the ISS and what impact this would have on the lifetime of the RAIDS sensors.

Figure 1. Total spectral counts obtained by the RAIDS EUVS in comparison to observations at initial turn—on 27 October
2009. The line shows the ﬁt to the median value for each day, marked With the red diamonds, versus day number from
the reference day. For each point the ISS beta angle was near 250 and the line of sight corresponded to a tangent altitude
between 145—150 km. Solar activity was similar throughout the range of days presented here.
Tools exist to make estimates of the risk to sensor optics,7 and observations have been made on the general
contamination environment as it pertains to the integrity of the ISS structure.8 However, it was unclear What
could be expected at the newly installed J EM—EF location on the ISS, as well as What the true impact would be
on science experiments that have unique conﬁgurations and requirements. In addition, the RAIDS payload was
oriented to View in the anti—rarn and nadir directions, preventing any direct access of particulate contamination
through the sensor apertures. Because the primary concern focused on the sensor measuring in the extreme—
ultraviolet Where contamination is most problematic, much of the focus in the current analysis is on this sensor
With survey—level checks on the remaining sensors.
2. EXTREME ULTRAVIOLET SPECTROGRAPH
The RAIDS extreme—ultraviolet spectrograph (EUVS) is an f/ 5 near—Wadsworth concave grating spectrograph.
The instrument rotates the grating between one of two positions to focus either the 550—850 A or 770—1100 A
spectral range onto the detector. The detector is comprised of three bare microchannel plates stacked in a
Z—shaped conﬁguration With a wedge—and—strip anode. The 2—dimensional image on the detector is summed in
the cross—dispersion direction to provide an one—dimensional 128—pixel spectrum every 0.5 s as the Viewing angle
is Changed by the motion of the scan platform. A non—herrnetic plunger door sealed the detector compartment
to prevent contamination prior to launch. This door opened With the ﬁrst motion of the EUVS grating motor
and cannot be Closed in—ﬂight. In addition, a spring—loaded dust—cover over the telescope aperture opened With
the ﬁrst motion of the scan platform. The EUVS grating holder is equipped With a small heater that maintains
the optical surface at an elevated temperature during sensor operation in comparison to the surrounding cavity
to prevent outgassing volatiles from condensing 0n the grating surface.

The primary Challenge With evaluating contamination effects in the EUVS sensor is distinguishing Changes
in responsivity due to deposition of hydrocarbons 0n the optical surfaces from loss due to gain sag in the
microchannel plate in regions Where bright airglow features appear. Further complicating the issue is the fact
that an absolute, in—ﬂight calibration of the EUVS sensor is difﬁcult to construct. Typically this is determined
using measured spectra of well—Characterized, hot, UV stars that pass through the sensor ﬁeld of View. However,
the RAIDS experiment is typically operating in a mode that is not conducive to the monitoring of stars due
to the iteration between staring and scanning that drives the primary science goals. In addition, this method
cannot be used shortward of about 912 A Where interstellar hydrogen absorbs the stellar emissions, thus allowing
only an indirect calculation of the responsivity for a large fraction of the EUVS passband. Because of this, our

analysis has focused on the raw counts within the EUVS spectrum to directly evaluate Changes in the sensor
responsivity.

In order to better separate contamination and gain sag effects, a campaign was designed in which the sen—
sor was powered off for an extended period to allow for evaluation of only environmental impacts to sensor
performance. Afterward, an identical time period was used as a control test during which the sensor operated
continuously and the data evaluated and compared to the unpowered test. The duration of each test period was
determined by operational constraints of the RAIDS experiment. The precession 0f the beta angle, deﬁned as
the angle between the orbital plane and the Earth—Sun vector, was such that a similar observing geometry is set
up on the order of once a month. In addition, the RAIDS sensors must be shut down as the orbit approaches
a beta angle of zero degrees to avoid having the sensors accidentally View the Sun. To ensure this time period
was sufﬁcient to observe any sensor Changes, a survey was conducted of the cumulative loss—rate 0f the total
counts in the sensor over the initial year of sensor operation. Spectra were collected from a series of dates and
nearly—identical observing conditions. Solar activity was essentially unchanged during this time with the solar
F107 index ranging from 73 to 82. Solar zenith angles at the tangent point were set by the ISS beta angle that

was constrained to range from 23—27 degrees and Viewing altitudes were limited to 145—150 km tangent altitude.
The total counts in the spectra were summed for six observing periods determined to meet all these conditions
to ensure similar measurement expectations. A linear ﬁt to the median values, as shown in Figure 1, provided
a quantitative estimate of the observed loss rate of 0.2% per day with respect to the count rate observed at
ﬁrst turn—on in October 2009. Within the one month window that RAIDS might be expected to obtain contin—
uous data, the expected total loss based on this trend would be over 5% and should be detectable above the
uncertainties in the data.

The campaign commenced on 11 J anuary 2011. The ﬁrst phase, with the sensor off (”off—phase”), ended on
10 February 2011. The second phase, with the sensor on (”on—phase”), began on 9 March 2011 and ended on
9 April 2011. The sensor was in a conﬁguration pointed down toward the Earth’s disk for the duration of this
time. This was unfortunately caused by failure of the scan platform just prior to this test, but was fortuitous
for the purpose of this study. This is the nominal position for RAIDS during its Sun—safe period and ensured
that not only would the sensor avoid Sun damage but also ensured that signiﬁcant overlap of Viewing geometries
would occur regardless of the minor ISS attitude variations that might occur during the campaign. The EUVS
was placed in its long—wavelength position to determine the relative Changes in sensor responsivity across the
passband.

During this span of time in the ﬁrst few months of 2011, solar activity was much more variable than it
had been during the 2010 time frame, as evidenced by the solar EUV proxy F107 index ranging from 79.9 on
11 January, 87.3 on 10 February, up to 141.1 on 9 March, and 105.3 on 9 April. Thus, the measured spectra

will include both a combination of sensor responsivity Changes and Changes in illumination of the scene, even
for measurements at the same location and solar zenith angle (Viewing geometry). We have devised a method
for making a comparison of the RAIDS spectra across this range of activity by using airglow data obtained
by the Special Ultraviolet Limb Imager (SSULI) operating on the DMSP F18 satellite. This sensor measures
800—1400 A in a Sun—synohronous orbit near 0830 LT, and has been operating simultaneously with the RAIDS
mission. SSULI does obtain frequent stellar observations that allow it to provide routine in—ﬂight updates to its
calibration, thus providing the reference standard used to scale the RAIDS data. We used the 01 989 A feature
measured by SSULI to obtain a scale factor to adjust the RAIDS spectra for cross—Comparison between time
periods. This optically thick emission is relatively insensitive to composition Changes in the lower thermosphere.9
While this makes it a poor measure of the thermosphere, it does provide an excellent measure of Changes in the
EUV airglow spectrum driven by Changes in solar activity. It also is a prominent feature of the RAIDS EUVS
spectrum and thus directly connects the measurements.

Figure 2 shows the overlap in SSULI measurements and their proximity to the RAIDS measurements for
the off—phase. Although we used these results that optimized proximity in SZA, tests with data optimized for
geographical location produced nearly identical results. It is noted that the SSULI tracks overlap on these plots
due to the Sun—synchronous orbit. The 188, on the other hand, crosses the same location on the ascending and
descending orbit segments in successive 30—day spans. Figures 3 shows altitude proﬁles of the SSULI 989 A ratio
for the off—phase. The ratio is relatively uniform with altitude, consistent with an optically thick emission that
is not driven by Changes in composition, and can be Characterized by the mean value. Similarly, Figures 4 — 5
shows these same comparisons for the on—phase of the campaign.

Figure 6 shows a comparison of the RAIDS spectra during the off—phase, after application of the SSULI
989 A scale factor. It also shows the difference between these spectra, along with the uncertainty solely from
the measurement, extraction, and calibration of the SSULI 989 A feature. Nearly the entire spectrum is within
this uncertainty. In addition, there is no sign of any wavelength dependence, a signature that might be expected
from any loss due to optical contamination. Figure 7 shows a comparison of the RAIDS spectra during the
on—phase. Here, there is strong evidence for a loss in sensitivity over the span of the measurements as shown
by the difference between the spectra. The most prominent Changes are seen near the bright 834 A and 989 A
features, as well as across most of the longer wavelengths where several emission features exist. The contrasting
differences between the off—phase and on—phase test Clearly show that signiﬁcant loss is due to operation of the
sensor, indicative of gain—sag in the detector. Speciﬁcally, the biggest sensitivity Changes are isolated to regions
of the detector where the brightest emissions exist.

As a ﬁnal Check in this analysis, we completed a total count rate analysis on these two time periods during
the campaign, similar to that shown in Figure 1. During the on—phase, the loss was found to be 0.16% per day,

consistent With the 0.20% per day found in the initial study shown in Figure 1. Comparatively, the off—phase
showed < 0.01% per day total count loss. Given that our uncertainty in the scaling factor was 0.13% per day,
this represents a statistically insigniﬁcant Change. These numbers suggest that optical contamination Changes
the sensitivity in the 800—1100 A range has an upper limit of 0.13% per day, With a likely value smaller than
0.04% per day. Finally, it is noted that these numbers are applicable to sensors Viewing in the ram or nadir, and
located on the J EM—EF segment of the 188.
3. MIDDLE ULTRAVIOLET SPECTROMETER
The RAIDS middle—ultraviolet spectrometer (MUV) is an f / 5 Ebert—Fastie monochromator that covers the wave—
length range 1900—3170 A. The detector is a CsTe2 photomultiplier With a MgF2 Window. A Si02 Window at
the entrance slit to the monochromator is used to eliminate shorter wavelengths in higher orders. The MUV
spectrometer sensitivity can be monitored using the brightness of Rayleigh scattered sunlight. This method has
been useful in resolving shape ambiguities in the pre—ﬂight calibration curve due to uncertainties in calibration
lamp performance. However, the observed brightness of speciﬁc features is determined by several factors that
vary between limb scans, and With longer term variations due to Changes in the ISS orbital conﬁguration.

Figures 8 and 9 shows a sample of the complete analysis of the MUV spectrum. Both ﬁgures show limb
scans near 95 km tangent height, one from 8 J anuary 2010 and the other from 20 December 2010, nearly a year
apart. These ﬁgures show that the spectral shape of the pre—ﬂight calibration curve is reasonably accurate, in
that the RAIDS MUV spectra match the solar scattered spectrum very well in the regions With no atmospheric
emission. Note that although the retrieved NO column shown in the bottom panel is quite different in both
cases, this should not impact the ﬁt to the solar scattering region Where no atmospheric emissions exist. In fact,
a comparison of these plots shows that the sensitivity is relatively unchanged over this time period. It is also in
these regions Where our analysis can best determine any sensitivity losses due to contamination.

The primary factors governing the scattered light intensity are tangent altitude, solar zenith angle, and
scattering angle. Figure 10 shows an example of the Rayleigh scattered brightness measured between 2395—
2410 A as a function of tangent altitude. As can be seen in the spectra from Figures 8 and 9, this spectral
region does not contain any signiﬁcant interference from terrestrial airglow features. These data were obtained
over the course of about three days during March, 2010. Each point represents the mean intensity of a scaled
solar spectrum ﬁt to the observed RAIDS spectrum after applying the pre—ﬂight calibration and a small (roughly
10—15%) correction for stray light contamination. The dotted line represents a ﬁt to the RAIDS data and the
solid line is from a single scattering model With a density scale height of 5.8 km (average T of 192 K).

This example shows that over short periods, tangent height parameters and the observed brightness follow
the pattern expected based on a simple Rayleigh scattering model. It also emphasizes the need for accurate
pointing and altitude registration in order to use Rayleigh scattered brightness for sensitivity monitoring. For
example, a 1—km shift in tangent altitude translates approximately to a 20% Change in brightness. While this

observed scattered beam) between 30 and 50 degrees. These ranges in altitude, solar zenith angle, and scattering
angle were Chosen as a compromise between data quantity and consistency in factors controlling the scattered
brightness.

Also displayed in Figure 11 is the best ﬁt trend line, which suggests a small increase in sensitivity on the
order of 9% over the course of fourteen months. However, the uncertainty in the slope (dotted lines) does not
preclude the possibility for no Change in sensitivity that would be more in line with the physical realities of
such an optical sensor. One of the major difﬁculties with using this method for sensitivity monitoring is the
uncertainty in pointing and possible offsets tangent altitude parameters. It is believed to be an important cause
for the observed Changes in daily average brightness values. Another difﬁculty arises from the Changes in solar
zenith angle and scattering angle so that it is difﬁcult to obtain consistent values, such as might be possible from
a Sun—synchronous orbit. In any case, it is our conclusion that the MUV sensor shows no sensitivity Change, and
thus also demonstrates very little Change as a result of contamination.

4. NEAR INFRARED SPECTROMETER
The NIR spectrometer is an f/ 5 Ebert—Fastie monochromator consisting of an 1/8 meter telescope with bafﬂing,
off—axis spherical mirrors, transfer optics, an order sorting ﬁlter, photomultiplier detector, and electronics. The
25 mm2 grating and other optics are housed within the spectrometer. Photons are transferred Via ﬁber optic
cable from the main spectrometer unit to the detector that is located in a separate, passively cooled box mounted
near the exterior of the HREP structure.

The NIRS data are ﬁt using a synthetic spectrum comprised of all the signiﬁcant 02, N2, N3, and atomic
lines.5 In the normal operating mode, each day produced nearly 2000 spectra that were analyzed to determine
the intensity proﬁles, particularly of the ()2 emission bands. While temperature is determined by the shape of
the 02(0,0) emission band, the brightness has demonstrated a high level of consistency across several months
that is reﬂected in current models up to about 120 km.5 Although there is variability scan—to—scan, it is highly
probable that the scatter is a result of the pointing accuracies discussed in connection with the MUV analysis.
For the 02(0,0) emission, a 2 km altitude offset could result in a 20% intenstiy difference. However, the large
number of measurements will allow the data to reﬂect any long—term Changes in measured intensity over the
mission life despite any potential geophysical variability. Thus, we have used this emission to evaluate Changes
in the NIRS sensitivity.

"10","Figure 12 shows the total brightness of the 02(0,0) band as a function of the day of year in 2010 measured
at a constant tangent altitude of 120 km and a solar zenith angle between 35 and 45 degrees. A linear ﬁt to all
these data, weighted by the standard deviation of the measurement, is shown. The slope of this line shows a
loss of less than 0.03% per day. It cannot be ruled out that this extreme stability may in fact cover a potential
seasonal trend in the emission that has not yet been understood. Additional measurements and analysis beyond
the one—year timeframe might expose this. However, there is no indication in the data presented here of any
seasonal Changes within the single year of 2010. In addition, it is unlikely that such a pattern would exactly
offset a pattern of sensor degradation. Thus, we conclude that the NIRS has been unaffected by contamination
in the ISS environment.

5. SUMMARY

We have evaluated three of the RAIDS sensors, covering the extreme ultraviolet, middle ultraviolet, and near

infrared wavelengths, for sensitivity Changes that might be incurred by contamination of the optics while operating

in the ISS environment. None of the three sensors examined showed any detectable Change in sensitivity over the
one year of data examined. In each case, the analysis included an examination of the spectrum, or parts thereof,
as it Changed over time. Limiting data to speciﬁc ranges of observing conditions allowed the analysis to remove
potential Changes in the airglow. For the RAIDS EUVS, a novel concept was tested where the spectrum was
scaled using coincident measurements from another sensor to provide an offset that might result from changing
solar activity that drives the intensity of the key RAIDS spectral features. This method was successful in
determining not only an upper limit to the possible contamination effects, but also highlighted the magnitude
of the sensitivity loss from gain—sag in the EUVS microchannel plate detector for speciﬁc features. These results
can be used to more accurately estimate the true sensitivity of the RAIDS EUVS even absent stellar—baseol
calibration observations.
