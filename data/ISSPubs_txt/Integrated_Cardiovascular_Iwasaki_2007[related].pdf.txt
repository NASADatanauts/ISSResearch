Exposure to microgravity alters the distribution of body ﬂuids and the degree of distension of
cranial blood vessels, and these changes in turn may provoke structural remodelling and altered
cerebral autoregulation. Impaired cerebral autoregulation has been documented following
weightlessness simulated by head-down bed rest in humans, and is proposed as a mechanism
responsible for postspaceﬂight orthostatic intolerance. In this study, we tested the hypothesis that
spaceﬂight impairs cerebral autoregulation. We studied six astronauts N72 and 23 days before,
after 1 and 2 weeks in space (11 = 4), on landing day, and 1 day after the 16 day Neurolab space
shuttle mission. Beat-by-beat changes of photoplethysmographic mean arterial pressure and
transcranial Doppler middle cerebral artery blood ﬂow velocity were measured during 5 min
of spontaneous breathing, 30 mmHg lower body suction to simulate standing in space, and
10 min of 60 deg passive upright tilt on Earth. Dynamic cerebral autoregulation was quantiﬁed
by analysis of the transfer function between spontaneous changes of mean arterial pressure
and cerebral artery blood ﬂow velocity, in the very low- (0.02—0.07 Hz), low- (0.07—0.20 Hz) and
high-frequency (0.20—0.35 Hz) ranges. Resting middle cerebral artery blood ﬂow velocity did not
change signiﬁcantly from preﬂight values during or after spaceﬂight. Reductions of cerebral blood
ﬂow velocity during lower body suction were signiﬁcant before spaceﬂight (P < 0.05, repeated
measures ANOVA), but not during or after spaceﬂight. Absolute and percentage reductions of
mean (:I: S.E.M.) cerebral blood ﬂow velocity after 10 min upright tilt were smaller after than
before spaceﬂight (absolute, —4 :I: 3 cm s‘1 after versus — 14 :I: 3 cm s‘1 before, P = 0.001; and
percentage, —8.0 :I: 4.8% after versus —24.8 :I: 4.4% before,P < 0.05), consistent with improved
rather than impaired cerebral blood ﬂow regulation. Low-frequency gain decreased signiﬁcantly
(P < 0.05) by 26, 23 and 27% after 1 and 2 weeks in space and on landing day, respectively,
compared with preﬂight values, which is also consistent with improved autoregulation. We
conclude that human cerebral autoregulation is preserved, and possibly even improved, by
short-duration spaceﬂight.
