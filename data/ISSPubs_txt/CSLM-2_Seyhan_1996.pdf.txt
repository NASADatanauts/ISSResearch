"1","Ostwald Ripenmg of Sohd-Luqund Pb-Sn DisperSIons
I. SEYHAN, L. RATKE, W. BENDER, and P.W. VOORHEES
An experimental study on the inﬂuence of a ﬁnite volume fraction of solid on Ostwald ripening of
Pb-Sn dispersions is presented. Dispersions of lead panicles in a near—eutectic Pb—Sn liquid were
stabilized against gravitationally induced sedimentation by the use of Lorentz forces. The Lorentz
forces were induced by an electrical current within the samples and a magnetic ﬁeld perpendicular
to it. DiSpersions from 0.3 to 0.71 vol fraction solid Pb could thus be kept free of any large-scale
sedimentation for times of minutes to 15 hours. The results show that there is a deﬁnitive effect of
the volume fraction on the rate of coarsening and that the experimentally measured kinetics are in
close agreement with theoretical predictions. However, it is also clear that Lorentz forces accelerate
the coarsening process whenever a solid skeleton of the dispersoids is present. It is unclear if this
acceleration is also present in the experiments with a low volume fraction of solid.
