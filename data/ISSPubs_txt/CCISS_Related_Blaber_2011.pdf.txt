Astronauts W 1th Orthostatic Intolerance After Flight

Background and Purpose—We investigated cerebral blood ﬂow regulation in astronauts before and after ﬂights. We
hypothesized that autoregulation would be different before ﬂight and after ﬂight between nonfinishers and the finishers
of a stand test.

Methods—Twenty—seven astronauts from shuttle missions lasting 8 to 16 days underwent a 10—minute stand test: 10 days
before ﬂight, 1 to 2 hours and 3 days after landing. Mean blood ﬂow velocity of the middle cerebral artery (MCA) was
measured using transcranial Doppler; Mean arterial pressure was measured using a Finapres (Ohmeda, Englewood, CO)
and was adjusted to the level of the MCA (BPMCA). Cross—spectral power, gain, phase, and coherence were determined
for the relation between BPMCA and the cerebrovascular resistance indeX mean blood ﬂow velocity/BPMCA.

Results—BPMCA was reduced with stand (P<0.001). Differences between finishers and nonfinishers (P=0.011) and over
test days (P=0.004) were observed. Cerebrovascular conductance was affected by stand (P<0.001), by group
(P<0.001) with a group by stand, and test day interaction (P<0.01). Preﬂight data suggest that the nonfinishers were
operating at a higher cerebral vasodilation than finishers for a given BPMCA, and on landing day the nonfinishers had
a greater decrease in mean blood ﬂow velocity as a function of BPMCA with standing compared to finishers and preﬂight.
There was a significant interaction effect of gender over the test days and from supine to stand (P=0.035).

Conclusions—Our results indicate that the cause of presyncope in astronauts may be related to a mismatch of cerebral
blood ﬂow with blood pressure. Astronaut gender may also play a role in susceptibility to orthostatic intolerance after
ﬂight. (Stroke. 2011;42:1844-1850.)

"10","Astronauts were familiarized with the study protocol and data collection procedures 30 days pre-
ﬂight. Of the 40 original astronaut participants, 7 were excluded from analysis because they had
taken promethazine 0r dextroamphetamine within 12 h or caffeine within 4 h preceding the test
on landing day; siX could not be analyzed for cerebral autoregulation since on all the test days
either continuous blood pressure or cerebral blood ﬂow velocity data were not available.
Therefore, only 27 astronauts whose mean age was 38.7 i 5.2 yr, were used in our analysis.

The research protocol and cardiovascular data for these astronauts have already been
presented 1; however, the make-up of the astronauts used in this paper will not match exactly
those presented previously due to the requirement for complete and continuous data for blood
pressure and cerebral blood ﬂow velocity and no requirement for plasma eateeholamines.
Brieﬂy, all data were collected continuously, following a 10-minute supine set-up period. Data
were analyzed from 256 consecutive beats immediately following set-up and 30 seconds after the
astronaut was assisted to standing. From these segments the dynamic autoregulatory gain was
determined using the non-invasive transfer function method 2 along with the average cerebral
blood ﬂow velocity (MFV), blood pressure at brain level (BPMCA) and cerebrovascular
conductance (MFV/ BPMCA).

Detailed methods

On each test day the participant had abstained from caffeine, alcohol, and any
medications for the preceding 12 hours; was at least 2 hours postprandial; and had not exercised
heaVily in 24 hours. Upon arrival, the astronaut was placed in the supine position. Over the first
10-minutes the participant was instrumented for the study. This was followed by 5-min 0f
supine data collection during which the participant paced their breathing with an auditory signal
at 15 breaths per minute. The participant was then placed in the left lateral position for 7

carbon monoxide used in the blood volume measurement was very small and of short duration.
here was no signiﬁcant difference between two minute pre and two minutes post rebreathe
segments pre-ﬂight, landing day, or 3 days post ﬂight in either the ﬁnisher group (Pre vs post:
45.5i2.1 vs 49.7i2.6, 47.7i1.4 vs 50.0i1.7, 51.5i2.6 vs 51.4i2.8 ems'l) or in the non-ﬁnisher
group (Pre vs post: 50.5i5.7 vs 54.3i5.8, 49.7i6.7 vs 48.1i4.4, 57.8i6.4 vs 62.4i5.5 eni's'l).

Following the carbon monoxide rebreathe procedure, the participant was returned to the
supine position and, after two minutes, was assisted t0 the standing position by three
investigators. To minimize blood pressure changes due to the effort of standing, the participant
was lifted from behind both shoulders while their feet were swept off the bed. The participant
remained unassisted in the standing position for up to 10 min and was returned to the supine
position. During the first five minutes of the stand test, each participant was again requested to
follow an auditory signal to pace their breathing at 15 breaths per minute. If the participant
became presyncopal during the stand, they were returned immediately to the supine position.
Participants were deemed to be presyncopal if the participant indicated symptoms such as
dizziness or nausea, or if we observed any of the following: i) a sudden decrease in HR of more
than 15 beats per minute; ii) a decrease in systolic BP of more than 25 mm Hg per minute; iii) a
decrease in diastolic BP of more than 15 mm Hg per min; iV) a decrease in MFV of more than 15
cm/s per minute; or, V) loss of diastolic ﬂow.
Data Collection

Mean blood ﬂow velocity (MFV) 0f the middle cerebral artery (MCA) was measured

"12","ultrasound (Medasonics, Fremont, CA). The temporal window determined to produce the best
signal during pre-ﬂight testing was used 011 all test days. Blood pressure was measured using the
non-invasive Finapres (Ohmeda, Inglewood, CO). The finger with the continuous arterial
pressure device was held at heart level by a system of Velcro straps. Each participant was also
instrumented for an electrocardiogram.

The analog signals from these devices were recorded simultaneously at 12 kHz per
channel using an eight-ehannel digital tape recorder (TEAC RD—111T, Montebello, CA). Beat-
by-beat analysis of these data was performed off—line. The mean arterial blood pressure was
adjusted to the level of the MCA (BPMCA) by applying a hydrostatic correction. The pressure
and velocity envelope tracing, respectively, between the initial increases in blood pressure or
velocity after successive ECG R-waves described a single beat for both blood pressure and
cerebral blood ﬂow velocity. BPMCA and MFV for each beat were calculated as the arithmetic
average of the pressure and velocity waveforms respectively. The Doppler and blood pressure
tracings were manually reviewed for anomalies and movement artifact. Any unusable blood
ﬂow velocity or blood pressure data (raw data from beats in which the mean could not be
reliably calculated, either due to noise or lack of signal) were removed and the time series
adjusted by interpolating new values from the two valid points surrounding the excluded
segment. If more than 5% of any 256 beat segments were interpolated, the results were deemed
invalid. The eerebrovaseular resistance index (CVRi) was determined beat-by-beat as the ratio:
BPMCA/MFV. From these data BPMCA and CVRi time series were constructed for each participant
011 each of the test days.

"13","Dynamic Autoregulation Analysis:

In this study, care was taken to ensure that data used for eerebrovaseular analysis was
from segments that were closest to being steady state. Baseline analysis was performed on data
collected after the participant was supine for at least ten minutes and before the carbon monoxide
(CO) rebreathe test for blood volume. During the stand portion of the test, analysis was not
performed until at least one minute had passed, allowing for heart rate and blood pressure to
stabilize. This was at least three minutes after the CO-rebreathe protocol and at least eight
minutes after the inhalation of CO for the blood volume test.

The dynamic autoregulatory gain was determined using the non-invasive transfer
function method 2. Autospeetra 0f the MFV and CVRi were calculated and the mean spectral
power was determined within two distinct frequency regions (very low frequency, VLF: from 0
to 0.07 Hz; low frequency, LF: from 0.07 to 0.2 Hz) found to represent the region of cerebral
autoregulation 2. Cross-speetral power, transfer function gain and phase, and coherence were
determined within the same frequency regions for the relation between BPMCA 9 CVRi.

The BPMCA 9 CVRi transfer function relies on the inherent physical link between the
two measured variables BPMCA and MFV to calculate CVRi. The transfer function analysis of
BPMCA 9 CVRi provides an intuitively attractive means of assessing eerebrovaseular
autoregulation, inasmuch as improved autoregulation is denoted by increased gain and reduced
phase lag 2. In our study, therefore, eross-speetral power, transfer function gain and phase, and
coherence were determined within the same frequency regions for the relation between BPMCA
9 CVRi . Gain and phase relations were obtained only from those regions of the spectra where
coherence was greater than 0.5.
