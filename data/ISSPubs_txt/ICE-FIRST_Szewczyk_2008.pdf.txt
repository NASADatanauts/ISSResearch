Abstract
Traveling, living and working in space is now a reality. The number of people and length of time in space is increasing. With new
horizons for exploration it becomes more important to fully understand and provide countermeasures t0 the effects of the space enVi—
ronment 0n the human body. In addition, space provides a unique laboratory to study how life and physiologic functions adapt from
the cellular level to that of the entire organism. Caenorhabditis elegans is a genetic model organism used to study physiology on Earth.
Here we provide a description of the rationale, design, methods, and space culture validation of the ICE—FIRST payload, which engaged
C. elegans researchers from four nations. Here we also show C. elegans growth and development proceeds essentially normally in a Chem—
ically deﬁned liquid medium on board the International Space Station (10.9 day round trip). By setting ﬂight constraints ﬁrst and bring—
ing together established C. elegans researchers second, we were able to use minimal stowage space to successfully return a total of 53
independent samples, each containing more than a hundred individual animals, to investigators within one year of experiment concept.
We believe that in the future, bringing together individuals with knowledge of ﬂight experiment operations, ﬂight hardware, space biol—
ogy, and genetic model organisms should yield similarly successful payloads.
