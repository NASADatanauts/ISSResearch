Abstract Mechanical loading of mammalian tissues is a potent promoter of tissue growth and regeneration, whilst unloading in
microgravity can cause reduced tissue regeneration, possibly through effects on stem cell tissue progenitors. To test the specific
hypothesis that mechanical unloading alters differentiation of bone marrow mesenchymal and hematopoietic stem cell lineages,
we studied cellular and molecular aspects of how bone marrow in the mouse proximal femur responds to unloading in microgravity.
Trabecular and cortical endosteal bone surfaces in the femoral head underwent significant bone resorption in microgravity,
enlarging the marrow cavity. Cells isolated from the femoral head marrow compartment showed significant down-regulation
of gene expression markers for early mesenchymal and hematopoietic differentiation, including FUT1(—6.72), CSF2(—3.30),
CD90(—3.33), PTPRC(—2.79), and GDF15(—2.45), but not stem cell markers, such as SOX2. At the cellular level, in situ histological
analysis revealed decreased megakaryocyte numbers whilst erythrocytes were increased 2.33 fold. Furthermore, erythrocytes
displayed elevated fucosylation and clustering adjacent to sinuses forming the marrow—blood barrier, possibly providing a
mechanistic basis for explaining spaceflight anemia. Culture of isolated bone marrow cells immediately after microgravity
exposure increased the marrow progenitor's potential for mesenchymal differentiation into in-vitro mineralized bone nodules, and
hematopoietic differentiation into osteoclasts, suggesting an accumulation of undifferentiated progenitors during exposure to
microgravity. These results support the idea that mechanical unloading of mammalian tissues in microgravity is a strong inhibitor of
tissue growth and regeneration mechanisms, acting at the level of early mesenchymal and hematopoietic stem cell differentiation.

alterations in two stem cell markers, NOTCH1 and SOX2, that are found primarily on self-renewing and self-replicating stem cells and
therefore hypothesize that microgravity may not affect the self-renewal capacity of hematopoietic and mesenchymal stem cells.
Microgravity does, however, result in a broad down regulation of most genes associated with differentiation of both hematopoietic and
mesenchymal stem cells into terminally differentiated lineages. Furthermore, terminal differentiation markers of osteoblasts and
osteoclasts fail to appear in microgravity samples possibly indicating that the differentiation process is inhibited in response to
microgravity. We also note alterations in key activation genes of osteoblastogenesis, such as EGF, and TGFB1, and inactivation of
osteoclastogenesis activation factors, such as |L-1B, RANKL, CSF1, and OPG. Genes and arrows highlighted in red indicate up-regulation,
