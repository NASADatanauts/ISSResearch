Ahatraet,
Purpose: TO measure the location of heavy ionminclueed residual breakpoints in human Chromosome 5 and the size distribution of
chromosome fragments invutved in inter~ 0r intraehmmosomal exchanges.
z’til’aleriah and methods: Human peripheral blood lymphocytes were exposed to 4Gy accelerated ""GFe (iron) ions (500 IVKCV per nucleon
(MeVnml), linear energy transfer=200 kthtmwl). Cells were then stimulated to grow in vitro for 48h, and Chromosomes were
prematurely condensed by calyculin A. Chromosome 5 was painted using high—resolution multicolour banding. The location of the
observed residual breakpoints and the size of all ehromosmne 5 fragn'lents involved in structural aberrations were measured using
dedicated image analysis software.
Results: Mapping of 283 breakpoints revealed a slight deviation from randomness, with an excess of breakpoints Clustered in two small
hands and an under representation of breaks at the telomerie end in the q—arm. Breakpoints per unit length were similar in p- and q~arms.
The distribution of chromosome fragments has a maximum for very small fragments (< 10% 0f the chromosome size), indicating a severe
fragmentation of chromosome 5 after heavy—ion bombardment. Only fragments <40% of the chromosome size were involved in
intraehromosomal exchanges (interstitial deletions or inversions), whereas fragments up to 75% of the whole chromosome 5 were found in
interehromosomal exchanges.
()‘onclusimzr: Residual breakpoints after exposure to high—energy iron ions were not distributed randomly along chromosome 5, although the
p— and c1»arms displayed similar radiosensitivity. Large fragments are either restituted 0r misrejoined to other chromosome ends, whereas
small intraehrornosomal Iragments can produce either inter— 0r intrachron‘lcmm‘lal exchanges.
