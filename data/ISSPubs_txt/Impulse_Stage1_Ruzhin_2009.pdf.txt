Abstract—Insigniﬁcant geomagnetic disturbances, which originated during the experimental injection of
high—power radio pulses into the magnetosphere—ionosphere system with the help of an HF transmitter 0f
the Sura heating facility, are considered. The experiment was performed at 1840—1900 UT on October 2,
2007 (~2100 MLT) at geomagnetic latitudes close to the zone of generation of the current wedge westward
branch, responsible for geomagnetic substorms. The series of two magnetic microsubstorms, with a sudden
initial pulse and an insigniﬁcant delay relative to the facility switching, was observed at 1840—2000 UT A dis—
turbance was registered at many stations in the Northern Hemisphere as a global event. The equivalent ion—
ospheric current system of an initial pulse was similar to such a system of the westward auroral surge and had
an intensity maximum at Karpogory magnetic observatory, which is the closest station to the Sura facility.
Under the conditions of a quiet solar wind and low planetary geomagnetic activity, the AE auroral index cor—
related with the interplanetary medium parameters (the correlation coefﬁcient reached 0.65) at 1710—
2000 UT It has been conﬁrmed that an initial geomagnetic pulse is generated as a result of radiowave injec—
tion. The arguments for and against the generation of microsubstorms due to stimulated precipitation ofmag—
netospheric electrons, as well as the assumption that the geoeffective impact of the interplanetary medium is
intensiﬁed during the injection of high—power radiowaves near the zone where the westward branch of the
current wedge of magnetospheric substorms is generated, are considered.
