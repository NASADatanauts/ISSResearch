Abstract
The crystallization of proteins and other biological particles (including nucleic acids, nucleo—protein complexes and large assemblies such
as nucleosomes, ribosomal subunits or viruses) in a microgravity environment can produce crystals having lesser defects than crystals
prepared under normal gravity on earth. Such microgravity-grown crystals can diffract X-rays to a higher resolution and have a lower mosaic
spread. The inferred electron density maps can be richer in details owing to which more accurate three-dimensional structure models can be
built. Major results reported in this ﬁeld of research are reviewed. Novel ones obtained with the Advanced Protein Crystallization Facility are
presented. For structural biology, practical applications and implications associated with crystallization and crystallography onboard the
International Space Station are discussed.
