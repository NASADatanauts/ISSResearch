We analyzed protein proﬁle of urine samples obtained from 7 Russian cosmonauts (age 35-
51 years), participants of space ﬂights on the International Space Station lasting for 169-199
days. Gradient chromatography with linear increase of eluent proportion was carried out in a
system consisting of an Agilent 1100 chromatograph (Agilent Technologies Inc.) and a hybrid
mass-spectrometer LTQ-FT Ultra (Thermo). The obtained results help to understand changes
in the human body induced by space ﬂight factors.
