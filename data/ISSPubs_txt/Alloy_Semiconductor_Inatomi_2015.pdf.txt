BACKGROUND: InXGa1_XSb is an important material that has tunable properties in the infrared (IR) region and is suitable for

IR-device applications. Since the quality of crystals relies on growth conditions, the growth process of alloy semiconductors can be

examined better under microgravity (pG) conditions where convection is suppressed.

AIMS: To investigate the dissolution and growth process of InXGa1_XSb alloy semiconductors via a sandwiched structure of GaSb

(seed)/|nSb/GaSb(feed) under normal and p6 conditions.

METHODS: InXGa1_XSb crystals were grown at the International Space Station (ISS) under 116 conditions, and a similar experiment

was conducted under terrestrial conditions (16) using the vertical gradient freezing (VGF) method. The grown crystals were cut

along the growth direction and its growth properties were studied. The indium composition and growth rate of grown crystals were

calculated.

RESULTS: The shape of the growth interface was nearly ﬂat under 116, whereas under 16, it was highly concave with the initial seed

interface being nearly ﬂat and having facets at the peripheries. The quality of the 116 crystals was better than that of the 16

samples, as the etch pit density was low in the 116 sample. The growth rate was higher under 116 compared with 16. Moreover, the

growth started at the peripheries under 16, whereas it started throughout the seed interface under 116.

CONCLUSIONS: Kinetics played a dominant role under 16. The suppressed convection under 116 affected the dissolution and

growth process of the InXGa1_XSb alloy semiconductor.
