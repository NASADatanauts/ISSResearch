Purpose: To quantify the change in cerebral spinal fluid (CSF) production rate and maximum systolic velocity in astro-
nauts before and after exposure to microgravity and identify any physiologic trend and/or risk factor related to intracra-
nial hypertension.
Materials and Methods: Following Institutional Review Board (IRB) approval, with waiver of informed consent, a retro-
spective review of 27 astronauts imaged at 3T was done. Qualitative analysis was performed on T2-weighted axial
images through the orbits for degree of flattening of the posterior globe according to the following grades: 0 = none,
1 = mild, 2 = moderate, and 3 = severe. One grade level change postflight was considered significant for exposure to
intracranial hypertension. CSF production rate and maximum systolic velocity was calculated from cine phase-contrast
magnetic resonance imaging and compared to seven healthy controls.
Results: Fourteen astronauts were studied. The preflight CSF production rate in astronauts was similar to controls
(P: 0.83). Six astronauts with significant posterior globe flattening demonstrated a 70% increase in CSF production rate
postflight compared to baseline (P= 0.01). There was a significant increase in CSF maximum systolic velocity in the sub-
group without posterior globe flattening (P= 0.01).
Conclusion: The increased postflight CSF production rate in astronauts with positive flattening is compatible with the
hypothesis of microgravity-induced intracranial hypertension inferring downregulation in CSF production in microgravity
that is upregulated upon return to normal gravity. Increased postflight CSF maximum systolic velocity in astronauts with
negative flattening suggests increased craniospinal compliance and a potential negative risk factor to microgravity-
induced intracranial hypertension.

FIGURE 1: T2-weighted images with inverted gray scale in a postflight astronaut demonstrating CSF continuity from the intracra-
nial to the extracranial compartments. a: Mid-sagittal image shows CSF flow from the lateral and third ventricle to the 4th ventri-
cle (dashed line) via the cerebral aqueduct. From the 4th ventricle CSF continues into the cisterna magna (CM) (solid line),
supracellar cistern (SSC) (solid line), and spinal canal (SC) (dotted line). b: Axial image shows continuation of CSF flow from the
SSC into the optic nerve sheath of the right eye (black arrows). Intracranial CSF pressure is transmitted to the terminal end of the
optic nerve sheath (asterisk) via these communication pathways. Note that the optic nerve sheath is abnormally dilated and is
associated with flattening of the posterior globe (white arrows). Optic chiasm = arrowhead. Optic nerve = ON.

FIGURE 3: A conceptual model of CSF production rate at different phases of space flight. In preflight astronauts there is a hydro-
static gradient from high to low with pooling of fluid in the lower extremities (arrow). Intracranial CSF pressure and CSF produc-
tion rate are at baseline. With exposure to microgravity the hydrostatic gradient is absent. Fluid redistributes towards the head
(arrow). Intracranial CSF pressure increases and CSF production downregulates in compensation. A new equilibrium status is even-
tually established. In postflight astronauts the hydrostatic gradient returns to high to low and fluid shifts to the lower extremities
(arrow). Intracranial CSF pressure decreases and CSF production then upregulates in response to sudden lower pressure stimulus.
