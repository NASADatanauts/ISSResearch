Chromosome damage in peripheral blood cells is a sensitive indicator of radiation
exposure that can provide an in viva method for assessing radiation dose.
Increased levels of cytogenetic damage in astronaut’s blood lymphocytes after a
mission provide a direct measurement of the effects of space radiation exposure
and this datum can be used to measure radiation doses incurred during the ﬂight.
Although space radiation exposures can also be assessed using passive
thermoluminescent dosimeters (TLDs) and plastic nuclear track detectors
(PNTDs), multiple devices are required to detect all radiation types encountered in
space, and all currently available devices have poor sensitivity to neutrons. In
addition physical measurements only provide absorbed skin doses, Which must be
combined With computerized anatomical models and radiation transport codes to
estimate the dose at different regions of the body. In contrast biodosimetry is
internal and includes the effects of shielding provided by the body itself plus
chromosome damage and shows excellent sensitivity to all types of radiation
including neutrons. Biodosimetry provides information on individual sensitivity to
radiation in the presence of confounding factors such as microgravity and other
stress conditions. Moreover, chromosome damage may reﬂect cancer risk
(Bonassi et al 2005), and biodosimetry values can therefore be used to validate
and develop risk assessment models that can be used to characterize excess health
risk incurred by crew members.
Cytogenetic biodosimetry methods have been used extensively for assessing
terrestrial radiation exposures and remain the most sensitive in viva indicator of
dose available to date. The main cellular radiation target is the DNA, and
radiation-induced damage in the DNA molecule can be Visualized as aberrations
in the chromosomes (breaks in the chromosomes or exchanges of DNA material
between different chromosomes). Normal chromosomes contain a single
condensed and constricted area called a centromere that helps the chromosome
number to remain stable when a cell divides.
Figure 1. Examples of solid stained chromosomes, showing a dicentric
chromosome (a chromosome With 2 centromeres) that results from the fusion of
two broken chromosomes, a fragment from chromosome breakage, and a ring that
results from fusion of the broken ends of a single chromosome.

The ﬁrst studies on the peripheral blood lymphocytes of crew members in the
Gemini (Bender et a1, 1967 and 1968) and Mir programs (Federenko et a1, 2003,
Testard et a1, 1997) used solid Giemsa staining techniques to assess chromosome
damage in the form of dicentrics, rings, and fragments. Results indicated that crew
members who participated in ﬂights lasting 3 weeks or less showed no signiﬁcant
elevation of chromosome damage post ﬂight, whereas most crew members who
participated in missions lasting 4-6 months had elevated chromosome damage
post ﬂight. Pooled data for individuals who had increased chromosome damage
showed a post-ﬂight dicentric yield that was roughly 3 times preﬂight values.
However, large inter-indiVidual variations were reported, with some individuals
haVing no appreciable increase in dicentric yield post ﬂight.
Evidence from these early cytogenetic studies strongly indicated that the radiation
dose accumulated during a long-duration ﬂight can induce measurable increases
in the yield of chromosome damage, whereas the doses encountered during
shorter missions of a few weeks or less are below the threshold for detection using
this technique. However, the type of chromosomal aberration evaluated is an
important factor when considering these data. All of the early astronaut studies
focused on the detection of dicentric chromosomes. This technique has been used
for many years to evaluate accidental radiation exposures because pre-eXposure
background levels are very low. It has been well documented that radiation-
induced dicentrics undergo time-dependent decay in blood lymphocytes because
they impede proper cell division. Dicentrics have been estimated to have an
average half—life of about 3 years in human peripheral blood lymphocytes, but
recent studies indicate that great inter-indiVidual variability eXists in decay rates.
It would follow that the use of dicentric aberrations for biodosimetry analysis after
missions lasting several months may not be reliable due to the loss of aberrant
cells during the mission, and this may explain the inter-indiVidual variations
reported for post-ﬂight yields of dicentrics. In addition, any signiﬁcant inter-
individual variability in the rate of loss of cells with dicentrics would indicate that
yields could not be accurately corrected for elimination of this type of exchange
from the blood.

"3","The introduction of the ﬂuorescence in Situ hybridization (FISH) chromosome
painting technique radically improved the ease and accuracy of assessing yields of
monocentric aberrations such as translocations (exchanges of material between
two chromosomes that each retain a single centromere). With the FISH
chromosome painting method, it is possible to “paint” individual chromosomes
with different colors, and aberrations can be easily identiﬁed as multi-color
chromosomes.
Figure 2. Example of FISH chromosome painting. The image on the left shows a
cell with two normal copies of chromosome 1 (red), chromosome 2 (green), and
chromosome 4 (yellow); the rest of the chromosomes are stained blue. The image
on the right shows a cell with a translocation involving one copy of chromosome
1 and a blue-stained chromosome.

As monocentric chromosome aberrations do not impose mechanistic interference
with cell division, lymphatic stem cells should be able to produce new
lymphocytes containing stable aberrations, and yields of this type of exchange are,
therefore, considered to be stable with time and are commonly believed to persist
in peripheral blood cells for many years. This indicates that translocations are a
more appropriate tool than dicentric analysis for assessing the effect of chronic
radiation exposures such as those encountered during long-duration space
missions, as well as for assessing radiation doses retrospectively. Background
levels of translocations are higher than those of dicentrics; they are known to
increase with age, and show considerable variation between individuals, which
limits the usefulness of this technique for accidental exposure scenarios
Occupational exposure, such as space ﬂight, is distinct from accidental exposure
because pre-exposure levels of translocations can be measured accurately,
allowing greater sensitivity in biological dose estimations.
NASA has implemented a biodosimetry program that utilizes the FISH
chromosome painting technique to assess chromosomal aberrations in all US
astronauts who participate in long-duration International Space Station (188)
missions. Chromosomes are examined in thousands of lymphocyte cells to
identify any structural alterations. The increase in the frequency of chromosomal

preﬂight in vitro calibration curves (George et al, 2001 and 2005, Yang et al,
1997). For all individuals, the frequency of chromosome damage measured Within
a month of return from an ISS mission of 3 months or more was higher than their
preﬁght yield, and biodosimetry estimates lay Within the range expected from
physical dosimetry.
Figure 3. Biological doses for 23 astronauts Who participated in long-duration
missions of 3 months or more on board the ISS (Cucinotta et al., 2008). The solid
line represents the results of a weighted linear regression model for estimating the
dose using physical measurements. For the majority of this group, there is a close
relationship between these effective dose estimates and the biological dose
equivalent. For some individuals there is a signiﬁcant difference in the biological
and physical dose values and it is possible these differences may reﬂect inter-
individual variation in response to radiation exposure.

Using the cancer risk coefﬁcients recommended by the National Council on
Radiation Protection and Measurements (NCRP) the dose range listed in ﬁgure 3
would correspond to about a 0.5% increase in developing cancer over a lifetime.
As chromosome aberrations in peripheral blood lymphocytes are possible
biomarkers of cancer risk, chromosome damage data is being used to develop
risk—assessment models that can directly project excess health risk incurred by
individual crew members without the extrapolation factors inherent in the NCRP
modeling method (Durante et al 2001, Cucinotta and Durante 2006). The
biological based risk estimates could provide individual risks that take into
account sensitivity to radiation and may be more accurate and informative than
population based risk estimations.
