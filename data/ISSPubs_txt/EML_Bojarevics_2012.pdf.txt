Dynamic models are used to investigate the behavior of liquid droplets
suspended in alternating current and direct current magnetic ﬁelds in
microgravity and in various conﬁgurations providing conditions similar to
microgravity. The realistic magnetic ﬁelds of solenoidal coils are used for the
modeling experiments with electrically conducting (liquid silicon or metal)
droplets. At high values of magnetic ﬁeld, some oscillation modes are damped
quickly, while others are modiﬁed with a considerable shift of the oscillating
droplet frequencies and the damping constants from the nonmagnetic case. On
a larger scale, the models are used to investigate the melting and heating
process of reactive materials. It is demonstrated how 1 kg of liquid titanium in
a traditional “cold” crucible—type furnace can be fully leVitated without contact
