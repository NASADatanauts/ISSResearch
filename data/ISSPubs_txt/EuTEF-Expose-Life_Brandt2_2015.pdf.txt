Abstract The lichen Xanthoria elegans has been exposed to space and simulated Mars—analogue
environment in the Lichen and Fungi Experiment (LIFE) 0n the EXPOSE-E facility at the
International Space Station (188). This long-term exposure of 559 days tested the ability of various
organisms to cope With either low earth orbit (LEO) 0r Mars—analogue conditions, such as vacuum,
Mars—analogue atmosphere, rapid temperature cycling, cosmic radiation of up to 215 i 16mGy,
and insolation of accumulated doses up to 4.87 GJan, including up to 0.314GJI11—2 of UV
irradiation. In a previous study, X. elegans demonstrated considerable resistance towards these
conditions by means of photosynthetic activity as well as by post-exposure metabolic activity of
5 0—80 % in the algal and 60—90 % in the fungal symbiont (Brandt et a1. Int J Astrobiol 14(3):411—
425, 2015). The two objectives of the present study were complementary: First, to verify the high
post-exposure Viability by using a qualitative cultivation assay. Second, to characterise the cellular
damages by transmission electron microscopy (TEM) Which were caused by the space and Mars-
analogue exposure conditions of LIFE. Since the algal symbiont of lichens is considered as the
more susceptible partner (de Vera and Ott 2010), the analyses focused on the photobiont. The
study demonstrated growth and proliferation of the isolated photobiont after all exposure
conditions of LIFE. The ultrastructural analysis of the algal cells provided an insight to cellular
damages caused by long-term exposure and highlighted that desiccation—induced breakdown of

Introduction

Since the beginning of the new millennium, various astrobiological experiments were conducted
to test the effects of space and Mars—analogue conditions on lichens, mosses, fungi and prokary-
otes. These simulation experiments tested the single or combined effects of vacuum up to 10—5 Pa
and UV—radiation (de Vera et a1. 2003, 2004a, 2004b, 2008, 2010; de La Vega et a1. 2007; de Vera
& Ott 2010; sanchez et a1. 2012, 2014; Baque et a1. 2013; MeeBen et a1. 2014), hypervelocity
impact pressures up to 50GPa (Stofﬂer et a1. 2007; Horneck et a1. 2008), but also tested the
resistance to other space—related parameters as freezing and drought (Onofri et a1. 2004; Haj ek
et a1. 2012; MeeBen et a1., 2014). Additionally, the lichen Xanthoria elegans was part of the space
exposure experiments LICHENS II on BIOPAN 5, LITHOPANSPERMLA on BIOPAN 6
(Sancho et a1. 2007; de la Torre et a1. 2007, 2010; Olsson—Francis et a1., 2010; Raggio et a1.
2011) and consequently became part of the Lichen and Fungi Experiment (LIFE) on EXPOSE-E/
EuTEF at the 188 where it was exposed among other organisms to space and simulated Mars
conditions for 18 months (Cockell et a1. 2011; Onofri et a1. 2012; Rabbow et a1. 2012; Scalzi et a1.
2012; Brandt et a1. 2015). The EXPOSE-E facility provided LEO-space vacuum (10—4 to 10—7 Pa)
and simulated Mars conditions (103 Pa Mars—analogue atmosphere) under three different insola-
tion regimes of 100 % transmission, 0.1 % transmission (T) and no insolation as described below,
leading to accumulated insolation doses up to 4.87 GJm—2 and UV irradiation doses of up to 314
MJm_2 at the sample sites of X. elegans.

The astrobiological model lichen X. elegans is a symbiotic association of an ascomycete
fungus (mycobiont) and a coccal green alga (photobiont, genus T rebouxia). This cosmopolite
lichen is well adapted to harsh environmental conditions as found in high alpine and polar
regions (sttedal & Lewis Smith 2001). It is characterized by the secondary lichen compound
parietin known for its high light- and UV—screening capacities (Solhaug & Gauslaa 1996;
Solhaug et a1. 2003, 2010). To assess its limits of survival after LIFE, Xelegans was tested on
its resistance to the applied conditions and the exposure—induced decrease of post—eXposure
Viability by chlorophyll a ﬂuorescence and live/dead staining analyses (Onofri et a1. 2012;
Brandt et a1. 2015). Both methods revealed high rates of metabolic and photosynthetic activity.

The live/dead staining results of the photobiont revealed Viability rates of 50—80 %, while the
more resistant mycobiont showed rates of 60—90 %. The photosynthetic re-activation 0f the
photobiont depended on the exposure conditions. Vacuum exposed and fully insolated (100 %
transmission) samples took 8 days of re-activation to reach c. 45 % of its pre-ﬂight maximum
quantum yield of photosystem 11 while the Mars-analogue samples of all insolation conditions
returned to pre-ﬂight values within 4 days (Onofri et al. 2012, Brandt et al. 2015).

The present study conducted a qualitative cultivation assay of the isolated photobiont to
corroborate the 5 0—80 % of remaining metabolic activity and the photosynthetic re-activation
of X. elegans as indicators of post-ﬂight Viability. This assay conﬁrmed the Viability of
photobiont cells/clusters after 1.5 years of space exposure by growth and proliferation, i.e.by
its ability to perform complete cell cycles. The present study demonstrates a capacity of
survival beyond the metabolic and photosynthetic activities reported before (Onofri et al.
2012, Brandt et al. 2015). Complementary, the analysis by transmission electron microscopy
(TEM) also investigated the impact of extreme desiccation 0n photobiont ultrastructure as
induced by 1.5 year exposure to space vacuum and Mars—analogue atmosphere conditions.
This part of the study aimed to characterise the impairment 0n the cellular level by vacuum and
low atmospheric pressure that may explain the loss of 20—50 % of algal Viability observed in
previous studies (Brandt et al. 2015). Both parts of the present study focused on the isolated
photobiont, as it is described to be the more sensitive symbiotic partner towards simulated
space and Martian conditions (de Vera et al. 2003, 2008; de Vera & Ott 2010).

Material and Methods
Lichen Samples Samples of Xanthoria elegans (Link) Th. Fr. (1860) were collected in
June 2008 at Col du Sanetsch, Valais, Switzerland (46021’48""N, 07017’51”E, at 2140
m a.s.l.) and adjacent collection sites (Zermatt, 46000’N, 07071’E, at 1950m a.s.l.). Samples
originating from this collection sites were used in astrobiological studies before (de Vera et al.
2003, 2004a, 2004b, 2008, 2010) and consistently showed high Viability after these studies.
Exposure Conditions The samples were exposed in the EXPOSE-E facility outside the
European Columbus Module at the 188 for 559 days. Six experimental conditions were
realised: Eight samples each were exposed to space (tray 1) and Mars-analogue conditions
(tray 2). Tray 1 provided 10—4 t0 10—7Pa LEO-Vacuurn and three intensities of solar radiation
(dark, 0.1 % transmission by neutral density ﬁlters, and 100 % transmission (T)) from 110
nm < A > 1mm (covered with MgFZ windows) while tray 2 provided simulated Mars
conditions with a 103Pa atmosphere (95.3 % C02, 2.7 % N2, 1.6 % Ar, 0.15 % OZ, ~370
ppm water vapour) and again three intensities of solar irradiation (as above) from 200
nm < A > 1mm (covered by Suprasil quartz windows). At the sample sites, fully insolated
samples accumulated an average of 4800MJrn_2 photon energy input; 0.1 % transmission
samples accumulated 6.3 MJm_2 photon energy in tray 1 and 5.9 MJm_2 in tray 2. The portions
of UV—irradiation ranged from 291MJm_2 at 100 % T to 0.271MJm_2 at 0.1 % T under space
conditions (110nm < A >400rnrn) and from 314MJm_2 at 100 % T to 0.257MJm‘2 at 0.1 % T
under Mars conditions (200nm < A >400rnrn). The samples experienced ionizing radiation of
208 i 8mGy in tray 1, and 215 i 16mGy in tray 2 (Berger et al. 2012) and a temperature range
from —21.7 to +43 0C with a short-tirne maximum of 610C and 100 freeze/thaw cycles
(Rabbow et al. 2012). According to the data received from the EXPOSE-E facility, a

corresponding set of samples was exposed to as similar as possible simulated conditions,
referred to as Mission Ground Reference (MGR; Rabbow et a1. 2012). Due to off-norninal
events during the mission about 20 % 0f the expected environmental data were lost. To assure
precise sample analysis of the exposure conditions the solar irradiation was recalculated
(RedShift Report 2011) leading to accumulated irradiance values differing from those given
in Rabbow et a1. (2012). During LIFE the lichen samples stayed in anhydrobiotic state during
the whole experiment. After return all samples were stored frozen (—200C) until further
investigations.

Culture Assay The symbiotic algae were prepared from the lichen sample under sterile
conditions, using a hollow needle and a scalpel to place algal clusters immediately on
Trebouxia Organic Medium agar-plates (Ahmadjian 1967) and BG11 medium.
Amphotericin-B (5 ug/rnl) and Ampicillin (200 ug/ml) were added to both media to prevent
fungal and bacterial contamination. 10—15 colonies per agar-plate and per media were
inoculated for each experimental condition, including untreated controls. The cultivation took
place at 120C under 14h daytime photosynthetic photon ﬂux density of 15—25 um01m_2s_1.
Algal colonies were inspected daily to detect contaminations and were re-inoculated 0n steri1e
media in case of Visible contamination. Growing colonies were photo—docurnented using a
stereo microscope (Zeiss, Germany) with a digital camera (Pentax). After 200 days of
cultivation the experiment was concluded. For subsequent studies the algae were transferred
to glycerin stocks and stored at —200C.

Transmission Electron Microscopy (TEM) Sample pieces of lichen tha11i of a11 exposure
conditions (G. 2mm in diameter) were ﬁxed in 2.5 % glutaraldehyde (in 200mM cacodylate-
buffer), contrasted in 4 % OsO4 (in 0.8 % potassium ferrocyanide), and dried by graduated
dilution series of ethanol and acetone prior to critical point drying (CPD 020, Balzers Union).
The ﬁxed samples were embedded in Ep0n812 resin following the manufacturer’s protocol
and ultrathin cross—sections (100nm) were examined with a Zeiss E902 TEM. To test the effect
of prolonged dry storage, two different controls were chosen: one from dry storage over silica-
gel, the other was kept in the freezer at —200C. Cell counting was performed manually using
the Image] counter tool (V1.49 rn Wayne Rasband). Image processing of the micrographs was
done with Fiji macros (Biovoxxel 2014). For statistical analyses (one-way ANOVA with post-
test) GraphPad InStat3 was applied (GraphPad software 2003).

Explanation of Ultrastructural Terminology Cell wall: rigid layer surrounding the pro-
toplast of plant cells; protoplast: plant cell without its ce11wa11; thylakoid: compartment of the
chloroplast where thylakoid membranes enclose the thylakoid lumen, site of light-dependent
reaction of photosynthesis; pyrenoid: compartment of the chloroplast, spherical protein struc-
ture, site of COZ-ﬁxation; pyrenoglobuli: osmiophilic, electron-dense globuli of uncertain
function, most likely sites of lipid storage; grana: thylakoid membrane stacks in the chloroplast.

analogue conditions. The algal colonies ﬁom different exposure conditions revealed qualitative
differences in proliferation rate and ﬁnal colony size (F igs. 1 and 2) while the control group
samples showed the fastest growth. They formed larger colonies in equivalent periods of time
when compared to all experimental conditions tested. By comparing the ratio of initially
inoculated algal clusters to grown colonies, the results indicate that exposure to Mars-analogue
conditions had less effects on the proliferation abilities when compared to the algal colonies
derived from space vacuum exposure conditions (Table 1). Colonies from Mars-analogue
exposure conditions grew faster and became larger in size in the respective time. Despite varying
by three orders of magnitude, the different insolation conditions (no insolation, 0.1 % T, and
100 % T) had no Visible effect on the samples exposed to Mars—analogue conditions (Fig. 2).
Compared to Mars-analogue conditions, the vacuum exposed samples showed an overall reduc-
tion in proliferation and colony-forming ratio. In general, the Viability of non-insolated samples
was not increased compared to irradiated ones. In line with previous investigations on the
metabolic activity (Brandt et al. 2015), the present results indicate that insolation, especially
UV—irradiation, seems not to be the crucial factor affecting post-exposure Viability under the
experimental conditions tested. Among the cultivated photobionts one mycelium arose putatively
ﬁom co-isolated hyphae and was transferred to malt—yeast media (Fig. 2) for fuIther cultivation.
Ultrastructural Analyses by TEM The current analysis focused on the ultrastructural
impairment of the photobiont of Xanthoria elegans to investigate damaging to lethal effects
experienced during LIFE. Detailed analysis of the micrographs revealed distinct ultrastructural
features of algal degeneration. Collapses of the cell or of the protoplast alone were frequently
recognised and served as markers of exposure-induced damages. Under all investigated
exposure conditions, a portion of photobiont cells showed partial or complete collapse of the
protoplast with or without cell wall deformation (Fig. 3A-C). The frequency of cellular
collapses differed between dry-stored and frozen control group. Dry-stored control samples
showed a signiﬁcantly higher amount of protoplast (70 %) and cell wall collapses (49 %)
compared to frozen ones (44 % and 33 %, respectively) indicating a more deleterious effect of
long-term desiccation than freezing (Table 2). The intensity of damage also differed between
samples exposed to Mars-analogue atmosphere and space vacuum but none of the irradiation
conditions correlated to the percentage of cell wall and protoplast collapses. Exposure to Mars-
analogue atmosphere of 103Pa caused comparable numbers of protoplast collapses (57 %,
48 %, 51 % at non-irradiated, 0.1 % T and 100 % T, respectively). Exposure to vacuum (10—4
to 10—7Pa) showed higher numbers of collapsed protoplasts (61 %, 97 %, 85 %) even when
compared to the dry control samples. Except for the non-irradiated samples, deformed cell
walls occurred in space vacuum samples in higher percentage when compared to Mars-
analogue conditions (25 %, 79 %, 85 % compared to 27 %, 16 %, 35 %, Table 2).The
MGR data conﬁrmed these results. The MGR simulation of Mars—analogue conditions caused

40—42 % 0f collapsed protoplasts while the MGR simulation of space vacuum led to 52—86 %
0f collapsed protoplasts.

Based on previous observations (Brown et a1. 1987; Ascaso et a1. 1988, 1995; Honegger
2003), changes in pyrenoid structure, localisation and appearance of pyrenoglobuli, degraded
grana, and degraded thylakoid membranes were taken as additional markers of desiccation-
induced cellular damage (Fig. 4).The degree of thylakoid membrane degradation and
pyrenoid-enlargement was moderate in the frozen control and more pronounced in the dry
control (Fig. 4 21). Even more pronounced thylakoid membrane degradation was observed in
samples from space vacuum exposure and Mars-analogue exposure (Fig. 4 b-c). The pyrenoid-
enlargement and appearance of pyrenoglobuli were observed to various extent but did not
correlate to the experimental conditions applied (Fig. 4 d-e). Pyrenoglobuli were documented
in all samples except in non- and 0.1 %-ins01ated Mars-analogue samples and appeared most
frequently in the frozen control group (Fig. 4 f).

In general, the ultrastructural markers of thylakoid membrane degradation, cell wall and
protoplast collapse indicate that the extreme and long-term desiccation of space vacuum and -
less effective - Mars atmospheric pressure was the major impairment factor of the exposure
conditions of LIFE. However, any LIFE exposure condition enhanced the observed degrada-
tion patterns of photobiont cells when compared to the two control samples.

Discussion
Post-Exposure Viability The present study veriﬁed the Viability of the lichen photobiont 0f
Xanthoria elegans after 18 months under the extreme conditions of LEO-space exposure by
demonstrating the photobiont’s ability to grow and proliferate after isolation from the thallus.
These results are consistent with the results of previous quantitative analyses of photosynthetic

of growth or proliferation. The present results demonstrate that the lichen’s Viability was more
preserved under Mars-analogue conditions compared to space vacuum. Insolation and/or UV-
radiation were not the maj or parameters affecting the post—exposure Viability of the photobiont.
The results of chlorophyll a ﬂuorescence showed lower rates of photosynthetic activity in the
space vacuum samples than in the Mars-analogue ones (Brandt et a1. 2015). The present
cultivation assay of the photobiont confirmed this pattern, broadening it ﬁom mere metabolic
activity to the actual ability of proliferation and growth. Besides X. elegans, other eukaryotic
organisms were exposed to space or Mars-analogue conditions in the LIFE experiments on
EXPOSE-E. A11 organisms revealed certain resistance to the hostile conditions (Horneck et a1.
2012; Onoﬁi et a1. 2012), but the Viability and proliferation ability of symbiotic X. elegans
photobionts is not reached by other tested model organisms. In contrast to the photobiont of
X. elegans, the cryptoendolithic fungi Cryomyces antarcticus and Cryptomyces minterii lost their
colony-forrning ability, though the former ﬁmgus showed 80 % of intact cells in a PCR—assay after
exposure to full insolation (Onoﬁi et a1. 2012).

light and UV screening abilities (Solhaug & Gauslaa 1996; Nybakken et a1. 2004; Solhaug
et a1. 2010) efﬁciently protecting both symbionts. The amount of deposited parietin is
stimulated by UV insolation in the natural habitat (Solhaug et a1. 2003, Gauslaa & McEvoy
2005) mostly leading to a parietin-bearing cortical layer of 20—65 mm thickness on the cortex
(MeeBen et al. 2013a). Thus, UVB, UVC and blue light are efﬁciently blocked by parietin in
the upper cortex of the anhydrobiotic lichen (Gauslaa & Solhaug 2004; Solhaug et a1. 2010,
MeeBen et al. 2013b). This observation is stressed by the result that the different insolation
regimes applied in LIFE did not correlate to the recognised differences of photobiont Viability.
As discussed below, we suggest another parameter of the exposure conditions to account in
large pan for the observed loss of photobiont Viability.
Temporary Ultrastructural Changes in Anhydrobiosis The key factor of lichens to
survive extreme environmental conditions is anhydrobiosis (Crowe et a1. 1992; Kramer et a1.
2008). Both symbionts in lichens are adapted to poikilohydry resisting wet-dry cycles in their
natural habitats including thallus water ﬂuctuations between <20 and >160 % water per thallus
dry weight (Kappen 1988). Anhydrobiosis is accompanied by Visible alterations of the cellular
ultrastructure (Honegger et a1. 1996; Honegger 2003; de los Rios et a1. 2004, 2010).
Photobiont cells are known to collapse temporarily upon dehydration under terrestrial condi-
tions Which appeared to be normal in the course of desiccation and rehydration (Brown et a1.

1987; Honegger et al. 1996; de los Rios et al. 2004). Lichen photobionts quickly recover their

spherical shape when re-hydrated (e.g. during TEM-preparation, Honegger et al. 1996;

Honegger 2003).

Permanent Ultrastructural Damages by Long-Term Desiccation Permanent cellular

collapses occur the more frequently the longer the dehydration period lasts and indicate

desiccation-induced damage that may lead to death after siX years of dry storage (Honegger

2003). In contrast, frozen storage (>9 years at —200C) of desiccated Trebouxia photobionts

preserved their Viability (Honegger et al. 1996; Honegger 2003). Collapsed photobiont cells as

well as the observed degradation of thylakoid membranes were recognised as suitable markers

for desiccation—induced impairment in the present study. Vacuum desiccation is considered the

main process affecting biological samples when exposed to space vacuum (Horneck et al.

2010) while pressure conditions similar to those of Mars (e. g. at the upper boundary of Earth’s

biosphere) create desiccation-related effects as well (Horneck et al. 2010). Consistently, TEM

micrograph analysis revealed that both conditions, LEO-Vacuurn and the 103 Pa Mars—analogue

atmosphere, caused an increased amount of collapsed protoplasts and cell walls, restricting the

photobiont’s capacity of rehydration. Concerning the degradation of the thylakoid membranes

and pyrenoid enlargement, all exposed samples showed a higher frequency of both damage

markers which were unrelated to certain exposure conditions but more pronounced than in the

control groups. These results stress the deleterious effect of vacuum-induced, long-time

desiccation in the space exposed samples, while - due to the higher atmospheric pressure -

the desiccation condition under Mars—analogue conditions were less extreme and therefore the

samples were less impacted.
