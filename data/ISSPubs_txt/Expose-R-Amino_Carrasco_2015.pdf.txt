Abstract: The scientiﬁc aim of the present campaign is to study the Whole chain of methane
photo-degradation, as initiated by Solar vacuum-ultraviolet irradiation in Titan’s atmosphere. For this
purpose, the AMINO experiment on the EXPOSE-R mission has loaded closed cells for gas-phase
photochemistry in space conditions. Two different gas mixtures have been exposed, named Titan 1 and
Titan 2, involving both Nz—CH4 gas mixtures, Without and With C02, respectively. C02 is added as a
source of reactive oxygen in the cells. The cell contents were analysed thanks to infrared absorption
spectroscopy, gas chromatography and mass spectrometry. Methane consumption leads to the formation
of saturated hydrocarbons, With no detectable inﬂuence of C02. This successful campaign provides a
ﬁrst benchmark for characterizing the Whole methane photochemical system in space conditions. A thin ﬁlm
of tholin-like compounds appears to form on the cell walls of the exposed cells.
