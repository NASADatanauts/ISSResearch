Flmd sequesuatlon vein were 0.50 and 0.54 cmz. The RV myocardial performance Tei index was calculated
by dividing the sum of the isovolumic contraction time and isovolumic relaxation time
by the ejection time ((IVCT+IVRT)/ET); baseline and Braslet—on values for Tei index were
0.25 and 0.22, respectively. Braslet Tei indices are within normal ranges found in
healthy terrestrial subjects and temporarily become greater than 0.4 during the
dynamic Braslet release portion of the study. Conclusions: TD modality was successfully
implemented in space ﬂight for the ﬁrst time. TD of RV revealed that the Braslet
inﬂuenced cardiac preload and that ﬂuid was sequestered in the lower extremity
interstitial and vascular space after only 10 min of application. This report demonstrates
that Braslet application has an effect on RV physiology in long—duration space ﬂight
based on TD, and that this effect is in part due to venous hemodynamics.
