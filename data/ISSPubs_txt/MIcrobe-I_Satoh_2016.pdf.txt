As a part of a series of studies regarding the microbial biota in manned space
environments, we isolated fungi from six pieces of equipment recovered from the
J apanese Experimental Module “KIBO” 0f the International Space Station (188) and
from a Space Shuttle. Thirty-seven strains of fungi were isolated and identiﬁed, and
were investigated with regard to morphological phenotypes and antifungal
susceptibilities. The variety of fungi isolated in this study was similar to several
previous reports. The dominant species belonged to the genera Penicillium, Aspergillus,
and Cladosporium, which are potential causative agents of allergy and opportunistic
infections. The morphological phenotypes and antifungal susceptibilities of the strains
isolated from space environments were not significantly different from those of
reference strains on Earth.

"5","Introduction
There have been several reports regarding microbial contamination of manned space
vehicle environments (1, 2, 3, 4). Some fungi (mainly Penicillium, Aspergillus, and
Cladosporium) were detected within the USA space station Skylab and Russian space
station Mir (2, 3). These fungal species present on structural materials (metal or rubber
plates) are well-known potential biodegraders of polymers (substrates of electronic
equipment), and are therefore considered to possibly produce biointerference, damage to
structural materials, and malfunctions, and induce failure of various space systems and
equipment (4). Indeed, some electronic equipment was shown to have been decomposed
by fungi 0n Mir (5). The fungi isolated from these space vehicles are common
saprophytie fungi present in the normal living environment, and are opportunistic
pathogens and allergens (6). Our previous study showed that the J apanese Experiment
Module (JEM), “KIBO” of 188, was clean and n0 fungal strains were isolated
approximately 460 days after it was launched to the 188 (7). However, after the repeated
use of the vehicle, the fungal biota would gradually become mature (4). To prevent
health disorders and equipment problems in long-term space life, including Mars

1

"6","exploration, it is necessary to continue monitoring fungal biota in closed space
environments. However, in practice it is difficult to periodically obtain samples from
space vehicles. The crews of the ISS and other space vehicles have many missions and
sometimes encounter irregular problems. The schedules to carry out each mission are
very tight, so some missions are skipped.
In this study, we obtained samples from siX pieces of equipment recovered from 188
and other space vehicles. We cultured the isolated fungi from the equipment and
identiﬁed them by PCR and direct sequencing. A11 isolates were investigated for
morphological phenotype and antifungal agent susceptibilities to monitor the microbial
biota in manned space environments.
2 Materials and methods
2.1 Sampled equipment as fungal habitats
Table 1 shows the sampled equipment and sampling dates.
The Multi-Protocol Converter (MPC) (J apan Manned Space Systems Corporation
(JAMSS), Tsukuba, Japan in cooperation with B.U.G., 1110., Sapporo, Japan) (Fig. 1A)
is an image transfer and processing system that was developed to facilitate downlinking

"7","0f high-deﬁnition television and Ethernet data (8). MPC and DC Power Supply Unit for
MPC (PSU) (Fig. 1B) have cooling fans in their interior. MPCl and MPC2 were used in
the ISS, MPC3 was used in STS-125 (Space Shuttle Atlantis), and MPC4 was used in a
NASA mission, the detailed contents of which are unclear. MPC had been used for
approximately 1 hour per day in the 188 (9). The total operating times of the other
equipment were not known.
The Cell Biology Experiment Facility (CBEF) is used for various life science
experiments, such as cultivating cells, plants, etc., in the JEM Pressurized Module (10).
One G compartment has a turntable (T-CBEF) (Fig. 1C) that can control gravity from
0.1 to 2.0 G for gravity contrast experiments. The CBEF has humidifieation equipment
for the biological experiments.

2 . 2 S a m p | i n g
The surface samples were collected with swabs (ITW Texwipe®; ITW Texwipe,
Kernersville, NC) and Microbe Detection Sheets (MDS) (Sanita-kun® for
YEAST/MOLD; IN C Corp, Tokyo, J apan), which are culture sheets for rapid

"8","enumeration of fungi (11) and sampling surfaces; the MDS were stuck on and peeled
off three times. Inside of housings 0r substrates of MPC and PSU were swabbed 7 X 7
cm, 49 01112. Only surfaces were sampled in the T-CBEF. Sampling was performed at
Tsukuba Space Center (TKSC) (Ibaraki, J apan) 0r Meisei Electric C0., Ltd. (Gunma,
J apan) (Table 1). MPC2 was hardly used, and no dust could be observed with the naked
eye. Dust and thin and short hair were observed in the other three MPCs and PSU (Fig.
1 D).

2 .3 C u | t u re
Swabs were streaked onto DG-18 (Oxoid, Cambridge, UK) plates. All of plates and
MDS were incubated at 280C. The culture period was usually 3 — 4 days, with 1 month
as the longest.

2.4 Molecular identification for fungal isolates
Fungal DNA was extracted from isolates as described previously (12). The DNA
fragments covering the nuclear 288 rDNA D1/D2 domain and the ITS region were
ampliﬁed using the primers 2SSF1 and 635 (13), ITSl and ITS4 (14). For genus

1

"
"9","Penicillium and Aspergillus, beta-tubulin gene was ampliﬁed using the primers Bt2a
and Bt2b (15), or btub1 (benA) and btub2 (benA) (16). For Alternaria tenuissima,
translation machinery associated protein (T ma22) gene,
CDP-diaeylglyeerol-glycer01-3-ph0sphate 3-ph0sphatidyltransferase (Pgsl), and DNA
polymerase zeta catalytic subunit (R6123) gene were ampliﬁed using the primers
MS432-A-F and MS432-A-R, MSSSO-A-F and MSSSO-A-R,and MSS78-A-F and
MSS78-A-R (17). DNA sequencing was performed with an Applied Biosystems model
310 sequencer (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA). The isolated strains were
identiﬁed by comparison with DNA sequences registered in GenBank/EMBL/DDBJ as
described previously (12).

2.5 Morphological testing
Microscopic morphology was investigated on slide cultures using the methods
described by Reiss et a1. (18).

2.6 Antifungal susceptibility testing
Antifungal susceptibility testing can be performed only for the strains that produce

"
"10","sufﬁcient numbers of eonidia and 17 strains were used, as shown in Table 2. Antifungal
susceptibility tests were performed With seven antifungal drugs (mieafungin,
amphotericin B, ﬂueytosine, ﬂuconazole, itraconazole, voriconazole and miconazole)
based on the Clinical Laboratory Standards Institute mierodilution method (19).

"11","3 ResuHs
3.1 Culture, identification and morphological
findings of fungal isolates

Molecular identiﬁcation indicated that 37 strains of fungi were isolated from MPCl,
MPC3, MPC4, and T-CBEF (Fig. 1, Table 1). N0 fungi were isolated from MPC2 0r
PSU. Each isolate showed 100% similarity to the DDBJ/EMBL/GenBank Accession
numbers at the DNA sequence level as unique species (Table 1). Morphological
observation of the slide cultures of these isolates showed no signiﬁcant differences from
the corresponding reference strain (data not shown). The dominant species among the
isolates belonged to the genera Penicillium, Aspergillus, and Cladosporium. In T-CBEF,
the ISS equipment had formed a richer fungal biota than MPC. The MPC3 (used in the
space shuttle) and MPC4 (used in the NASA mission) had greater varieties of fungi than
MPCI and 2 (used in the 188).

3.2 Antifungal susceptibility test
The results of antifungal susceptibility tests of isolates are shown in Table 2. Most of
the isolates showed sensitivity or intermediate sensitivity to mieafungin, amphotericin B,
itraconazole, and voriconazole. For T rametes elegans, the MEC 0f mieafungin was 8

ﬂucytosine, and voriconazole, Alternaria tenuissima and Paecilomyces variotii showed
resistance to voriconazole.

4 D is c u s s i o n
Previously, we performed fungal biota analysis of ISS “KIBO” (Opnum; Mierobe-I, II,
and III) and reported the results of Microbe-I mission (August — September 2009) (7).
N0 fungi were isolated from swabs obtained from the surfaces of equipment in the
KIBO area in this previous study. In the present study, however, several fungi were
isolated from dust collected from the inside and outside of equipment recovered from
the KIBO area of the 188.
Our results indicated that the environment of the 188 was cleaner than that of the Space
Shuttle, by comparing the Visual appearance of equipment and amount of isolated fungi.
However, these results also suggested that fungal contamination of the KIBO area was
progressing gradually.

1

"
"13","We did not detect fungi from MPC2 and PSU. MPC2 was hardly used in the ISS (JAXA
Associate Senior Engineer, personal communication). Dust had accumulated in the PSU,
but the Viability of fungi would have been decreased by heat in operation. In contrast,
large amounts of fungi were collected from T-CBEF in which a humidiﬁer was installed.
To maintain hygiene, it is important to clean areas with high humidity.
The variation of isolated fungi was similar to those in previous reports (3,4,20,21). The
dominant species of isolates belonged to the genera Penicillium, Aspergillus, and
Cladosporium. These are the most common components of the airborne fungal biota
that spread with spores (20), and are known as causative agents of allergy and
opportunistic infections (Table 1). In addition, Sordariomycetes fungi such as
endolichenic fungi were isolated, which can grow independently because they formed
spores 0n DG18 or PDA (data not shown). Their life cycle in such artiﬁcial
environment is obscure yet, but Sordariomycetes were isolated or detected from
spacecraft (Mir, Skylab and 188) (2, 4, 7, 22). Therefore, they are minority, but are

1

"
"14","members of the fungal biota 0f the spaceship.
The morphological phenotypes of each isolate determined by macro- and microscopic
examination were the same as those of the corresponding reference strains. The results
of antifungal agent susceptibility tests indicated no significant differences between the
fungal isolates and reported reference strains on Earth (21). Previously, we reported that
the morphological phenotypes and antifungal susceptibilities ofAspergillus niger and
Candida albicans did not change under conditions of simulated microgravity (23). Our
results suggested that fungi will not change their morphological or biological
characteristics easily under the stress of gravity and radiation during space ﬂight for a
few years.
There have been 110 reports of fungal isolates causing disorders among astronauts and/or
equipment 011 the 188. However, in this study we detected the progress of fungal
contamination in the ISS “KIBO” area by analysis of samples from equipment.
Sampling from equipment seems to be a useful and practical method for monitoring of

1

"
"15","the microbial condition of manned space environments. Further monitoring will be
necessary to protect the crew from health disorders and equipment problems in the 188.
