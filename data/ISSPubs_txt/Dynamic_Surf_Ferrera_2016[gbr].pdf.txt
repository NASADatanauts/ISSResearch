A very interesting example of g—jitter effects aboard the 155 is
the one that took place in the experiment Dynamic Surf conducted
on April 23th 2013 in the Fluid Physics Experiment Facility of the i ‘
Japanese Experiment Module (I(ibo). Large free surface oscillations F I :
were observed over several minutes before the experiment 5 3/1
started. The analysis of the accelerometers mounted on the same F ?_._/_'_______I___ ___x>

-0.025 1 We have characterized systematically the response of cylin—
drical liquid bridges to lateral perturbations by calculating the
maximum value of the transfer function for a wide range of

-0050 Ohnesorge numbers and different slendernesses. Experimenters
can use these results to predict the maximum liquid bridge de—
formation produced by vibrations with frequencies containing the

0.15 resonance one.

Taking into account these results, it might be advisable to
install some type of damper in the liquid bridge experimental
cell to eliminate perturbations with frequencies close to the

0.10 resonance frequency of the first lateral mode. This frequency can
be easily predicted from the slice model as a function of the liquid
AFmax bridge slenderness A [15]. This modification of the experimental
setup may become more important in studying the tiny free
0.05 surface oscillations caused by the Marangoni ﬂow [21,22], because
those oscillations might be obscured by the mechanical vibration.
Alternatively, one can unveil those oscillations in the experiment
“Mm by calculating the mechanical vibration from the accelerometer
