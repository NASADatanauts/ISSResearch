Administration (NCAA) and National Aeronautics and Space Administration

(NASA). He is currently leading the Ocean National Calibration/Validation

efforts for the satellite ocean Joint Polar Satellite System for NASA, NCAA,

and the U.S. Navy. He is coordinating the NRL hyperspectral satellite Hy—

perspectral Imaging of the Coastal Ocean, which was successfully launched

to the International Space Station (in August 2009). He serves on the Sci—

ence Teams for NASA, NOAA, the Environmental Protection Agency, and

the U.S. Navy for developing future satellite systems and for establishing

policy for ocean and coastal research. He has been an Adjunct Faculty

Member with the Marine Science Department, The University of Southern

Mississippi (USM), Hattiesburg, since 1989 and the University of South

Alabama, and serves 011 graduate student committees (USM and Rosenstiel

School of Marine and Atmospheric Sciences). He has developed bio—optical

algorithms for satellites, which are applied to ecological forecasting mod—

els. He has received U.S. Department of Navy patents (1980). He has over

90 scientiﬁc publications and more than 250 presentations. His speciﬁc exper—

tise is in coupling biological, optical, and physical processes using ocean color

satellite and ocean models.

Mr. Arnone was the recipient of awards for naval honors for “science to

operations” transitions and NRL Alan Berman publication awards. He has

received NASA honors for astronaut training programs, U.S. Department of

Navy honors, and NASA honors for Shuttle Astronaut Training program. He

was also the recipient of the Navy Meritorious Civilian Service Award in 2008,

U.S. Navy Employee of the Year in 1998, Navy Royalty Transition Award
