KEYWORDS Summary
Azuki bean . . . . . .
V' l . . The effects of accelerated grav1ty st1mul1 on the cell wall-bound perox1dase act1v1ty
(Cllglna i133” ans), and the lignin content were investigated along epicotyls of azuki bean (Vigna
He wa ’ 't . angularis) seedlings. The endogenous growth occurred primarily in the upper regions
Lyp?r$ra‘"" y, of the epicotyl, but no growth was detected in the middle or basal regions.
Plgmno,d Hypergravity treatment at 3003 for 6 h suppressed elongation growth and stimulated
erox1 as e lateral expansion of the upper regions. The content of acetyl bromide-soluble lignin
increased gradually from the apical to the basal regions of epicotyls. Hypergravity
treatment stimulated the increase in the lignin content in epicotyls, particularly in
the middle and basal regions. The peroxidase activity in the protein fraction
extracted with a high ionic strength buffer from the cell wall preparation also
increased gradually toward the basal region, and hypergravity treatment increased
the activity in all epicotyl regions. There was a close correlation between the lignin
content and the enzyme activity. These results suggest that hypergravity increases
the activity of cell wall-bound peroxidase followed by increases of the lignin
formation in epicotyl cell walls, which may contribute to increasing the rigidity of
cell walls against the gravitational force.
