parameters a = 100.64. b = 107.78. c = 179.82 A. Diffraction spots to
1.26 A resolution were observed. Unfortunately. the high-resolution
diffraction degraded owing to radiation damage and the resolution
limit for the complete data set was 1.35 A. It is anticipated that
increasing the crystal volume and diffraction limit through micro-
gravity crystal growth will enable several types of technically
challenging structure determinations.
