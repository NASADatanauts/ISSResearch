Color pictures of sprites from non-dedicated observation on board
the International Space Station
Augustin Jehl,1 Thomas Farges,1 and Elisabeth Blane1
Received 20 July 2012; revised 22 November 2012; accepted 28 November 2012; published 25 January 2013.
[1] Very recently NASA astronauts took a new set of pictures from the International Space
Station during night time in the frame of the NASA Crew Earth Observations program,
giving a new opportunity to observe in color sprites and their parent lightning ﬂashes.
During about 20 h of observations, nondireetly dedicated to thunderstorm studies, 15 sprites
were observed from August 2011 to April 2012. Chromatic observations allow analyzing
thoroughly the main components of the sprite radiation. The red and green emissions,
observed in all the sprite images, are due to the radiation of the ﬁrst positive band system of
molecular nitrogen N2. The blue emission, present in only 2 out of 15 sprites, is produced
by the radiation of bands of the second positive band system of N2 and bands of the ﬁrst
negative band system of N; ions. It indicates the possible presence of ionization in these
two sprites. The sprite brightness is equivalent to the Jupiter one.
