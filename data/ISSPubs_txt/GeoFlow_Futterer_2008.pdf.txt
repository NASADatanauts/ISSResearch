Abstract
We present numerical and experimental preliminary studies for a microgravity experiment on thermal convection in rotating
spherical shells named GeOFlow, Which Will be integrated in Fluid Science Laboratory (FSL) at Columbus module of International
Space Station (188). Numerical studies of this spherical Rayleigh—Benard problem under a central dielectrophoretic force in
microgravity environment are accomplished for a Wide range of Rayleigh and Taylor number. For testing GeOFlow framework a
laboratory experiment is designed, constructed, and tested including set—up of Optical measurement technique (Wollaston shearing
interferometry).
