29 Abstract
30 Removal of the normal head-to-foot gravity vector and chronic weightlessness during spaceflight might
31 induce cardiovascular and metabolic adaptations related to changes in arterial pressure and reduction in
32 physical activity. We tested hypotheses that stiffness of arteries located above the heart would be
33 increased post-flight, and that blood biomarkers inflight would be consistent with changes in vascular
34 function. Possible sex-differences in responses were explored in four male and four female astronauts
35 who lived on the International Space Station for six-months. Carotid artery distensibility coefficient (P =
36 0.005) and B-stiffness index (P = 0.006) reflected 17-30% increases in arterial stiffness when measured
37 within 38 hours of return to Earth compared to pre-flight. Spaceflight by sex interaction effects were
38 found with greater changes in B-stiffness index in women (P = 0.017), but greater changes in pulse wave
39 transit time in men (P = 0.006). Several blood biomarkers were changed from pre-flight to inflight,
40 including an increase in an index of insulin resistance (P < 0.001) with a spaceflight by sex term
41 suggesting greater change in men (P = 0.034). Spaceflight by sex interactions for renin (P = 0.016) and
42 aldosterone (P = 0.010) indicated greater increases in women than men. Six months spaceflight caused
43 increased arterial stiffness. Altered hydrostatic arterial pressure gradients as well as changes in insulin
44 resistance and other biomarkers might have contributed to alterations in arterial properties included
45 sex-differences between male and female astronauts.
46 New and noteworthy
47 Male and female astronauts return from 6-months spaceflight with an increase in carotid artery stiffness
48 similar to more than 10-20 years of normal aging. They also shows signs of developing insulin resistance
49 during spaceflight. Between sex differences were observed for several key markers that reflect vascular
50 health.

"3","57 Introduction
58 Human spaceflight has the potential to markedly alter cardiovascular structure and function relative to
59 the normal values of an active, healthy adult. In the upright posture on Earth, hydrostatic gradients
6O reduce arterial pressures above the heart and increase pressures below the heart inducing regionally
61 specific arterial adaptations (39). Arteries also respond to the level of physical activity with regionally-
62 specific vascular adaptations (50). Spaceflight removes the head-to-foot gravitational vector and
63 dramatically reduces daily physical activity requirements (9) so that vascular changes are expected (61).
64 Head down bed rest (HDBR), a spaceflight analog, reduced superficial femoral artery diameter (3, 56)
65 and increased wall thickness of carotid and superficial femoral arteries (55). Physical inactivity during
66 spaceflight might be expected to increase arterial stiffness and also affect cardio-metabolic biomarkers
67 including insulin as observed with sedentary lifestyles on Earth (13, 42). Insulin resistance has been
68 identified in HDBR (14), but data from spaceflight have not been conclusive (25, 47, 48).
69 Little is known about structural adaptations of human arteries to spaceflight. Following 5-18 day
70 spaceflights, tota| arterial compliance calculated from stroke volume divided by arterial pulse pressure
71 was reduced (stiffer arteries) in some astronauts (53). However, tota| arterial compliance is a function of
72 central and peripheral artery stiffness so this calculation could have reflected peripheral sympathetic
73 vasoconstriction rather than changes in central arteries. The pulse wave transit time (PWTT) measured
74 from the R-wave of the electrocardiogram to the arrival of the pulse in the fingertip was significantly
75 reduced inflight (stiffer arteries) and at 5-days post-flight (2). In contrast with these studies, a recent
76 report from long-duration spaceflight found a reduction in systemic vascular resistance and an elevated
77 stroke volume with no change in arterial pulse pressure (34), observations that imply greater arterial
78 compliance.
79 Animal models provide some insight into potential mechanisms of vascular adaptations to Earth-based
8O analogs and spaceflight. Head-down ti|t tai| suspension of rats (65, 67) caused hypertrophy of smooth
81 muscle in cerebral arteries and atrophy of arterial walls in the hind limbs. A mechanism underlying
82 hypertrophy of the rat cerebral arteries might be activation of the wall angiotensin converting enzyme
83 (67), while in the aorta of head-down ti|t rats, enzymatic extracellular matrix cross-Iinking contributed to
84 increased arterial stiffness (54).
85 The possibility of sex- and/or species-differences in arterial responses was raised in recent
86 investigations. Female mice in space for 13-days had increased distensibility of the cerebral arteries

"4","87 compared to ground controls (49), while male mice in space for 30-days had less distensible cerebral
88 arteries (44). It is possible that the responses of mice reflect a sex or species effect as female mice
89 studied by these same investigators with the head-down ti|t model had no change in vascular
90 distensibilty or medial wall thickness (49) in contrast to male rats (65, 68).
91 The combination of altered gravitational stress and overall physical unloading during spaceflight might
92 contribute to changes in arterial properties through various mechanisms, some of which could be similar
93 to arteria| stiffening on Earth (31, 32, 70). The current study measured carotid artery stiffness and the
94 PWTT in astronauts before and after living 5-6 months on the International Space Station (ISS). We
95 tested the hypotheses that arteries in the upper region of the body would be stiffer after spaceflight,
96 and that blood biomarkers would reflect the development of insulin resistance and changes in the
97 hormonal milieu that could affect vascular structure and function. In addition, through the serendipitous
98 assignment of astronauts over the period of this study we enrolled an equal number of male and female
99 astronauts providing a unique opportunity to explore potential sex-differences in vascular responses.

101 Methods:
102 Study participants and design
103 Nine astronauts (4 female, 40 — 56 years old, 174:7 cm height, 69:15 kg body weight) volunteered to
104 participate in this study known by the operations name ”Vascular”. The experiment was selected
105 through international peer review in 2004. Each astronaut gave informed consent to a proposal that was
106 reviewed and approved by five autonomous Ethics Review Boards: the Office of Research Ethics at the
107 University of Waterloo, the NASA Institutional Review Board (IRB), the NASA Human Research Medical
108 Review Board (HRMRB), the European Space Agency Medical Review Board and the Japanese Space
109 Agency Medical Review Board (NASA MPA 7116301606HR; FWA 00019876). The experiments
110 conformed to the guidelines of the Declaration of Helsinki.
111 Participants were asked to avoid alcohol, blood pressure medications, and coId/allergy medications for
112 24 hours prior to the test. Participants arrived at least 2 hours post prandiaI/post caffeine and at least 2
113 weeks since their last leg biopsy. No strenuous exercise and no ti|t tests/test that interfere with the
114 blood pressure responses of daily life were performed within 24 hours prior to the sessions. Crew were
115 permitted, however, to follow their normal dain/weekly fitness regime.

"5","116 The pre-flight baseline physiology session was completed at Johnson Space Center between 57 and 96
117 days before launch; two blood samples were collected 24 - 105 days before launch (Johnson Space
118 Center or Star City, Russia and stored at -80° C prior to shipment on dry ice). All astronauts launched and
119 landed on the Russian Soyuz; one astronaut completed the physiology testing post-flight at Star City,
120 Russia, all others at Johnson Space Center. Post-flight physiological sessions occurred approximately 22-
121 38 hours post-Ianding. Total flight lengths ranged from 146-193 days, and inflight blood samples were
122 collected between 99-159 days into the mission. All physiological testing and blood sampling was
123 completed between July 2009 and November 2013. Blood samples were returned to Earth on four
124 occasions between April 2010 and June 2014 for analysis in two sessions (first 4 astronauts: 2012-2013
125 and final 5 astronauts: 2014-2015).
126 The conditions on the ISS were similar to those described recently (34). Each astronaut participated in a
127 regular fitness program including aerobic (cycle ergometer and treadmill) and resistive (Advanced
128 Resistive Exercise Device) exercises. A summary of the activities for each astronaut while on ISS is
129 provided in Table 1.
130 Physiological variables
131 Pre- and post-flight supine instrumentation included an electrocardiogram (ECG Module, Finapres
132 Medical Systems, Arnhem, Netherlands) and continuous arterial blood pressure by finger cuff
133 plethysmography (Finometer PRO or Portapres) recorded on a computerized data recording system
134 (PowerLab, LabChart 5.4.2, AD Instruments, Colorado Springs, CO, USA). The finger arterial blood
135 pressure was calibrated by the ipsilateral brachial return-to—flow method (Finometer PRO) or by
136 standard arm cuff sphygmomanometry obtained from the contralateral brachial artery (Portapres). The
137 carotid artery pulse pressure was determined using applanation tonometry (SPT-301, Millar
138 Instruments, Houston, TX, USA) from the left common carotid artery while time-motion ultrasound
139 images were obtained simultaneously from the right artery. Carotid pulse pressure was computed
140 assuming equivalent mean and diastolic blood pressures in the brachial and carotid arteries (23). The
141 posterior tibial artery pulse wave was measured with a pulse transducer (TN1012/ST, AD Instruments).
142 Estimates of peripheral artery pulse wave transit times were obtained from the timing from the peak of
143 the R-wave of the electrocardiogram to the foot of the pressure waves of the finger cuff, and the
144 posterior tibial artery. The foot of the pressure wave was identified as the peak of the second derivative
145 of the pressure waveforms from a 7 point moving window after initial Iow-pass filtering at 15 Hz.

"6","146 Ultrasound investigation
147 The right common carotid artery was imaged in longitudinal and/or cross section with B-mode and time
148 motion (M-mode) ultrasound. Over the duration of the study, three different devices were used: GE
149 LOGIQ Book XP (GE Healthcare Products, Milwaukee, WI, USA) using an 8 MHz linear transducer;
150 Sonosite MicroMaxx (Sonosite |nc., Bothell, WA, USA) using a HFL38 6-13 MHz transducer; Mindray M5
151 (Mindray Bio—Medical Electronics Co., Shenzhen CN) using a L14-6s 8-12 MHz transducer. Images were
152 recorded to the internal memory of the ultrasound devices or video tape. All images used for the carotid
153 distensibility calculations were independently assessed, without reference to subject or condition, by
154 two trained technicians to measure minimal diastolic and peak systolic diameter taken from intima to
155 intima boundaries; any disagreement (>0.025 cm) was resolved by consensus of the two technicians and
156 the senior investigator.
157 Carotid artery stiffness indicators were obtained from the distensibility coefficient (CDC) and B-stiffness
158 indicator, an assessment of arterial stiffness that accounts for the nonlinear arterial compliance to
159 pressure relationship (21).
160 CDC = (Ds2 — Dd2) / (PP * Dd2)
161 B: [|n(Ps/Pd)] / [(Ds — Dd) / Dd]
162 Where Ds = systolic diameter, Dd = diastolic diameter, PP = arterial pulse pressure, Ps = systolic pressure
163 and Pd = diastolic pressure. For calculation of CDC both brachial and carotid PP were used as noted. The
164 B-stiffness is reported only with carotid PP.
165 Blood analyses
166 Blood samples were taken after an overnight fast (minimum 8 hour) twice pre-flight and twice during
167 the final month of flight, spaced apart by a minimum of 48 hours and at least 48 hours after
168 experimental procedures that might induce inflammation or any diet/electrolyte/fluid manipulation.
169 Draws were also separated from any sleep shifts greater than three hours in length by minimum of three
170 days (e.g. trans-ocean flights, extra-vehicular activities, docking/undocking affecting sleep patterns).
171 Blood was seIf-collected (on ISS) into Vacutainer® gel separator tubes for serum and plasma. Serum
172 samples were allowed to clot for 20 mins and all tubes were centrifuged within 30 min, and stored at -
173 80°C until returned to University of Waterloo laboratory for analysis. The two pre-flight or the inflight
174 samples were averaged to reduce variability and minimize the impact of pulsatile secretions such as

176 the concentration of the biomarker.
177 Glucose was measured in plasma (Sigma-Aldrich, Oakville, Canada). Insulin was measured in serum
178 (Coat-a-Count Insulin Assay kit, Intermedico Diagnostic Products, Toronto, Canada) and units converted
179 from uIU/mL to pmoI/L with the factor 6.0 (15). The homeostatic model assessment index of insulin
180 resistance (HOMA-IR) was calculated as: HOMA-IR = ([glucose, mmoI/L] * [insulin, uIU/mL] / 22.5 (28).
181 The new HOMA-Z model was not used as several insulin values were outside the limits of the equation
182 (60). Glycated albumin was measured in plasma (Glycated Albumin Assay Kit 80419, Crystal Chem,
183 Downers Grove, IL, USA) and expressed as a percentage of the total albumin concentration. Insulin-Iike
184 growth factor-1 was measured in plasma (Human |GF-1 Quantikine ELISA kit, R&D Systems, Minneapolis,
185 MN, USA). Receptor for advanced glycation end-products (RAGE) was measured in plasma (Human RAGE
186 ELISA, RayBiotech, Norcross, GA, USA). Highly sensitive C-reactive protein (hs-CRP) was measured in
187 plasma (C-Reactive Protein ELISA, ALPCO, Salem, NH, USA). Interleukin-1 receptor antagonist (|L-1ra)
188 was measured in serum (|L-1ra/IL-1F3 Quantikine ELISA kit, R&D Systems, Minneapolis, MN, USA). Total
189 antioxidants and superoxide dismutase (SOD) were measured in serum (Antioxidant Assay Kit,
190 Superoxide Dismutase Assay Kit, Cayman Chemical Company, Ann Arbor, MI, USA). Serum
191 concentrations of triglycerides (TG), total cholesterol (TC) and high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-
192 C) (Pointe Scientific, Canton, MI, USA) were used in the calculation of Iow-density lipoprotein cholesterol
193 with the Friedewald equation (LDL-C = TC — HDL-C — (TG/2.2)). Renin was measured in plasma (Renin
194 ELISA, DRG International, Springfield, NJ, USA). Angiotensin-II was measured in plasma (ELISA, Bertin
195 Pharma, Montigny |e Bretonneux, France). Aldosterone was measured in serum (Coat-a-Count,
196 Intermedico Diagnostic Products, Toronto, Canada). Atrial natriuretic peptide (pro—ANP) was measured
197 in plasma (pro-ANP ELISA, Biomedica Medizinprodukte GmbH, Vienna, Austria). Matrix
198 metalloproteinase-2 (MMP-Z, as well as MMP-1 and MMP-9 for the first four astronauts only) was
199 measured in serum (Total MMP-Z Quantikine ELISA kit, R&D Systems, Minneapolis, MN, USA).

206 p < 0.05 and trends for differences at p < 0.10. Linear regression models were employed to test for

207 relationships between pairs of variables. All analyses were completed with SigmaPlot 12.5.0.38 (Systat

208 Software, Inc.).

209

210 Results

211 After collecting all data, we were informed that one male astronaut modified medications between

212 baseline and subsequent testing. Several variables for this individual changed in opposite directions

213 from all others so he has been excluded from all analyses. His exercise data are included in Table 1 to

214 provide additional insight into astronaut exercise routines.

215 Pre-flight to Post-flight Cardiovascular Responses

216 Resting supine heart rate was significantly elevated during testing approximately 24h post-flight

217 compared to pre-flight baseline (Table 2). The significant Flight * Sex interaction effect for SBP reflected

218 the decrease in SBP after spaceflight for women and an increase for men. There were no Flight effects

219 observed for DBP, brachial PP or carotid PP (Table 2).

220 Carotid artery stiffness was significantly increased post-flight compared to pre-flight baseline. The

221 carotid distensibility coefficient when calculated with the carotid artery pulse pressure [cDC(cPP)] was

222 reduced 17.1i23.5% post-flight (Table 2). The carotid artery distensibility coefficient when calculated

223 with the brachial artery pulse pressure [cDC(bPP)] was reduced 25.9i14.1% (Table 2, Figure 1). The

224 carotid artery B-stiffness index calculated with carotid pulse pressure was increased 29.6ir34.0% post-

225 flight with a significant Flight * Sex interaction effect due to the greater increase in women (Table 2).

226 The percent changes in carotid artery distensibility coefficient and the B-stiffness index were correlated

227 (cDC(cPP): r2 = 0.42, P=0.08; cDC(bPP): r2 = 0.63, P=0.018). The percent change in B-stiffness index from

228 pre- to post-flight tended to correlate with the change in PWTT measured from R-wave to pulse

229 pressure arrival in the ankle (r2=0.45, P=0.070).

230 The PWTT measured from the R-wave of the ECG to the initial upslope of the finger blood pressure

231 waveform was significantly faster after flight with a strong Flight * Sex interaction effect reflecting the

232 greater reduction in PWTT in men (Table 2, Figure 2). A similar pattern with a significant Flight * Sex

233 interaction effect was observed for the PWTT measured from the R-wave to the arrival of the pressure

235 individual comparing pre-flight to post-flight were significantly correlated (r2=0.546, P=0.036)
236 Pre-flight to Inflight Blood Biomarkers
237 Metabolic markers related to glucose metabolism were altered by spaceflight (Table 3, Figure 3).
238 Although there was no overall change in blood glucose concentration, there were differences between
239 men and women and there was a significant Flight * Sex interaction effect revealing a trend for women
240 to have lower blood glucose inflight and men to have higher blood glucose. Insulin concentration was
241 elevated in all astronauts, and calculated HOMA insulin resistance index increased overall with a Flight *
242 Sex interaction suggesting a greater increase in men than women (Figure 3). Glycated albumin
243 expressed as a percentage of total albumin tended to be elevated inflight, IGF-l was increased inflight
244 with a significant Flight * Sex interaction effect consistent with a greater increase in men than women,
245 and RAGE was significantly reduced during spaceflight. The change from pre-flight to inflight for blood
246 glucose was significantly correlated to the change in glycated albumin (Figure 4, r2 = 0.52, P = 0.04).
247 Several of the measured fluid regulatory and blood pressure affecting hormones were also changed by
248 spaceflight (Table 3, Figure 5). Renin was elevated by spaceflight with a significant Flight * Sex
249 interaction as women tended to increase more than men. Angiotensin-II was not significantly affected
250 by spaceflight. Aldosterone was increased overall, but a significant Flight * Sex interaction revealed a
251 greater increase in women than in men. Pro—ANP was reduced during spaceflight.
252 Markers of inflammatory and oxidative stress were inconsistently affected by spaceflight (Table 3). C-
253 reactive protein was not changed from pre-flight to inflight. |L-1ra was elevated during spaceflight. Total
254 antioxidants and SOD were not significantly affected by spaceflight; however, SOD had a trend for a
255 Flight * Sex interaction as women tended to increase while men decreased.
256 A marker of growth and repair obtained from measurement of MMP-2 revealed a significant
257 suppression during spaceflight (Table 3), while MMP-1 and MMP-9 were not significantly changed (n=4,
258 data not shown).
259
260 Discussion
261 These first observations of carotid artery properties after Iong-duration spaceflight supported our main
262 hypothesis that arteries located above the heart would be stiffer; the carotid distensibility coefficient

9

"10","263 was reduced and the B-stiffness index was increased. The primary mechanisms underlying these
264 changes were probably related to the chronic elevation in carotid artery blood pressure and physical
265 inactivity which might affect blood biomarkers associated with increased carotid arterial stiffness. As
266 hypothesized blood insulin was elevated and calculated index of insulin resistance was increased, the
267 latter revealed a significant Flight * Sex interaction effect as a consequence of directionally different
268 changes in fasting blood glucose. Significant Flight * Sex interactions were also observed for several
269 physiological variables and blood markers including renin and aldosterone. As noted for spaceflight
270 experiments (36), the small sample size, especially for the comparison of sex-differences, introduces a
271 need for caution in the interpretation of these findings.
272 Vascular adaptations to spaceflight
273 Loss of hydrostatic gradient that normally reduces arterial pressure above the heart and increases it
274 below the heart while in upright posture on Earth could affect arterial structure during spaceflight (61,
275 67). In this study, we focused on the carotid artery as a reflection of change occurring in vessels above
276 the heart where hypertrophy would be anticipated (65, 68). By displaying the individual astronaut
277 changes with respect to the general population (Figure 1), it is apparent that the average increase in
278 arterial stiffness indicator measured approximately 24-hours after return from 6-months in space was
279 the equivalent to the change seen with more than 20-years of normal aging (10). While some of the
280 mechanisms for change are certainly different between spaceflight and aging, the magnitude of change
281 is rather dramatic. In the current study, there were no significant differences in arterial blood pressure
282 from pre- to post-flight, although a significant Flight * Sex interaction term for systolic blood pressure
283 reflected small decreases in women and increases in men. To avoid potential blood pressure confounds,
284 we also used the B-stiffness index (21) and again observed significantly increased stiffness after
285 spaceflight. However, the change in stiffness was more modest and equivalent to approximately 10-
286 years of normal aging compared to the Japanese population (21). The two indicators were significantly
287 correlated, but there were some differences and a significant Flight * Sex interaction for the B-stiffness
288 index with greater changes in women.
289 We did not specifically evaluate post-flight alterations in sympathetic nervous system activity that might
290 have affected our measurements of arterial stiffness. However, absence of increases in blood pressure
291 and only a small increase in heart rate that could have been mediated by reduced parasympathetic
292 activity suggest that this mechanism was unlikely to contribute.

10

"11","293
294 Increased arterial stiffness with aging is associated with multiple factors. Hypertension can cause
295 vascular wall hypertrophy that restores circumferential wall stress (12). The animal model analog of
296 spaceflight with chronic elevation of arterial pressure during hind-Iimb suspension confirmed the
297 hypertrophic response (65, 68) and suggested decreased carotid artery compliance (20). However, aging
298 is also associated with loss of elastic tissue and increased collagen in large arteries (31). It is unlikely that
299 breakdown of elastic tissue contributes to arterial stiffness with 6-months spaceflight and it is unknown
300 if collagen content changes.
301 Prior to this study, the only evidence for increased arterial stiffness with spaceflight came from
302 measurements of shorter PWTT from the R-wave to the arrival of the finger pulse in 8 male cosmonauts
303 during and for up to 6-days after 6-months on ISS (2). We found similar shortening of PWTT immediately
304 after spaceflight, but a significant Flight * Sex interaction effect revealed relatively no change in women.
305 PWTT to the ankle also had a significant Flight * Sex effect but no main effect of Flight. Reduction in
306 arterial pressure below the heart might cause vascular atrophy. However, additional confounding
307 factors related to cardiac stroke volume, cardiac ejection period, sympathetic nervous system activity or
308 blood borne factors might affect PWTT.
309 Cardiac stroke volume increased up to 35% during spaceflight with respect to the upright position on
310 Earth (34). Peripheral vasodilation might occur as brachial artery pressure was reduced 8-10 mmHg
311 during 24-h ambulatory data collection (34). However, other research noted no reduction in finger
312 arterial pressure during spaceflight (18, 57). A reduction in resting blood pressure might reduce, but not
313 | eliminate, the change in pressure proposed to stimulate change at the carotid artery.
314 Blood biomarker responses to spaceflight
315 Impaired glucose metabolism can contribute to increased arterial stiffness (64, 70). Research in the
316 19705 suggested that blood glucose and insulin were reduced after 38 days of spaceflight (25). In the
317 19905, Stein et al. (47) reported insulin resistance from the first Spacelab Life Sciences mission, but on
318 combining data from subsequent short-duration shuttle missions they stated ”that no major changes
319 were found with insulin production” (48). We report here for the first time a significant increase in the
320 calculated homeostatic model assessment of insulin resistance (HOMA-IR) with a significant Flight * Sex
321 interaction effect that reflects the small but consistent increase in men’s blood glucose with no change
322 or small reduction for women, while both sexes increased insulin.

11

"
"12","323 In a recent 21-day head-down bed rest, HOMA-IR was not affected but insulin sensitivity was reduced
324 during an oral glucose tolerance test (14). The HOMA-IR reflects the balance between hepatic glucose
325 output and insulin secretion while the oral glucose tolerance test largely reflects glucose uptake by
326 skeletal muscle (1, 60). Since impaired skeletal muscle glucose uptake is proposed as the primary
327 mechanism of insulin resistance with bed rest, future studies of spaceflight should directly evaluate
328 post-prandial glucose homeostasis.
329 A potential short-term marker of glucose regulation is blood glycated albumin (22). A trend to elevated
330 glycated albumin was observed during spaceflight which might reflect developing insulin resistance as
331 well as the diet high in simple sugars consumed by astronauts in an attempt to maintain tota| caloric
332 intake (46). Advanced glycation end products (AGE) interact with receptors for advanced glycation end
333 products (RAGE) causing increased oxidative stress and vascular damage (66). In the current study we
334 observed a reduction of RAGE with spaceflight which could decrease the AGE-RAGE interaction
335 potentially reducing oxidative stress. Insulin-Iike growth factor 1 (|GF-1) , a cardio-protective molecule
336 (16), was significantly increased by spaceflight with a Flight * Sex interaction effect reflecting the
337 relatively greater increase in men. Tota| antioxidants were not changed and there was a trend for a
338 Flight * Sex interaction for superoxide dismutase suggesting women had a relative increase with
339 spaceflight. Crucian et al. (6) recently presented a broad description of inflammatory responses during
340 long-duration spaceflight. They also found elevated |L-1ra, a constitutively expressed anti-inflammatory
341 cytokine that might reflect a response to localized inflammation. C-reactive protein was not altered in
342 the current study but a consistent reduction was found inflight in a larger group of men (71). Oxidative
343 stress and inflammation have been hypothesized as potential factors affecting musculoskeletal and
344 vascular hea|th during long-duration spaceflights (37, 45, 58, 71). The absence of oxidative stress in the
345 current study might simply reflect the small sample size.
346 There were no changes in total cholesterol, high density or low density lipoproteins, but there was a
347 reduction in triglycerides with a significant Flight * Sex interaction as men had a greater decrease. This
348 was probably a reflection of the change in diet with spaceflight (46) although we have no data for
349 dietary intake in these astronauts. Within the first 24-hours after return from space reductions were
350 found in triglyceride, total cholesterol and high density lipoprotein (27). No effect on vascular structure
351 or function would be anticipated from the relatively consistent blood lipids in the current study.
352 | The roles of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system and atrial natriuretic peptide have been
353 frequently explored for maintenance of a smaller total blood volume in space (8, 24, 25, 33).

12

"
"13","354 Aldosterone also contributes to potassium excretion (38) that could be important as muscle atrophy
355 | occurs with spaceflight (46). Angiotensin-II causes endothelial dysfunction (30), aldosterone induces
356 vascular wall hypertrophy, fibrosis and alters endothelial function (5) and blockade of the renin-
357 angiotensin-aldosterone system can ”de-stiffen” central arteries (41). Local activation of the renin-
358 angiotensin-aldosterone system plays a critical role in vascular hypertrophy in carotid and cerebral
359 | arteries in the spaceflight analog of hind-limb suspended rats (69). increased renin and aldosterone, and
360 reduced atrial natriuretic peptide are consistent with previous spaceflight studies. To the best of our
361 knowledge this is the first time that a difference has been identified between men and women (24).
362 Whether the greater increase of aldosterone in women contributed to the increase in the B-stiffness
363 index in their carotid arteries remains to be determined.
364 Arterial structural changes can also include the extracellular matrix in addition to smooth muscle cell
365 hypertrophy. Increased collagen content and enzyme-mediated extracellular matrix cross-links have
366 been observed in the aorta of rats following 7 days hind-limb suspension (54). Non-enzyme cross-link
367 formation associated with glycation end-products was not observed in this previous study. The
368 increased carotid artery stiffness of the current study was found concurrently with reduced serum
369 MMP-Z. Directionally consistent with the current findings, a negative association was found between
370 MMP-2 and arterial stiffness determined by pulse wave velocity (59). It is not clear whether the changes
371 in serum MMP-Z with spaceflight reflect changes in vascular walls versus unloading effects on other
372 tissues (26). Further, the only other investigation of MMP-2 changes in spaceflight reported increased
373 expression in lung tissues of female mice along with thickened blood vessel walls (51).
374
375 Physical inactivity and other risks in spaceflight
376 We confirmed here that astronauts perform aerobic exercises for only about 30 min per day within a
377 lifestyle that has greatly reduced overall daily activity compared to pre-flight (9). Reduced activity can
378 affect maximum oxygen uptake (29), skeletal muscle function and bone loss (43, 52). In this study, the
379 concern is that the relatively sedentary lifestyle of an astronaut can be compared to the modern
380 epidemic of sedentary behavior associated with high incidence of cardio-metabolic disease (4, 35). Our
381 results suggest that the overall physical inactivity during 6-month spaceflights might contribute to
382 development of stiffer arteries and early signs of insulin resistance.

13

"
"14","383 An additional risk factor for cardiovascular disease is radiation (40). The extent to which radiation might
384 contribute in spaceflight to changes such as those observed in the current investigation of vascular and
385 blood biomarkers is unknown but is considered an important problem by NASA (7).
386
387 Sex differences
388 Women have poorer orthostatic tolerance than men on return from space (62). Little is known about
389 other sex-based cardiovascular differences with spaceflight (37). We identified significant Flight * Sex
390 differences for arterial stiffness indicators. However, the direction of difference was not consistent
391 between measurements. There were no differences between men and women for the carotid
392 distensibility coefficient, while the B-stiffness index increased more in women than men. The opposite
393 direction of change was observed for the PWTT with greater post-flight reduction in transit time in men
394 than women. The carotid artery stiffness reflects change in a large elastic artery whi|e pulse wave transit
395 time reflects the composite effects of central elastic and peripheral muscular arteries that might be
396 affected by sympathetic vasoconstriction and regional differences in transmural pressures. Female sex
397 hormones affect arterial stiffness (17), but contraceptive or menstrual cycle information was not
398 available for the women (ages 41 — 50 years) in the current study.
399 There were sex differences in biomarkers that could potentially minimize the increased arterial stiffness
400 with spaceflight such as the smaller increase in HOMA-IR or the trend to greater increase in superoxide
401 dismutase in women; but, there were also changes in biomarkers that could exaggerate the effects on
402 women including the smaller increase in IGF-1 and the greater increase in aldosterone. Interpretation of
403 results in the current study that included only 4 women requires caution, however women were equally
404 represented in the most recent recruitment by NASA (37) providing incentive for future investigations of
405 sex-related factors for cardiovascular health.
406
407 Methodological considerations and limitations
408 The major limitation of spaceflight research is the small sample size (36) and the limited access to
409 astronauts, especially women. The current study was allocated 45-minutes in the first day after landing
410 to complete the ultrasound investigations thus restricting the measurements that could be made.

14

"
"15","411 Spaceflight research is also complicated by the lack of control over many potentially confounding
412 factors. In this study, we hypothesized that arterial pressure was chronically elevated at the level of the
413 carotid artery during spaceflight. We did not make measurements of arterial pressure and have only
414 data from previous investigations showing maintenance (19, 57) or reduction (34) in blood pressure. If
415 the latter occurred, then the chronic increase in arterial pressure at the carotid artery would have been
416 less than proposed by a simple removal of hydrostatic effect.
417 Astronauts have individual exercise regimes and diets (46), and they participate in many experiments
418 and medical evaluations necessitating constraints to avoid complex interactions. Of particular concern
419 to the current study is the individual variability in preparation for and response to return from space.
420 Most astronauts participate in fluid-loading immediately prior to return (63), and each astronaut
421 receives post-flight medical care determined by his/her own physician. Some received anti-nausea
422 medications and were given up to 3.5 L of intravenous saline to overcome symptoms of orthostatic
423 hypotension, all were encouraged to drink large quantities of water. One male astronaut completed
424 post-flight testing in Star City, Russia, but all others experienced ”direct return” which describes flying
425 the astronaut, mostly in a recumbent or supine position, with two brief refueling stops directly to
426 Johnson Space Center in Houston. Post-flight testing occurred early the morning after their return but
427 circadian rhythm was disrupted.
428 All of the physiological measurements reported in the current study were conducted in the supine
429 posture pre- and post-flight. This should have minimized effects of altered blood volume and baroreflex
430 function. Indeed, there were no spaceflight effects on estimates of stroke volume and cardiac output, or
431 on arterial blood pressure which could be important because of the nonlinear nature of the vascular
432 pressure-area relationship (21). Additionally, carotid stiffness indices are strongly affected by ultrasound
433 measurements. We utilized consistent methods to image the artery but there were advancements in
434 ultrasound technology over the 4-years of the study.
435 Measurement of PWTT was dependent on accurate assessment of the arrival of the pulse in the finger
436 and ankle. Differences in pulse pressure waveform from pre- to post-flight might have affected
437 detection by the second-derivative method.
438
439 Perspectives

15

"
"16","440 Astronauts are considered to be a population of exceptional health, but within the astronaut corps there
441 are individuals with risk factors for atherosclerosis (11). Given the current observations of increased
442 arterial stiffness and changes in blood biomarkers that could promote atherosclerotic development,
443 future research can focus on mechanisms and risk factors that could potentiallyjeopardize the health
444 and safety of astronauts as space exploration continues. Future space exploration missions are being
445 planned with relatively small capsules for travel to the Moon and beyond. The physical size constraints
446 as well as the need to supply sufficient food and water to support the levels of physical activity
447 necessary to maintain health will severely challenge the space program to maintain an astronaut’s
448 cardio-metabolic health.
449 From an Earth-based perspective, the observations of rapid changes in arterial properties and
450 development of characteristics of insulin resistance in healthy astronauts can be used to point to links
451 between sedentary lifestyles and vascular aging. Given the new knowledge gained from the current
452 study, future investigations of astronauts can focus on exercise and nutrition-based interventions to
453 maintain health. In turn, these interventions in astronauts can provide advice relevant for maintenance
454 of optimal health in the general population.
455
456 Conclusions
457 Consistent with our primary hypothesis, astronauts returned from 6-months spaceflight with greater
458 carotid arterial stiffness. The pre- to post-flight changes in carotid distensibility coefficient and B-
459 stiffness index observed during Iong-duration spaceflight were equivalent to the increases in stiffness
460 observed with more than 10-20 years aging in reference populations on Earth (10, 21). The change in
461 pulse wave transit time was also indicative of increased arterial stiffness (2). While the overall pattern of
462 change with spaceflight was increased arterial stiffness, there were interesting sex differences with
463 women showing greater changes in carotid artery B-stiffness index, yet men had greater changes in
464 pulse wave transit time. It is not clear whether this is simply a consequence of the relatively small
465 sample sizes, or if there are real variations as a consequence of regional and sex differences.
466 An increase in insulin resistance was determined from the fasting blood glucose and insulin
467 concentrations measured in space as hypothesized. To the extent that the measured blood biomarker
468 changes had an influence on vascular structure or function with spaceflight, women had less increase in
469 the HOMA-IR and a trend to increased SOD which might positively benefit arterial responses, while

16

"
"17","470 having less increase in IGF-1 and greater increases in renin and aldosterone which might negatively
471 affect arterial stiffness. Both men and women had reductions in MMP-Z which might reflect less repair
472 of vascular wall extracellular matrix.
473 The complex interactions between factors make it difficult to identify specific cause-effect relationships
474 in this small sample of male and female astronauts. Continuing research with the NASA supported
475 projects ”Cardio Ox” and ”Fluid Shifts”, and the Canadian Space Agency project ”Vascular Echo” might
476 be able to resolve some of the mechanisms underlying cardiovascular adaptations to spaceflight and to
477 follow post-flight recovery.

700 Figure 1. Carotid distensibility coefficient (CDC using brachial pulse pressure for comparison to
701 population data) is shown for the astronauts (left) and a reference population (right). For astronauts
702 pre-flight symbols (women = circles, men = triangles) are connected to that individual’s post-flight (star)
703 with main effect statistics shown for repeated measures 2-way ANOVA. The reference population was
704 published from the Multi-Ethnic Study on Atherosclerosis (10) where lines connecting a 10 year interval
705 represent longitudinal collections of four groups collected in cross-sectional data (mean i 1 SD, total
706 n=1039).
707
708 Figure 2. Individual values for pulse wave transit time measured: (A) from the R-wave to the foot of the
709 finger BP pulse detected as the peak of the second derivative and (B) from the R-wave to the foot of the
710 BP pulse at the posterior tibial artery in the ankle. Pre-flight and post-flight values are shown for men
711 (triangles, solid lines) and women (circles, dotted lines). Analysis by two-way repeated measures ANOVA
712 for main effects and interactions are shown.

714 Figure 3. Individual data showing pre-flight to inflight for metabolic biomarkers related to glucose
715 metabolism (women: circles, dashed lines; men: triangles, solid lines). Mean values 1r SD are shown with
716 open circles and error bar lines. P-values are from 2-way repeated measures ANOVA for the main effects
717 of Flight and Sex and their interaction are displayed, see also Table 3.
