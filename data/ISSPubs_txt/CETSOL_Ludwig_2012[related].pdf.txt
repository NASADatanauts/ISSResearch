Investigations on solidifying transparent model alloys have served frequently
to gain knowledge on physical phenomena occurring during solidiﬁcation of
metallic alloys. However, quantitative results were obtainable in thin samples
where convection can successfully be suppressed. Quantitative studies on
three-dimensional phenomena not being affected by natural convection are
thus only possible under microgravity conditions. Therefore, the European
Space Agency (ESA) is planning to launch a new insert for the material sci—
ence glovebox on board of the International Space Station for studies on
solidiﬁcation phenomena in thick samples. Four different classes of trans—
parent model alloys will be used to address the following scientiﬁc topics: (I)
columnar t0 equiaxed transition in solidiﬁcation processing, (11) novel peri—
tectic structures and in situ composites; (III) solidiﬁcation along an eutectic
path in binary alloys; and (IV) solidiﬁcation along an eutectic path in ternary
alloys. In this article, we give details on the scientiﬁc objectives and the
operational features ESA’s new solidiﬁcation device will offer.
