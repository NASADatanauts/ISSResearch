ABSTRACT
The meehanism(s) for post bed rest orthostatic intolerance is equivocal. The

vestibulosympathetie reﬂex contributes to postural blood pressure regulation. It was
hypothesized that muscle sympathetic nerve responses to otolith stimulation would be attenuated
by prolonged head-down bed rest (BR). Arterial blood pressure, heart rate, muscle sympathetic
nerve activity (MSNA), and peripheral vascular conductance were measured during head-down
rotation (HDR; otolith organ stimulation) in the prone posture before and after short-duration
(24-hrs; 11:22) and prolonged (36i1 days; 11:8) BR. Head-up tilt at 800 was performed to assess
orthostatic tolerance. After short-duration BR, MSNA responses to HDR were preserved (ASil
bursts/rnin, A53i13 % burst frequency, A65i13% total activity; p<0.001). After prolonged BR,
MSNA responses to HDR were attenuated ~5 0%. MSNA increased by A8i2 vs. A3i2 bursts/min
and A83i12 vs. A34i22% total activity during HDR before and after prolonged bed rest,
respectively. Moreover, these results were observed in 3 subj eets tested again after 75i1 days of
BR. This reduction in MSNA responses to otolith organ stimulation at 5 wk occurred with
reductions in head-up tilt duration. These results indicate that prolonged BR (~5 wk) unlike
short-term BR (24 h) attenuates the vestibulosympathetic reﬂex and possibly contributes to
orthostatic intolerance following BR in humans. These results suggest a novel mechanism in the
development of orthostatic intolerance in humans.

INTRODUCTION

Orthostatic intolerance (01) is the inability to maintain blood pressure and cerebral
perfusion While in the upright position. Moreover, the failure to maintain blood pressure in the
upright posture is associated With increased mortality (26). Head-down bed rest (BR) is used to
simulate microgravity, physical deeonditioning, and to elicit 01 (13). Mechanisms believed to
contribute to the development 0f 01 With BR include: impaired vagal baroreﬂeX responses (5),
an inadequate increase in sympathetic discharge (18, 42), cardiac atrophy (24), an inability to
increase peripheral vascular resistance (3, 25), and hypovolemia (29). Studies indicate that
alterations in sympathetic nerve activity contribute to the development 0f 01 (13, 18, 25, 42).
Hypotensive episodes during head-up tilt appear to be closely related to lack of increased MSNA
(25). MSNA is attenuated during tilt following 14 days of BR in subj eets that experienced 01
(42). Despite considerable research on this topic, the mechanisms for 01 have been an enigma.
One possible mechanism for the development 0f 01 after bed rest that has not been examined is
an alteration of the vestibulosympathetic reﬂex (VSR).

Data eXist demonstrating the presence of a vestibular-mediated sympathetic reﬂex that
contributes to blood pressure regulation in both humans and animals (8, 15, 19, 43, 49, 50).
Bilateral transection 0f the vestibular nerve results in persistent hypotension during upright tilt in
the cat (8). Additionally, direct electrical stimulation of the vestibular nerve elicits sympathetic
nerve activation and increased vascular resistance in the cat (21, 22, 48, 50). In humans, using
head-down rotation (HDR) as a model to activate the vestibular otolith organs, we have
demonstrated marked increases in MSNA and peripheral vasoconstriction (15, 31, 33-35, 43).
Other studies have supported the presence of the VSR in humans (1, 12, 19, 46). Studies
examining changes to the vestibular system after bed rest are sparse. Altered nystagmus patterns

"

indicating changes in vestibular function have been observed after seven days of BR (4).
However, currently no studies have examined if the VSR is altered after BR.

The purpose of this study was to examine the vestibulosympathetio reﬂex and 01 after
short—duration and prolonged 6O head-down BR. It was hypothesized that the MSNA response to
HDR would be attenuated after prolonged BR and would be associated with reductions in
orthostatio tolerance. Additionally, there would be no relation between the VSR and orthostatio
tolerance after short-term BR because the lack of adequate time to elicit functional changes in
the vestibular system.

METHODS

The Institutional Review Board of the Pennsylvania State University College of Medicine
and the University of Texas Medical Branch in Galveston, TX (Study 2), approved all
experiments and written informed consent was obtained from all subj eots before testing.
Experimental Design

Two studies were performed. One study consisted of 24-h BR conducted at the General
Clinical Research Center at the Milton S. Hershey Medical Center in Hershey, PA. The second
study consisted of prolonged BR (3 6i1 days) and was conducted in association with the
University of Texas Medical Branch Flight Analogs Research Center, in Galveston, TX. All
experiments were performed in a dimly lit, quiet laboratory maintained at 21-23 C’C.

Head—down Rotation (HDR)

Both studies used vestibular otolith activation before and after BR. Subj ects performed
HDR in the prone position to engage the otolith organs as previously described (43). This
maneuver, however, does not engage the semicircular canals when the head becomes stationary.
Previous studies have eliminated other possible factors (such as neck afferents, baroreceptors,
central command, and Visual inputs) contributing to sympathetic activation during HDR (15, 30,
31, 33, 43). After a 3-min baseline period with the head in the chin-up neck extended position,
the chin support was removed and the head was passively rotated to the point of maximal
rotation. This position was maintained for 3 min followed by the subj ect’s head being passively
returned to the chin-up neck—extended position for 3 min of recovery. During the head
movements, continuous blood pressure measurements, heart rate, MSNA, and limb blood ﬂow of
the contralateral leg were recorded.

Head—up Tilt (HUT)

A11 subj ects underwent a head-up tilt (HUT) test at 800 for up to 30 min to assess their
orthostatic tolerance before and after BR. HUT was performed during pretesting, after 24-h BR,
and either at 45 days (n=3) or 60 days (11:4) 0f BR. The tilt test was terminated for any of the
following reasons: if the subject completed 30 min of head-up tilt, the subj ects began to feel
presyncopal symptoms including lightheadedness, nausea, vomiting, excessive heat, or sweating,
the subjects” systolic blood pressure decreased >25 mmHg or below 70 mmHg, or diastolic
blood pressure decreased >15 mmHg. Arterial blood pressure and heart rate were monitored
continuously during HUT.

24-Hour Bed Rest

Twenty-two young healthy volunteers (12 men and 10 women; age: 24i1 years; height:
174.4i2.6 em; weight: 71.7i3.4 kg) participated in the study. All subjects were non-smokers,
non-obese, normotensive, and not taking any medications that would inﬂuence the results of the
study.

Subj eets abstained from caffeine (12 h) before and during the study. Subj eets performed
HDR and HUT as described above. Following the HUT protocol, the instrumentation was
removed and subj eets were placed at 60 head-down BR for 24 h. During this time, subj eets were
not allowed to sit-up or get out of bed. Their sleep schedule was maintained to what they
received the night before testing. After 24 h, the subj eets were brought back into the testing room
to undergo the same experimental protocol as before BR. During posttesting, the subj eets did not
sit-up or get out of BR during this time, but were brought back up to the zero-degree level and
instrumented for the HDR protocol.
Prolonged Bed Rest

Eight healthy volunteers (5 men and 3 women; age: 26 — 44 y; height: 155.2 — 170.9 cm;
weight: 43.8 — 90.8 kg) participated in the study. A suitable nerve signal could not be obtained in
one subj eet and was excluded from the MSNA analysis. Popliteal blood ﬂow data was not
successfully obtained in a different subj ect and was excluded from blood ﬂow analysis. All
subj eets were nonsmokers, in good health with 110 history of cardiovascular, neurological,
gastrointestinal, 0r museuloskeletal problems.

This study was part of a 115-119 day BR study conducted at the University of Texas
Medical Branch Flight Analogs Research Center in Galveston, Texas, sponsored by NASA. The

"
"7","7
subj eets were tested approximately 6i1 days before BR and underwent HDR protocol and HUT
as described in the 24-h BR study. After the pretest period, the subj eets were placed in 60 head-
down BR for 90 days. Participants lived in a special research unit for the entire study and were
fed a carefully controlled diet. Every day, they were awake for 16 h and lights out (asleep) for 8
h. During the bed rest time, they participated in a number of other tests run by a variety of
researchers. Subj eets repeated the HDR protocol at 36i1 days of BR. Three subjects repeated the
protocol again at 75i1 days of BR. In addition, the subj eets performed HUT at 45 days (11:3) or
60 days (11:4) 0f BR.

Measurements

Mieroneurography was used to assess MSNA as previously described (43). Brieﬂy,
multiﬁber recordings of MSNA were obtained from a tungsten microelectrode inserted in the
peroneal nerve behind the knee. A reference electrode was placed subcutaneously 2-3 cm from
the recording electrode. Previously identiﬁed criteria for an adequate MSNA signal were applied
to ensure proper recording (44). The nerve signal was amplified (20,000 — 40,000 times), fed
though a bandpass ﬁlter with a band width of 700-2,000 Hz, integrated using a 0.1 s time
constant (University of Iowa Bioengineering, Iowa City, IA), and recorded digitally (16SP
Powerlab, ADInstruments, New Castle, Australia). The mean voltage neurogram was routed to a
computer screen and a loudspeaker for monitoring during the study. Sympathetic recordings that
demonstrated possible electrode site shifts, altered respiratory patterns (e.g., breath holding,
inspiratory gasp, and hyperventilation), 0r electromyographic artifact during experimental
intervention were excluded from analysis.

Leg blood ﬂow was assessed in two ways. Venous occlusion plethysmography
(Hokanson EC 4 plethysmograph, D.E. Hokanson, Bellevue, WA) was used to assess calf blood
ﬂow of the contralateral leg (24 h BR), as previously described (15) and Doppler ultrasound
(Phillips Medical Systems, iU22, with a 5-12 MHz linear probe) was used to assess popliteal
blood ﬂow (Prolonged BR). Calf vascular conductance was calculated as the ratio of limb blood
ﬂow to mean arterial pressure. Popliteal blood ﬂow was determined by mean blood velocity and
diameter of the vessel. Leg vascular conductance was calculated as the ratio of popliteal blood
ﬂow to mean arterial pressure.

Heart rate was derived from an electrocardiogram. Arterial blood pressure was measured
continuously by a ﬁnger photoplethysmography (Finapres, Ohmeda, Englewood, CO) during
each trial. Respiration pattern was monitored using impedance plethysmography.

Data Analysis

All data were digitally recorded at 100 Hz for later off line analysis. MSNA was
expressed as bursts per minute and total activity (sum of the area of each individual bursts
expressed in arbitrary units). Neurograrns were normalized using the highest burst amplitude set
to 1000 and the baseline set to zero. Sympathetic bursts were identiﬁed from the mean voltage
neurogram by Visual inspection with a computer program (Chart 5, ADInstruments).

Statistics

To identify possible differences within each bed rest trial, a two-way (BR, intervention)
repeated-measures analysis of variance (ANOVA) was used. Tests for simple effects were used
to identify differences in baseline (20). MSNA responses to HDR were made between the

"
"9","9
average resting (baseline) value and the ﬁrst minute of HDR. Data from 3 subj eets at day 75 was
not used in the statistical analysis. A significance level of p<0.05 was used for all tests. Values
are presented as mean i SEM.

RESULTS

24-Hour Bed Rest

The effect of 24-h BR 011 MSNA responses the t0 VSR activation is shown in Figure 1.
Before BR, MSNA signiﬁcantly increased during HDR in both burst frequency (9i1 t0 14i2
bursts/min, ASil bursts/min; p<0.001; 11:22) and total activity (A83i19%; p<0.001). After BR,
MSNA at rest signiﬁcantly increased (14i2 bursts/min; p<0.001). Despite elevated baseline
MSNA at rest, HDR signiﬁcantly increased MSNA in both burst frequency (19i2 bursts/min,
ASil bursts/min; p<0.001) and total activity (A65i18% total activity; p<0.002). Thus, there were
no signiﬁcant differences in the MSNA response to HDR before and after 24-h BR (Fig. 1).
Individual MSNA responses to HDR are presented in the left panel of Figure 2. Mean arterial
pressure and heart rate did not change significantly with HDR and were not signiﬁcantly
different before and after BR (Table 1). Venous occlusion plethysmography was used to measure
calf blood ﬂow in eight subj eets and the results are presented in Figure 3. Calf vascular
conductance decreased both before and after BR (A 15i9 and A 22i5%, respectively; p<0.05)
during HDR. There was no signiﬁcant difference in calf vascular conductance before and after
BR (Fig. 3).

HUT duration before and after BR is shown in Figure 4 (left panel). Thirteen subj eets
decreased, four subj eets increased, and five subj eets had no change in tilt time after BR. We

"

observed no relation between VSR activation and altered orthostatic intolerance before and after
24-h BR.

Prolonged BR

Figure 5 is a representative neurogram 0f the MSNA response to HDR before and after
prolonged BR in one subj ect. Before BR, MSNA signiﬁcantly increased in both burst frequency
(13i3 t0 21i4 burst/min, A8i2 bursts/min; p<0.05; 11:7) and total activity (A83i12%; p<0.01)
during HDR (Fig. 6). At 36i1 days of BR, the baseline MSNA at rest was increased from 13i3
t0 22i4 bursts/min (p<0.05). Unlike 24-h BR, prolonged BR attenuated the MSNA responses to
HDR. MSNA was not significantly increased with HDR in either burst frequency (A3i2
bursts/min, A23i13%) or total activity (A34i22%) after prolonged BR (Fig. 6). Individual
MSNA responses are presented in Figure 2 (right panel). Six subj eets had an attenuated MSNA
response to HDR after BR whereas one subj eet demonstrated no change in MSNA response to
HDR. Additionally, three subj eets were tested again at 75i1 days of BR. Baseline MSNA at
rest increased further from 22i4 bursts/min at day 36 t0 29i8 bursts/min at day 75. The increase
in MSNA t0 HDR remained attenuated in these subj eets (A23i13% bursts/min). Before BR,
mean arterial pressure and heart rate did not significantly change during HDR (Table 1).
Following prolonged BR, mean arterial pressure at rest decreased from 101i4 t0 94i5 mmHg
(p<0.001), but did not signiﬁcantly change during HDR. Baseline heart rate increased (68i5 t0
73i4 beats/min; p<0.01) and was signiﬁcantly increased with HDR(A5i1 beats/min, Table 1)
after BR. Before BR, Doppler ultrasound of the popliteal artery demonstrated a tendency to
decrease popliteal blood ﬂow (117i32 t0 101i27 mL/min; p=0.07) and popliteal vascular
conductance (A13i5%; p=0.09) during HDR (Fig. 7). At 36i1 days of BR, baseline popliteal

"
"11","1 1
blood ﬂow at rest tended to be decreased (100i17 mL/min; p=0.06). However, popliteal blood
ﬂow and vascular conductance did not significantly decrease during HDR (Fig. 7).

HUT duration before and after BR is shown for individual subj eets in Figure 4 (right
panel). Six subjects decreased, whereas one subject had no change in tilt time after BR.

DISCUSSION

The major ﬁnding from this study was that prolonged BR attenuated the VSR. These
results suggest a desensitization of the VSR occurs after prolonged bed rest deeonditioning. This
physiological adaptation may serve as a contributory mechanism for the development 0f 01 after
physical deeonditioning and spaceﬂight.

Subj eets performed HUT to assess orthostatie tolerance. After the 24-h BR, some of the
subj eets decreased tilt time, whereas other subj eets demonstrated an increase or no change in tilt
time. There was 110 clear relation between the change in tilt time and the sensitivity of the VSR
after 24-h BR in our subj eets. However, during prolonged BR nearly all subj eets had a reduction
in tilt time and an attenuated VSR. Additionally, the VSR remained attenuated in three subj eets
tested again at 75i1 days of BR. These results could suggest that over time during BR, the VSR
might be a contributing factor in the development of orthostatie hypotension.

The increase in MSNA during HDR before BR is consistent with our previous findings
(15 , 32, 43). Despite the increased baseline MSNA at rest after 24-h BR, HDR increased MSNA
t0 the same extent as before BR indicating an intact VSR. In contrast, after prolonged BR the
increase in MSNA t0 HDR was signiﬁcantly attenuated. This observation suggests a clear
reduction in the sensitivity of the VSR. The meehanism(s) by which these changes occur is
unknown. However, a possible mechanism to explain the change in the VSR with BR could be

"
"12","12
due to changes in the sensitivity of the vestibular apparatus through a possible ﬂuid shift in the
inner ear. Recently, our lab has demonstrated that dehydration by glycerol attenuates the VSR
(10). A similar ﬂuid shift elicited by hypovolemia experienced during BR might contribute to the
attenuated VSR during prolonged BR. Additionally, desensitization of the VSR could occur With
prolonged BR through structural hair cell changes, Which has been reported to occur With aging
(2, 11, 37) and microgravity (6). We have reported that older subj eets have marked attenuation in
the VSR (36) and experience an increase in orthostatie intolerance (40). Thus, structural changes
of the VSR could be a common mechanism explaining increased 01 observed With bed rest
deconditioning and With aging. Other explanations could include altered integration between the
baroreﬂexes and the VSR (9, 14, 31), changes in the central processing of vestibular inputs (16,
49), or possible alterations in the excitability of the various neural pathways that regulate
sympathetic activity.

Some studies have suggested a correlation between 01 and changes in vestibular function
after spaceﬂight (36, 47, 49). Kamiya et a1. (18) demonstrated a paradoxical sympathetic
Withdrawal With less of an increase in MSNA during upright tilt in subj eets that experience 01
after 14 days BR. An altered VSR could explain the attenuated increase in MSNA observed in
their study. Mierogravity has been demonstrated to elicit marked changes in the vestibular
system With at least 50% of astronauts experiencing space motion sickness in the ﬁrst few days
(7) and altered otolith-ocular and otolith-spinal reﬂexes (27). Both morphological and
physiological changes to the vestibular system have been demonstrated after spaceﬂight (6, 28,
38, 39, 45). Most changes to the vestibular system as a result of microgravity impact the otolith
organs because they are dependent on gravitational inputs (7, 27, 49). Because the VSR is an
otolith-mediated reﬂex (19, 35), it is reasonable to hypothesize that the changes observed during

"
"13","13
BR could apply to microgravity and contribute to post-spaeeﬂight 01 which occurs in nearly
two-thirds of all astronauts (3).

A secondary observation from this study is that baseline MSNA at rest was elevated
rapidly by one day of BR (Study 1). Previous studies investigating baseline MSNA at rest after
BR have revealed equivocal results. Both increases (17, 29) and decreases (41) in baseline
MSNA at rest have been reported. Our results indicate an increase in baseline MSNA after both
24-h and prolonged BR similar to previous reports (17). Elevated MSNA at rest has also been
reported in spaceﬂight (23). These results are consistent with the concept that MSNA at rest
should increase as a result of reduced cardiac ﬁlling pressures and central blood volume that is
associated with prolonged BR (13, 24).

It could be suggested that the elevated MSNA at rest after prolonged BR prevented a
further increase in MSNA during HDR. However, indicators suggest otherwise. First, all subj eets
demonstrated a robust sympathetic response to apnea following BR (data not presented). This
indicates that sympathetic activity could go higher than what was observed during HDR after
prolonged bed rest and was not limited by the elevation in MSNA at rest. Second, in three
subj eets where MSNA measurements were taken at both day 36 and day 75 of bed rest there was
a clear elevation in MSNA at rest (from ~22 to 29 bursts/min, respectively). However, despite
this further increase in MSNA at rest, MSNA responses to HDR were still comparable. If the
elevated baseline MSNA contributed in limiting the sympathetic responses to HDR, MSNA
would have been expected to increase less at day 75. However, this was not the case.

Changes in peripheral vascular conductance observed in these studies correspond with
changes in MSNA. Other studies have noted reduced peripheral vascular responses after BR (13,
18). In our study, elevated sympathetic activation at rest could affect the sensitivity and

"
"14","14
responsiveness of the vasculature. However, this does not appear to be the case after short-
duration BR because HDR elicited comparable increases in MSNA with corresponding
reductions in calf vascular conductance despite elevated MSNA. In contrast, after prolonged BR
the sensitivity of the vasculature could be altered. Our data demonstrates a relation between
diminished MSNA and vasculature responses to HDR following prolonged BR. Therefore an
attenuation of the VSR could contribute to inadequate increases in limb vasoconstriction and
contribute to subsequent decreases in orthostatie tolerance.

HDR protocols and HUT were not performed 011 the same day during the prolonged BR
study. We do not believe this limitation adversely affects our interpretation of the results because
the data were reproducible at 75 days in three of the subj eets. Additionally, it is difﬁcult to
quantify the stimulus to the otolith organs that HDR elicits. However, to minimize this concern,
repeated HDR maneuvers were performed to the same degree of head rotation within subj eets.
Therefore, we believe we elicited comparable stimulation of the VSR before and after BR.
Finally, it is recognized that a time control group was not a part of this study. The original plan
of this proj eet was to retest the subj eets after they were again mobile and rehabilitated. However,
Hurricane Rita caused a premature stoppage of this proj eet and prevented us from retesting these
subj eets.

Summary

This study demonstrates that prolonged bed rest (~ 5 wk) unlike short-term bed rest (24
h) attenuates the VSR. This attenuation in the VSR was associated with reduced orthostatic
tolerance. These results could suggest a novel mechanism that might contribute to the
development 0f 01.

Figure Legend

Figure 1. MSNA burst frequency (bursts/min) and change in total activity (%) during HDR
before and after 24-hr BR. Burst frequency signiﬁcantly increased during HDR
both before and after BR. Baseline MSNA was signiﬁcantly increased following
BR. The change in total activity was significantly increased during HDR, but was
not signiﬁcantly different from before BR. * P<0.001 compared to baseline, T
P<0.01 compared to before BR, NS (not signiﬁcant).

Figure 2. Individual responses for change in MSNA (total activity) during HDR following
24-h and 36-day BR. Fifteen subj ects decreased and seven subj ects increased their
change in MSNA (total activity) during HDR after 24-h BR. Also, six subj ects
decreased and one subj ect had no change in MSNA (total activity) during HDR
following prolonged BR.

Figure 3. Change in calf blood ﬂow (%) and calf vascular conductance (%, blood
ﬂow/MAP) during HDR before and after 24-hrs 0f BR. Both blood ﬂow and calf
vascular conductance signiﬁcantly decreased during HDR both before and after
BR (P<0.05). Flow and conductance were not signiﬁcantly different after BR. NS
(not signiﬁcant).

Figure 4. Individual responses for head-up tilt duration after 24-h and prolonged BR.
Thirteen subj ects decreased, four subj ects increased, and five subjects had no
change in tilt time from before to after 24-h BR. Six subj ects decreased, while
only one subj ect had no change in tilt time from before to after 36-days BR.

Figure 5. Representative neurogram of one test subj ect before and after 36 days of BR.
Baseline MSNA at rest was increased after BR. MSNA increased signiﬁcantly
during HDR before BR, but at 36 days, the increase in MSNA was attenuated.

Figure 6. MSNA burst frequency (bursts/min) and change in total activity (%) during HDR
before and after prolonged BR. MSNA signiﬁcantly increased during HDR before
BR. Baseline MSNA was signiﬁcantly increased after BR. MSNA was not
signiﬁcantly increased during HDR at 36i1 days. * P<0.05 compared to baseline.
T P<0.05 compared to before BR.

Figure 7. Change in popliteal blood ﬂow and leg vascular conductance (%, blood
ﬂow/MAP) during HDR before and after prolonged BR. Blood ﬂow and vascular
conductance tended to decrease before bed rest (p=0.07, p=0.09, respectively).
