Sensor design and mission planning for satellite ocean color measurements requires careful consid-
eration of the signal dynamic range and sensitivity (speciﬁcally here signal-to-noise ratio or SNR) so
that small changes of ocean properties (e.g., surface chlorophyll-a concentrations or Chl) can be quan-
tiﬁed while most measurements are not saturated. Past and current sensors used different signal
levels, formats, and conventions to specify these critical parameters, making it difﬁcult to make
cross-sensor comparisons or to establish standards for future sensor design. The goal of this study is
to quantify these parameters under uniform conditions for widely used past and current sensors in
order to provide a reference for the design of future ocean color radiometers. Using measurements
from the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer onboard the Aqua satellite (MODISA) un-
der various solar zenith angles (SZAs), typical (Ltypical) and maximum (Lmax) at-sensor radiances from
the Visible to the shortwave IR were determined. The Ltypical values at an SZA of 45° were used as
constraints to calculate SNRs 0f 10 multiband sensors at the same Ltypical radiance input and 2 hy-
perspectral sensors at a similar radiance input. The calculations were based on clear—water scenes
with an objective method of selecting pixels with minimal cross-pixel variations to assure target homo-
geneity. Among the widely used ocean color sensors that have routine global coverage, MODISA ocean
bands (1 km) showed 2—4 times higher SNRs than the Sea-Viewing Wide Field-of-View Sensor (Sea-
WiFS) (1 km) and comparable SNRs to the Medium Resolution Imaging Spectrometer (MERIS)-RR
(reduced resolution, 1.2 km), leading to different levels of precision in the retrieved Chl data product.
MERIS-FR (full resolution, 300 m) showed SNRs lower than MODISA and MERIS-RR with the gain
in spatial resolution. SNRs of all MODISA ocean bands and SeaWiFS bands (except the SeaWiFS
near—IR bands) exceeded those from prelaunch sensor speciﬁcations after adjusting the input radiance
to Ltypical. The tabulated Ltypical, Lmax, and SNRs 0f the various multiband and hyperspectral sensors
under the same or similar radiance input provide references to compare sensor performance in pro-
duct precision and to help design future missions such as the Geostationary Coastal and Air Pollution
Events (GEO-CAPE) mission and the Pre-Aerosol-Clouds-Ecosystems (PACE) mission currently being
planned by the US. National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA). © 2012 Optical Society

“The last column lists NASA speciﬁcations [9]. The mean and STD values for SZA = 45° in columns seven and eight were used as the
typical radiance to determine sensor SNR (i.e._, sensitivity) for 10 heritage instruments.
1’The NASA prelaunch MODIS speciﬁcations were provided by Xiong et al. [9]. For SeaWiFS, the input radiances for SNR speciﬁcations
were [9.10, 8.41, 6.56, 5.64, 4.57, 2.46, 1.61, 1.09] for the eight spectral bands at [412, 443, 490, 510, 555, 670, 765, 865 nm] (see [2,ﬂl).
°These bands were designed for land and atmospheric applications, but they could also be used to study the ocean.
