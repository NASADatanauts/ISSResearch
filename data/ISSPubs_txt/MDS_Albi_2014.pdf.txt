Abstract
During space missions, astronauts work in a state of separation from their daily social environment and in
physical conﬁnement. It has been shown that conﬁnement inﬂuences mood and brain cortical activity, but no
data has been obtained with regard to its effect on the thyroid gland, the structure and function of which change
during spaceﬂights. Here, we report the results of a study on the effects of conﬁnement on mouse thyroid, which
was implemented with the Mice Drawer System Facility maintained on the ground, a system used for space—
ﬂight experiments. The results show that conﬁnement changes the microscopic structure of the thyroid gland
and that it eXhibits symptoms similar to those that result from physiological and/or pathological hyperfunction.
What is left unchanged, however, is the sphingomyelinase—thyr0tr0pin receptor relationship, which is important
for thyrotropin response with a consequential production of hormones that act on the metabolism of almost all
tissues and reduces the production of calcitonin, a hormone involved in bone metabolism. During space
missions, the overexpression of pleiotrophin, a widespread cytokine up—regulated after tissue injury that acts on
bone remodeling, attenuates changes to the thyroid that are spaceﬂight—dependent; therefore we studied the
thyroids 0f pleiotrophin—transgenic mice in the Mice Drawer System Facility. In conﬁnement, pleiotrophin
overexpression does not protect from the loss of calcitonin. The contribution of conﬁnement t0 thyroid damage
during spaceﬂights is discussed. Key Words: Calcitonin—Conﬁnement—Sphingomyelinase—Thyroid—
