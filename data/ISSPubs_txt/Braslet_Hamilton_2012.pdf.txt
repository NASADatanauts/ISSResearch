77 Abstract
78
79 Background: The transition to microgravity eliminates the hydrostatic gradients in the vascular
80 system. The resulting ﬂuid redistribution commonly manifests as facial edema, engorgement 0f
81 the external neck veins, nasal congestion, and headache. This experiment examined the
82 responses to modiﬁed Valsalva and Mueller maneuvers measured by cardiac and vascular
83 ultrasound (ECHO) in a baseline steady state and under the inﬂuence of thigh occlusion cuffs
84 available as a countermeasure device (Braslet cuffs).
85 Methods: Nine International Space Station crewmember subj eets (Expeditions 16 - 20) were
86 examined in 15 experiment sessions 101i46 days after launch (mean i SD; 33 - 185). 27 cardiac
87 and vascular parameters were obtained with/without respiratory maneuvers before and after
88 tightening of the Braslet cuffs (162 data points/session). Quality of cardiac and vascular
89 ultrasound examinations was assured through remote monitoring and guidance by Investigators
90 from the NASA Telescience Center in Houston, TX, USA and the Mission Control Center in
91 Korolyov, Moscow region, Russia.
92 Results: Three of 27 parameters were found to respond differently to respiratory maneuvers
93 depending on the presence or absence of thigh compression (11 0f 81 differences were
94 signiﬁcant and apparently related to cardiac preload reduction or increase in the venous volume
95 sequestered in the lower extremity.
96 Conclusions: Acute application of Braslet occlusion cuffs causes lower extremity ﬂuid
97 sequestration and exerts commensurate measurable effects on cardiac performance in
98 microgravity. Ultrasound techniques to measure the hemodynamic effects of thigh cuffs in
99 combination with respiratory maneuvers may serve as an effective tool in determining the
100 volume status of a cardiac or hemodynamically compromised patient at the “microgravity
101 bedside”.

105 Introduction
106
107 An immediate effect of the transition to microgravity during early spaceﬂight is a10ss of
108 the hydrostatic gradient in the cardiovascular system, resulting in a eephalad venous and
109 lymphatic ﬂuid shift.(11; 15) The loss of lower extremity volume is in the order of 1- 21, (11;
110 50) i.e. larger than upon transition to supine or even head-down-tilt (HDT) posture 0n Earth.(4;
111 6; 8; 51) Notwithstanding the massive ﬂuid shift, invasive CVP measurements in spaceﬂight
112 have shown it to decrease to 2 mmHg and no clinically signiﬁcant long-term changes in cardiac
113 0utput.(12; 13) Increased jugular venous distension in space ﬂight is seen consistently and
114 persists throughout the mission, (30) but it is no longer a reliable index of right atrial pressure or
115 right ventricular preload.
116 The effect of ﬂuid redistribution in astronauts is commonly observed as Visible facial
117 edema (“pufﬁness”) and engorgement 0f the external neck veins, With a concomitant decrease in
118 leg size. Subj ectively, erewmembers report “fullness in the head,” nasal congestion, and
119 diminished sense of taste and sme11.(41)
120 Research proj ects involving eehocardiography have been conducted on almost every
121 space vehicle since 1980.(6; 9; 20; 23; 30; 36; 42-45)
122 Occlusive inﬂatable cuffs and the Braslet have been investigated in an attempt to reverse
123 the ﬂuid shifts seen during HDT and mierogravity.(4; 5; 7) Investigations have documented the
124 peripheral vascular effects, however ultrasound technology at the time was not adequate to
125 conﬁrm the effect on cardiac preload.(3 0) The International Space Station (188) Ultrasound
126 System operated With real-time remote guidance has heightened both the scope and the ﬁdelity
127 of imaging studies in space; (16; 18; 19; 30; 46; 47) furthermore, the ISS crew represents an
128 unprecedented cohort of long-duration microgravity test subj eets for prospective investigations.
129 In a recent ISS-based study, Hamilton et a1(30) presented a set of standardized methods and
130 eehocardiographie “normal” results in siX subj eets during long duration spaceﬂight.
131 The Braslet-M thigh cuff countermeasure device is intended to ameliorate the symptoms
132 associated With the microgravity-induced eephalad volume shifts in the early hours and days of
133 microgravity exposure by impeding the venous outﬂow and creating commensurate ﬂuid
134 sequestration in the lower extremities. The cuffs are custom built for each crewmember before

"
"5","5
135 the mission and consist of segments of elastic and non-elastie materials to conform to the shape
136 of the upper thigh. (Figure 1) Each device contains an adjustment belt Which can be tightened to
137 achieve the desired degree of compression selected in preﬂight calibration - a special -30 -
138 degree tilt—table procedure based on subj eet feedback and cranial impedance rheography to
139 determine the appropriate compression of the extremity.
140 Purpose
141
142 The purpose of this study is to determine if the Braslet consistently changes the responses
143 of the cardiovascular system to the Valsalva and Mueller maneuvers, and Whether combinations
144 of Braslet and maneuvers, in comparison With the maneuvers alone, have utility for the
145 assessment of the ﬂuid status in microgravity.
146 The increased intrathoraeie pressure during Valsalva maneuver (Valsalva) causes
147 signiﬁcant changes in the cardiovascular and cerebrovascular circulation.(3 9) The “classic”
148 Valsalva has four distinct phases: onset of strain, continued strain, release, and recovery.(21) In
149 microgravity and during HDT the internal jugular vein (UV) is distended constantly, (31; 48)
150 allowing for only small, if any, added expansion upon Valsalva .(31) The Braslet occlusion
151 thigh cuff is expected to sequester ﬂuid in the lower extremities and potentially reduce cardiac
152 preload; this may result in a change to the effect of the Valsalva 011 both cardiac preload and UV
153 distention. The Mueller maneuver (Mueller) consists of inspiration With closed mouth and nose
154 (or closed glottis) performed after a forced expiration; it causes reduction of intrathoraeie
155 pressure, Which is the opposite of the Valsalva. In microgravity the UV showed a trend to
156 diminish in size When Mueller was performed.(31) The expected effect of Braslet in reducing
157 preload may desaturate the UV distention, enhancing the effect of the Mueller 0n the UV, and
158 making Mueller With optional Braslet application a clinically relevant tool for ﬂuid status
159 assessment in microgravity.
160 The current investigation is a collaborative effort between the NASA and the Federal
161 Space Agency of Russia/Roscosmos investigators to observe the hemodynamic effects of the
162 Braslet-M device in nominal steady-state condition, as well as during Mueller and Valsalva
163 respiratory maneuvers performed before and during its application.

164 Hypothesis
165
166 The Braslet-M device, when used per the current calibration and application procedures, will:
167 0 consistently cause ﬂuid sequestration and reduce ﬂow velocities in the venous
168 vascular bed of lower extremities in microgravity, acutely reducing the circulating
169 volume;
170 0 reduce cardiac preload in microgravity for the duration of application;
171 0 facilitate the effects of the Valsalva and Mueller maneuvers 0n the ﬁlling
172 (distention) and behavior of internal jugular vein observed by real-time
173 sonography.
174 Methods
175 Subject Selection
176 A11 erewmembers were medically certified for space ﬂight by the ISS Multilateral Space
177 Medicine Board using a physical examination and screening that includes a comprehensive
178 cardiovascular assessment with ECG, exercise stress test, transthoraeic eehoeardiography, Holter
179 monitoring, Electron Beam CT for coronary calcium scoring, a large assortment of laboratory
180 tests, and a clinical cardiovascular risk assessment. Subj eets and operators for this study were
181 enlisted 011 a voluntary basis following informed consent. The study was approved by the human
182 research boards of each subject’s agency, and then by the 188 Human Research Multilateral
183 Review Board.
184 Braslet Calibration
185 Braslet-M sets were custom made by the manufacturer (Kentavr-Nauka, Ltd., Moscow,
186 Russia) for each subj eet and then individually calibrated as a nominal operational
187 countermeasure in a standardized preﬂight tilt-table procedure. Cranial rheographic data were
188 acquired in supine and -30 degree HDT. The Braslet was gradually tightened in a stepwise
189 fashion while trained experts recorded subj ective feedback, rheographic tracing, and the
190 appearance of the subj ect. The device setting was determined to assure subj ective improvement
191 (reduction of fullness of the head and nasal congestion, and often a perception of being un-
192 tilted), as well as return of rheographic tracing t0 the pre-tilt pattern. (Figure I) This setting is

"
"7","7
193 considered to provide appropriate compression of the extremity for countermeasure purposes;
194 the same setting was used in this study.
195 Training
196 Approximately four months before launch, each subj ect received two hours of operator
197 and/or subj ect familiarization, including hands-on instruction by an expert sonographer using a
198 simulated ﬂight control environment. All training was performed in the US. Destiny module
199 Human Research Facility simulator (J ohnson Space Center — Houston) containing a ﬂight-
200 modiﬁed ATL HDI-SOOO (ATL/Philips, Seattle, USA) ultrasound system. The P4-2 phased
201 array cardiac ultrasound probe (1-4 MHZ) was used for cardiac imaging, and L12-5 linear array
202 probe was used to demonstrate the vascular imaging procedures. This conﬁguration was
203 identical to the one in the Destiny module of the 188.
204 On Orbit Data Acquisition
205
206 The study spanned three consecutive ISS Expeditions with siX, ﬁve and four sessions
207 respectively involving nine erewmembers from 33 to 185 days after launch (101d: 46,
208 meaniSD). N0 ground data were collected before or after the mission, as each crewmember
209 served as their own control.
210 During each on-orbit session, real-time Video from the ISS ultrasound system was
211 transmitted to Mission Control Center - Houston (MCC-H), and two-way private audio channel
212 with the crew was available for verbal discourse. The erewmembers were guided through each
213 step of the study protocol, which typically took 60 minutes to perform. (Figure I.)
214 The astronauts were allowed to reﬁne speciﬁc restraining techniques for both the subj eet
215 and the operator to allow unrestricted use of the keyboard, access to the thoracic region and both
216 thigh areas of the subj ect, and assure mutual stability for the examination in the microgravity
217 environment. Attention was paid to the prevention of hand fatigue of the operator. In some
218 cases, the subj eet assisted with ultrasound keyboard manipulations while simultaneously being
219 scanned. The subj eet exerted very little effort to perform this task and therefore this activity
220 would have had a negligible effect on cardiac performance.
221
222 The cardiac ultrasound examination was conducted using the four-chamber apical View

"
"8","8
223 primarily, with sub-costal four-chamber View as the alternative, and involved B, M, Pulsed Wave
224 Doppler, and Tissue Doppler modes. Probe repositioning and change-outs were minimized to
225 enhance image acquisition and reduce examination duration. (Figure I) The probe position was
226 optimized per the remote sonographer’s voice commands to achieve the desired images. The
227 remote guidance team made real-time decisions on the quality of the apical View and the need for
228 an alternative approach. All remote guiders were registered diagnostic cardiac sonographers
229 (RDCS) and registered vascular technologists (RVT) by the American Registry for Diagnostic
230 Medical Sonography (ARDMS). (2)
231 All sessions were conducted in a consistent manner with cardiac and peripheral vascular
232 ultrasound being acquired ﬁrst without Braslet during three test conditions (baseline, a modiﬁed
233 Valsalva maneuver, and a modiﬁed Mueller maneuver), and then under the same conditions after
234 the Braslet had been applied on both thighs for 10 to 30 minutes. The modiﬁed respiratory
235 maneuvers were performed by eXhaling 0r inhaling through a plastic tube of standardized length
236 and diameter to limit airway pressures to i 400m H20. (unpublished results) The subj eets were
237 trained to spread the respiratory effort over 8 t010 seconds starting at baseline, which was
238 demonstrated in ground experiments to maintain a constant airway pressure within the above
239 limits.(Figure 2) At the end of the ‘Braslet—On” session, a cardiac four chamber or RV TD was
240 obtained during the rapid release of the Braslet to observe the effect of the ﬂuid sequestered in
241 the lower extremities returning to the effective circulating volume.
242 All the ultrasound images were reviewed and analyzed by registered sonographers and a
243 cardiologist certified by the National Board of Eehocardiography(l) external to the investigator
244 group, to verify the diagnostic quality of the data. All the parameters listed in Table 1 were
245 measured in three different frames or cardiac cycles. In some subjects, data points from a
246 particular step of the protocol were rej eeted due to poor quality; however, data of acceptable
247 ﬁdelity were obtained from all subj eets.
248 Statistical Methods
249 Data analysis consisted of two phases. Phase I was an exploratory analysis designed to
250 identify outcome parameters (Table 1) that showed evidence of being affected by the Braslet for
251 any or all of the test conditions. For this phase, we made 110 distributional assumptions and used
252 Somers D, a non-parametric measure of association to describe consistency of change with
253 regard to Braslet status (011 or off) taking into account differences between subj eets and possibly

"
"9","9
254 ﬂight days within a mission for the same subj eet. In Table 1, combinations of parameters and
255 test conditions were ﬂagged ( see ‘stars’in Table 1) as showing statistically significant change if
256 P-Values for the test H0: D = 0 were below the critical threshold of 0.019, as determined by
257 controlling the false discovery rate to 10% using the method of Benj amini, Krieger and
258 Yekutieli(10) with a nominal test level of OL = .05. The false discovery rate (FDR) is the
259 expected proportion of rej eeted hypotheses that in fact were null and should not have been
260 rej ected.
261 In Phase II, we used a parametric mixed model to describe each parameter’s response,
262 with and without the Braslet, and under each of the three test conditions (baseline, Valsalva,
263 Mueller). For some outcome parameters 10g transformations were made before analysis. The
264 model included random effects for subj eets as well as sessions (i.e. ﬂight days) for a given
265 subj ect. From each fitted model, we made multiple comparisons between the interaction of
266 Braslet (011, off) and test condition (baseline, Valsalva, Mueller) for each outcome parameter. As
267 was the case in Phase I, correction for multiple inferences 0n 3 comparisons for each of 27
268 parameters had to be made. To do this, we again used the method of Benj amini, et. a1(10), but
269 this time with the more conservative FDR control of 5%. In this case the critical p—Value
270 threshold was 0.0075 , again with a nominal level of OL = 0.05. Estimated values of Braslet effects
271 (% change in mean i SE) are shown in Table 1 for each parameter and test condition.
272 Signiﬁcant effects (p < 0.0075) of test condition as identified by the Benj amini, et a1. multiple-
273 comparison procedure are in shown on the right.
274 Results
275
276 Table 1 summarizes results from 17 experiment sessions conducted on 9 subj eets. Out of the 17
277 sessions scheduled, 15 successfully produced a useful set of data. Some anomalies included:
278 0 One session - not performed due to ultrasound hardware failure
279 0 One session - cardiac image data were not captured properly due to a procedural error
280 0 One session - 110 ECG tracing was obtained with vascular images
281 0 One session - last 50% of data lost due to hardware failure.
282 0 One session - not performed due to scheduling constraints
283 0 One session - respiratory maneuvers not properly synchronized causing difﬁculties with
284 data analysis.

285 Phase 1 Analysis: Effect of Braslet alone on Respiratory Maneuvers
286
287 Insert Table 1 here
288
289 After correcting for multiple testing (see Statistical Methods), the Braslet cuff was
290 identified as producing a statistically signiﬁcant effect 011 the mean response during at least one
291 type of maneuver (including baseline) in 10 0f the 27 parameters measured. In particular,
292 significant decreases with application of the cuff were observed in cardiac output, LV Stroke
293 volume, left lateral E', Mitral A and E wave velocity, and right IVRT during baseline; left lateral
294 A' and E' during the modiﬁed Valsalva maneuver; and left lateral E', right IVRT, and right TEI
295 index during the modified Mueller maneuver. Signiﬁcant increases were observed in Mitral
296 deceleration time (baseline and Valsalva) and in FEM V area (baseline) (stars in Table 1).
297 Eehocardiographic normal parameters were studied 011 the 188 by Hamilton et a1(31) and using
298 their data, the magnitude and direction of the changes reported in Table 1 can be approximated
299 for these subj eets.
300
301 Phase 2 Analysis: Comparison of Valsalva, Mueller and Baseline
302 +Maneuvers with and without Braslet
303 Again after correction for multiple testing, we observed statistical evidence that the effect
304 of the Braslet cuff (011 vs. off) was significantly different in 7 parameters between at least two of
305 the maneuvers (including baseline) (last column of Table 1). More specifically, parameters
306 showing evidence of this differential change were cardiac output, heart rate, IJV area, LV
307 diastolic volume, left lateral S', mitral deceleration time, and right lateral E'.
308
309 Braslet Release
310 After completing all the imaging components with maneuvers in Braslet-OFF and
311 Braslet-ON states, the cardiac probe was positioned to get a continuous four-chamber View. The
312 operator crewmember rapidly released the Velcr0® straps on both Braslet cuffs, and at least 10
313 cardiac cycles were reeorded.(see discussion) Unfortunately, the four-chamber View (11:6) was
314 difﬁcult to maintain during the Braslet release, resulting in deviation of the imaging plane from
315 its original position; therefore, it was replaced with the more stable Tissue Doppler View (11:9).

316 Discussion
3 17
318 Herault et a1(32) reported that despite extensive training of Mir cosmonauts before ﬂight,
319 the quality of the ultrasound data obtained in-ﬂight may be inadequate. To assure precise
320 execution of the study protocol and quality of the data of our study, both the ultrasound Video
321 and the cabin View Video were streamed in real time to the NASA Telescienee Center, enabling
322 continuous control of the experiment and verbal guidance of the crew by investigators. Each
323 image and each eine-loop used in the analysis were acquired by the astronauts only when the
324 ground-based expert considered the image adequate and commanded acquisition. Thus, an
325 established system of balanced expertise distribution enabled data acquisition with quality that
326 was acceptable for real-time assessment and thorough retrospective analysis.
327 Tissue Doppler (TD) was used for the ﬁrst time in space ﬂight during this investigation.
328 As an excellent means to assess cardiac performance, TD method is of particular importance for
329 long-duration space ﬂight.(Figure 4) TD spectra were taken from the left ventricular (LV) lateral
330 wall, septum, and right ventricular (RV) free wall. Furthermore, TD spectra are easier to obtain
331 and less vulnerable to motion artifacts than 2D eehocardiographie Views. In our subj eets, LV
332 Lateral E' decreased by more than 20% with the application of Braslet regardless of the
333 maneuver, and LV Lateral A' decreased only when Braslet was applied and a Valsalva maneuver
334 was performed. RV iso-volumie relaxation time decreased by more than 20% with the Braslet
335 applied and by more than 30% when a Mueller was simultaneously performed. This indicates
336 that preload was reduced with Braslet and that at these reduced end diastolic volumes the
337 reduced intrathoraeie pressure from Mueller made the tricuspid valve open sooner. Mitral pulsed
338 wave Doppler velocity of the LV inﬂow is a load-dependent parameter and decreases in response
339 to reduced preload.(34; 40) By decreasing preload with Braslet, both Valsalva and Mueller
340 seemed to have caused a modest reduction in LV preload as demonstrated by smaller velocities
341 or extended relaxation slopes. Impaired LV filling is seen with Valsalva secondary to increased
342 thoracic pressure while Mueller produces a similar result as a consequence of increased RV
343 afterload from the subatmospheric intrathoraeie pressure and the small end diastolic cavitary and
344 pericardial volumes created by the Braslet.(Figure 5)
345 Femoral vein (FV) area increased by 89% with the application of the Braslet. This
346 change was less pronounced (51%) when a Valsalva maneuver was compared pre/post Braslet,

"
"12","12
347 since pre-Braslet Valsalva already increased the FV area. This observation provides evidence
348 that the Braslet, when worn and calibrated correctly, still allows for thoracic maneuvers to have a
349 demonstrable effect on lower-extremity venous ﬁlling. The pressure from occlusion cuffs
350 compresses the superficial veins more than the deep oiroulation.(14; 24; 35) Although Herault et
351 a1(32) reported the UV area decrease in space ﬂight with Braslet applied, we could effect
352 significant changes in IJV area only when Braslet was combined with thoracic maneuvers.
353 Cardiac output signiﬁcantly decreased by 19% and stroke volume decreased by 12%
354 when the Braslet was worn, and the heart rate compensation changed signiﬁcantly in the
355 increasing direction during a Valsalva maneuver. These ﬁndings are consistent with Pouroelot
356 and Pottier(43-45) who reported a decrease in stroke volume (~20% ) and cardiac output (~20%)
357 using eohooardiography with thigh compression during a short-duration Frenoh-Soviet Salyut
358 ﬂight in 1982. On ﬂight day 4, they used pneumatic thigh cuffs at 40 and 60 mmHg, which is
359 similar to the constraining stress of the Braslet measured by Hamilton et al (unpublished results)
360 using balloon pressure transducers(29). Diridollou et a1(17) reported that the Braslet used in their
361 HDT study provided the equivalent of 30 mmHg ‘oounterpressure” over the area of its
362 application on the upper thigh. Lindgen et a1(37) observed a 3% increase in 1eg volume with 120
363 head down ti1t with thigh cuffs inﬂated to 50 mmHg for 15 minutes, however these subj eots
364 would have been considered hypervolemio compared to microgravity.
365 Herault et a1(32) measured the effects of wearing the Braslet for ﬁve hours on siX
366 cosmonauts during a 6-month stay on the Mir space station and reported stroke volume and
367 cardiac output reduction of 15% and 14% respectively after one month of space ﬂight. It is
368 interesting to note that these changes became minuscule after three months of space ﬂight, and
369 the Braslet actually increased stoke volume and cardiac output after ﬁve months of space ﬂight.
370 They also report that femoral vein area increased by ~20% with the Braslet applied at one and
371 three months, but ﬁve months into the ﬂight this increase was only 9%. We did not observe this
372 trend on any subj eot. Muscle atrophy was more prevalent in pre-ISS missions, altering the ﬁt
373 and, therefore, the efficacy of the Braslet (26; 52); the ISS countermeasures system is far more
374 effective at preventing muscle atrophy and exercise deoonditioning. Hamilton et a1(31)
375 performed a prospective eohooardiographio study in siX ISS orewmembers 152, 116, 149, 34,
376 190, and 41 days after launch, and found no clinically signiﬁcant differences between
377 cardiovascular parameters acquired on-orbit compared to pre- and post- mission data. We

"
"13","13
378 therefore believe that mission length up to 6 months does not have a signiﬁcant effect on the
379 outcome of this study.
380 The myocardial performance index (Tei index (49)) is calculated using diastolic and
381 systolic time intervals derived from TD spectra as a combined measure of myocardial
382 performance. The RV Tei index exceeded the normal terrestrial value of < 0.3(27) in all but one
383 subj ect.
384 Diridollou et al(17) used high frequency ultrasound to demonstrate the increase in
385 forehead skin thickness (2.8%) and decrease in tibial skin thickness (3.5%) when subj eets are
386 placed in 6OHDT. When Braslet was applied during 7 days of HDT, the forehead thickness
387 decreased to 0.6% of baseline compared to the control group which increased to 6.4%. Arbeille
388 et al (4; 8) measured IJV distension and facial edema in a head-down tilt (HDT) study.
389 Compared to supine values they found that facial skin thickness increased by 5% after seven
390 days of HDT but, after wearing the Braslet for eight hours the skin thickness was reduced by 5%.
391 This agrees with the subj ective comments by Herault et al(32), which document that all
392 astronauts who wore the Braslet during their study in space claim to have had a “sensation of
393 comfort.” MatsneV et al(3 8) reported that when Braslet was employed on Soyuz-38 the
394 cosmonauts reported a reduction in space adaptation syndrome symptoms (dizziness, congestion
395 and headaches).
396 Kirsch et al(3 6) measured CVP after 22 hours of microgravity during the Spacelab 1
397 mission and found it to be less than the preﬂight supine levels in two subj eets. They repeated
398 this during the Spacelab D1 missions and found that the CVP again fell to levels below preﬂight
399 supine 20 to 40 minutes after liftoff. This is consistent with the ﬁndings by Buekey et al (12),
400 which found that invasive CVP fell to 2.5 cm H20 immediately at the transition to microgravity
401 on the Space Life Sciences 1 mission. Foldager et al(20) reported that CVP decreased to 6.5 -
402 2.0 mmHg after three hours of microgravity exposure during the Spacelab D2 (n=4) and Space
403 Life Sciences 2 (n=2) missions.
404 Although Braslet did not induce a profound change in U V area despite the obvious
405 reduced cardiac preload, thoracic maneuvers seemed to have a profound additive effect when the
406 Braslet was applied. This implies that the UV is close to the pressure required to maintain its
407 unstressed volume (i.e., to saturate its ﬁlling capacity) and that a Mueller maneuver will decrease
408 its eross-seetional area. The Mueller — Valsalva difference is instructive since Valsalva caused a

"
"14","14
409 small increase in IJV area, implying the vein was close to being maximally distended despite the
410 reduced cardiac preload caused by the Braslet. Nonetheless, the UV area decreases significantly
411 when a Mueller maneuver is performed.(Figure 6) This finding is consistent with the UV, which
412 takes very little CVP t0 distend it maximally, has a low enough CVP to be manipulated with
413 limited thoracic pressures when Braslet is applied. This can be replicated at the bedside on a
414 healthy patient by observing the change in fullness of the jugular venous pulse when raising or
415 lowering the patient’s neck by only one inch. Therefore, a Mueller maneuver with Braslet
416 applied in microgravity seems to decrease the CVP acutely to less than 2 mmHg. This is
417 consistent with the maintenance of RV preload under normal terrestrial conditions where RV
418 transmural pressures are approximately 1.5 mmHg in humans.(28)
419 The monitoring of the UV using thoracic maneuvers may replace the terrestrial bedside
420 JVP to determine volume status of the microgravity patient. We agree with the hypothesis of
421 Tyberg et al(5 3) suggesting a mechanism by which blood volume changes might explain the
422 hypotension seen following return to normal gravity after space ﬂight. Upon entering
423 microgravity, lower-extremity peripheral veins signiﬁcantly reduce in volume and, because of
424 volume redistribution, distend the right atrium even though CVP is decreased. After some time
425 in space, homeostatic mechanisms may cause a decrease in vascular volume and reduce the
426 pressure in the central venous compartment to values below what is found on Earth but adequate
427 to provide the necessary preload for the heart. The new set point for central venous pressure may
428 be a combination of the pressure that provides the external constraint to the lower extremity
429 venous system or the pericardial constraint of the heart under long-duration microgravity
430 conditions. The RV end-diastolie pressure, which approximates the CVP, is mostly determined
431 by pericardial constraint even at low ﬁlling pressures.(22) Nonetheless, large changes in
432 intrathoraeie pressure manifest themselves more profoundly in microgravity when the Braslet is
433 applied, which is similar to their effect on a hypovolemic patient. We propose that a human in
434 space who is euvolemic by microgravity standards has less hemodynamic volume reserve
435 compared to their terrestrial counterpart and would be more susceptible to hypovolemic shock
436 for the same intravascular volume less.
437 During the Braslet release the four-chamber images consistently show an immediate
438 increase in LV stroke volume, which oscillated in magnitude over several beats and stabilized to
439 a value that was close to the pre-Braslet application. The increased stroke volume after the

"
"15","15
440 Braslet release stabilized Within 10 beats, Which suggests that a significant amount of the volume
441 in the leg must have been sequestered in the extra-vasoular space.(Figure 7) These results may
442 be consistent With Fujimoto et al(22), Who showed that ventricular interaction modulates LV
443 performance even at low ﬁlling pressures. They performed lower-body negative pressure
444 (LBNP) (- 30 mmHg) on humans and observed a reduction in stroke volume of 3% despite a
445 transient increase in RV preload. Perhaps the oscillatory nature of the response following
446 Braslet release observed in our subj eots may be due to perioardial-ventrioular interaction or a
447 baroreﬂeX response.(22) Hinghofer-Szalkay et al(33) demonstrated that 35 mmHg of LBNP
448 could be ‘oounter balanced” With 27.5° of HDT. Given that the Braslet is calibrated to
449 ameliorate the effect of 300 HDT, it may have an effect on the lower extremities similar to -30
450 mmHg of LBNP.
451 The capability of Braslet to acutely reduce the persisting IJV distension suggests their
452 possible use as a therapeutic capability, likely in combination With other measures, to control
453 certain medical hazards in space. For example, the chronically dilated venous system of the
454 neck, and presumably other cranial venous structures, may play a role in the pathophysiology
455 responsible for occasionally noted moderate elevation of intracranial pressure. Some
456 orewmembers report changes in their Visual acuity requiring corrections of more than 2 diopters.
457 In some orewmembers, postﬂight Visual acuity changes remain abnormal for months and
458 fundosoopio examinations revealed papilledema and ohoroidal folds. MRI and ultrasound
459 examinations of the eye in these orewmembers also demonstrated optic disc edema, posterior
460 ﬂattening of the globe, or dilated optic nerve sheaths, Which is similar to patients With idiopathic
461 intraoranial hypertension.(3; 25) The results of this study suggest that the application of Braslet
462 in combination With thoracic maneuvers may play a role in understanding, and possibly
463 mitigating, this space ﬂight concern that is not fully understood at this time.
464 Braslet device in microgravity would likely be effective for the treatment of high-
465 pressure pulmonary edema, since in microgravity all regions of the lung are susceptible to
466 pulmonary edema at the same left atrial pressure. It may stand to reason, in microgravity, that
467 when a higher initial pressure of 30 em H20 is achieved, sudden global alveolar ﬂooding will
468 most likely occur. Appearance of crackles anywhere in the thoraX in the setting of ﬂuid overload
469 may then indicate impending fulminant pulmonary edema. The Braslet could help control this
470 condition in a manner similar to nitrates or thigh cuffs on Earth until diuretics can be used.

471 Conclusion
472 The Braslet device acutely reduces the effective circulating volume by sequestering ﬂuid
473 in the lower extremities, as directly observed by vascular ultrasound and supported by the
474 reduced preload indiees measured by echocardiography. Vascular ultrasound conﬁrmed reduced
475 distention 0f the jugular venous system and increased sensitivity of the jugular vein area to
476 thoracic maneuvers. These findings combined with subj ective comments from erewmembers
477 suggest that the relative cranial venous insufﬁciency caused by microgravity is partially
478 alleviated by the Braslet. The hazards secondary to wearing the occlusive Braslet cuffs in
479 microgravity for an extended time (greater than 1 hour) are unknown, although in some studies
480 the device was worn for longer than 6 hours.
481 Following conservative safety considerations, this experiment established an effective set
482 of modiﬁcations to the widely used respiratory maneuvers, introducing their open-glottis,
483 limited-pressure modifications. These physiologically gentle and unequivocal respiratory
484 maneuvers were shown to cause statistically significant hemodynamic effects.
485 A statistically signiﬁcant reduction in jugular venous filling was also observed during
486 Braslet application, which coupled with negative airway pressure to consistently collapse the
487 IJV. This effect has important diagnostic and therapeutic implications for space medicine, and
488 should be further studied from both perspectives.
489 Remotely guided ultrasound provides an effective and obj ective means of measuring the
490 physiological effects of the Braslet and produces data quality that is superior to previous
491 investigations in space. Valsalva and Mueller maneuvers appear to enhance the ability at the
492 microgravity bedside to determine volume status.
