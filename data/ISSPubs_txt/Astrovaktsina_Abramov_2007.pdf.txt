Received January 22, 2007
The virulence antigen (V-antigen, Lch) of Yersinia pestis, the causative agent of bubonic plague, is an
established protective antigen known to regulate, target, and mediate type III translocation of cytotoxic
yersiniae outer proteins termed Yops; Lch also prompts TLR2—dependent upregulation of anti—
inflammatory |L-10. In this study, we determined the parameters of specific interaction of Lch with
TLR2 expressed on human transfected HEK293 cells (TLR2VCD14‘), VTECZ.HS cells (TLR2‘VCD14‘),
primary monocytes (TLR2t/CD14+), and THP—1 cells (TLR2+XCD14+). The IRRL314W317 motif of the
extracellular domain of human and mouse TLRZ accounted for high-affinity binding of Lch. The CD14
co—receptor did not influence this interaction. Lch did not bind to human U937 (TLR2“/CD14‘) and
alveolar macrophages (TLR2‘/CD14+) in the absence of receptor-bound human lFN-y or a synthetic
C—terminal fragment (hIFN—}r132_143). The latter, but not mouse lFN-y (or synthetic control peptides), shared
a GRRA133_141 site necessary for high—affinity specific binding. Lch of Y. pestis shares the N-terminai
LEEL32w35 binding site of Yersinia enterocolitica and also has an exposed internal DEEIZOHOG binding
site. Comparison of binding constants and consideration of steric restrictions indicate that binding is
not cooperative and only the internal site binds Lch to target cells. Both the LEEL32_35 and DEE|203w206
binding sites are removed by five amino acids from DKN residues associated with biological activity
of bound Lch. Lch of Y. pestis promoted both TLR2/CD‘I4-dependent and TLR2/CD14-independent
amplification of an10 and concomitant downregulation of TNF-a in human target cells. The ability of
Lch to utilize human lFN-y (a major inflammatory effector of innate immunity) to minimize inflammation
is insidious and may account in part for the severe symptoms of plague in man.
