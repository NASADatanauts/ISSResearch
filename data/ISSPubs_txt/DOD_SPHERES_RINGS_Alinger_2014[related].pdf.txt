A method of using loading capacitors of varying sizes to experimentally determine the alternating current behavior of
resistance and inductance for a multilayer ﬂat spiral coil is presented. For the presented coil design, the Dowel] method is
shown to underpredict the alternating current resistance of the coil by as much as a factor of 4 for frequencies up to
10 kHz. A classical modification to the Dowel] method produces improved results but still underpredicts the alternating
current resistance by as much as a factor of 2. Curve ﬁts of the form used in Dowell’s method are applied to
ﬂ experimentally obtained data, allowing for the identiﬁcation of the frequency at Which Wireless power transfer efﬁciency
g is maximized. In addition, an analytical approach to predicting coil impedance vs the duty cycle of a rectangular wave
2 applied voltage is presented and is shown to agree well With experimentally obtained results.
