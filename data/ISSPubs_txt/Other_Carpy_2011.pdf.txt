Abstract: End Of 2009 and early 2010 a sealed cell, for foam generation and Observation, has
been designed and manufactured at Astrium Friedrichshafen facilities. With the use Of this cell,
different sample compositions of ""wet foams"" have been Optimized for mixtures of chemicals
such as water, dodecanol, pluronic, aethoxiselerol, glycerol, CTAB, SDS, as well as glass beads.
This development is performed in the frame of the breadboarding development activities of the
Experiment Container FOAM-C for Operation in the ISS Fluid Science Laboratory (188). The
sample cell supports multiple Observation methods such as: Difﬁasing-Wave and Diffuse
Transmission Spectrometry, Time Resolved Correlation Spectroscopy [l] and microscope
Observation, all Of these methods are applied in the cell With a relatively small experiment
volume <3cm3. These units, Will be on orbit replaceable sets, that Will allow multiple sample
compositions processing (in the range of >40).
1. Introduction
Foaming processes are used on a large scale in the mining industry, for ﬁre ﬁghting and food
production, but they can also be limiting factors for improved efﬁciency in many chemical industries
like food and cosmetics production, but also in the oil industry. The experiment FOAM-C (Foam and
Optics Mechanics - Coarsening) studies the coarsening process of aqueous wet foam as a function of
liquid volume fraction and liquid characteristics. MicrograVity allows investigating highly wet foam,
Which cannot be studied in detail in the earth laboratory due to drainage. Previous experiments have
been performed in the frame of the FOAM project, such as parabolic ﬂight campaigns, the Foam-S on
the ISS (focused on foams stability) or the experiments in the MAXUS 6 rocket [2]. NOW an extensive
foam coarsening experiment under microgravity conditions for several types of probes and

measurement periods as long as 24hrs for each sample experiment foam is foreseen to be performed on
the 188.

For the experiment on the 188, where the storage times before experiment execution can be of
several months, one of the crucial development points is the foam generation and quality of the
generated foam. The foaming device shall be capable of generating wet foams with different surfactants
and with a homogeneous initial size of foam bubbles (<100 pm), as described later in the materials and
methods section.

More than 40 samples are foreseen to be processed for the ﬁrst experiment mission to 188. A
concept of on-orbit replaceable sealed samples has been developed, avoiding the need of a ﬂuid waste
reservoir or on orbit sample cleaning.

The foreseen experiment sequence for the on-orbit execution is: 1) ground sample preparation with
pre-deﬁned ﬁlling procedures, concentrations and liquid fraction, 2) on-orbit foam generation, 3) foam
coarsening observation with overview camera, diffusing wave spectroscopy in reﬂection (DWS) and
transmission (DTS) and time resolved correlation spectroscopy (TRC), 4) repeat steps 2 and 3 for all
samples is present.

The summary of breadboarding tests performed to demonstrate the foam generation capabilities of
the system with the different experiment liquids is presented within the following chapters, additionally
the initial system characterization to verify compatibility of the optical diagnostics concept to the foam
coarsening observation methods have been performed.

2. Materials and Methods

The materials used for the experiment are: Dodeoanol, increasing the surface Visooelastioity of the
bubbles and probably decreasing the coarsening rate; Glycerol increasing the bulk Viscosity and
decreasing the coarsening rate; TTAB ionic surfactant, chemically very stable; and SDS as backup of
the TTAB. Additionally, the following chemicals were tested: C12G2, as non-ionio surfactant in backup
of TTAB; Pluronios a polymeric surfactant that adsorbs irreversibly at the air-water surface;
Aethoxisolerol a pharmaceutical product for varicose veins; and Glass beads to study how a network of
particles, linked by attractive oapillar bridges, affects coarsening and bubble rearrangement dynamics.
All of these chemicals, except Aethoxisolerol were tested as mixtures with different pure water
concentrations. For the Diffusing Wave Spectroscopy Baokseattering and Transmission measurements,
Gillette shaving foam was used.

The setup for the foaming tests consists of a polycarbonate cell with thickness of 2mm and outer
dimensions 53 X 25 X 20 mm (see Fig. 1), which contains a moving piston. The cell is cleaned with
ethanol and an ultrasonic bath prior to ﬁlling. After the cleaning, the cell is ﬁlled with the desired
concentration and liquid fraction and sealed. The sealing of the sample with a Viton o-ring and screws,
has three main advantages, which are: the liquid volume and concentration, are well deﬁned and kept
known during all phases of the experiment. The tests can be repeated with the same sample, as often as
needed; and additionally there is no liquid waste, which would limit the experiment life on-orbit, due to
limited available volume for liquid waste.

The foam is generated by a shearing force, occurring at the gap (1mm on each side) between the
moving piston and the sample cell body. The piston, which contains a set of magnets, within its body, is
magnetically coupled to the outside of the cell. The piston is driven with a frequency of 10Hz in all
cases. The foam sample thickness L=1.1om, height is 1.10m and width 1.40m. All experiments are
carried out under normal gravity conditions at a temperature of 21i0.50C.

The methods used for the observation (see Fig. 2) 0f the foam coarsening are, a CCD-camera for
top-View observation of the ﬁrst layer of bubbles, in the upper window of the sample cell, with siX
LEDs accurately placed below the sample, to provide both enough contrast and illumination for bubble
observation. The additional light-scattering measurements (DWS, DTS and SVS) were illuminated with
an expanded laser light beam (0.8mm 0n the foam surface), with a wavelength k=532nm. The
wavelength has no inﬂuence for the extrapolation ratio Ze, or the transport mean free path, 1* for
aqueous foams as known from [3].

3. Results

The foams were prepared in different concentrations, such as: Dodecanol 2% of total mass, Glycerol
25% volume fraction, SDS 8g/1, TTAB 4.5 g/l, C12G2 0.2g/1, Pluronics 17.5 g/l, and the glass beads 15%
0f fraction of liquid. This means, a total of 13 sample compositions were tested. For each composition,
different liquid fractions (LF) were tested with increments of 1% of liquid fraction for the 5-10% range
and increments of 10% for 10-50%. Each test has been repeated 3 times to verify reproducibility. This
sums up 390 measurements.

The success criterion was based on overview pictures of the foam sample cell (Fig. 3) for the study
of the coarsening process, the required initial sample characteristics, have been as follows: an average
bubble size <100 pm, maximum bubble size <5*average diameter, and a standard deviation between
0.3-3times the average bubble size.

The samples With SDS provided the Widest range of liquid fractions for Which the foam generation is
possible, in some cases With liquid fractions as low as 5%. Note that SDS is not as chemically stable as
the TTAB (hydrolysis is present), Which may be a problem if the solutions are studied only weeks after
preparation. Tests carried out for the samples With TTAB have provided also high foaming properties
and compatibility to the success criteria.

The results obtained With solutions containing C12G2, C12G2+Dodeeanol + glycerol + water,
pluronie surfactants and AethOXiselerol were similar.

After the experiments performed to identify the liquid compositions and liquid fractions Where
foams 0f the required characteristics could be obtained, additional experiments With the setup, were
executed for the additional light scattering methods. In this case, measurements under normal gravity
conditions have been performed (Fig. 6) similar to [4], Where comparison With other validated test
setups and calculation of the average bubble size diameter using Gillette shaving foam has been
performed.

From the output of the multiple tau autoeorrelation the Siegert equation is used, then the formulas for
g1(t) for backseattering and transmission are used in line With [5] and [7].

Fig. 6 Multiple-Tau Autocorrelation function of Gillette foam after 20mins for Diffusing Wave Spectro-
scopy Backscattering (upper-left) and Transmission (upper-right) and comparison. The logarithm of the
correlation function g1 roughly scales linearly With delay time in the ease of transmission, and as the
square root of delay time in the ease of backseattering. This is consistent With previous light scattering
experiments With coarsening foams. The sample is Gillette shaving foam, at an age of 20min.

Following the reference measurements, following tests have been performed for functionality of
optic and light scattering diagnostics. In this example, the coarsening of a probe of SDS+water With a
liquid fraction of 20% has been evaluated. Following on the simpliﬁcation applied in [6] Where
T z5! */3L the sample shows a linear behavior between the transport mean free path of light (1*) versus
the average bubble diameter (Fig. 7). The relationship for this probe was l*=(1.2i0.05)d. The
coefﬁcient of this law Will be reﬁned in further analyses, taking into account a more accurate
description of the optical boundary conditions. Out of this graphs, a clear short-time coarsening of the
foam SDS+water (Within 5 minutes), compared With other foams Where times above 1000min [7] is
observed. The bubble growth illustrated in Fig. 7 is different (linear) from the parabolic law usually
observed in coarsening foams, possibly due to drainage effects. The growth rate of the bubbles under
microgravity Where drainage Will not be present is one of the parameters to be evaluated during the ISS
Foam-C experiment. The results are comparable to similar measurements performed Within [8] Where a
bubble size 0f214011m is measured for 21 SDS sample With LF15% after 120 seconds.

4. Conclusions
In summary, we have described series of measurements for foam generation Within a sealed volume,
With different samples varying the composition, concentrations and liquid fractions With an objective of
generating homogeneous foams With an average bubble diameter below 1001mm At the beginning of the
measurements, it was not possible to deﬁne, Which of these samples composition could be used for
foam generation to fulﬁll the target foam homogeneity and size. After this campaign, an envelope
containing the ranges and compositions of ﬂuid, for Which wet foams can be generated With the
described test setup, has been deﬁned and Will be used as a baseline for the future development of the
Experiment Container Foam-C for the International Space Station. In this sense, the results of these
investigations have been successfully ﬁnished. The optic diagnostics have provided as well initial
measurements and compatibility With previous theories or measurements With e.g. shaving cream.

An additional parabolic ﬂight campaign is foreseen in spring 2012 to continue the investigations of
the generation of aqueous foams under microgravity, as well as, the use and calibration of multiple
light-seattering methods, in View of the Foam-C mission preparation for the ISS.
