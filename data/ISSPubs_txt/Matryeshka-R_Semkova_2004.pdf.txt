Abstract
Described is the Liulin—5 experiment and instrumentation, developed for investigation of the space radiation doses depth dis—
tribution in a human phantom on the Russian Segment of the International Space Station (ISS). Liulin—5 experiment is a part of the
international project MATROSHKA-R on ISS. The experiment MATROSHKA—R is aimed to study the depth dose distribution at
the sites of critical organs of the human body, using models of human body—anthropomorphic and spherical tissue—equivalent
phantoms. The aim of Liulin-S experiment is long term (4—5 years) investigation of the radiation environment dynamics inside the
spherical tissue—equivalent phantom, mounted in different places of the Russian Segment of ISS. Energy deposition spectra, linear
energy transfer spectra, ﬂux and dose rates for protons and the biologically—relevant heavy ion components of the galactic cosmic
radiation Will be measured simultaneously With near real time resolution at different depths of the phantom by a telescope of silicon
detectors. Data obtained together With data from other active and passive dosimeters Will be used to estimate the radiation risk to
the crewmeinbers, verify the models of radiation environment in low Earth orbit, validate body transport model and correlate organ
level dose to skin dose. Presented are the test results of the prototype unit. The spherical phantom Will be ﬂown on the ISS in 2004
year and Liulin-S experiment is planned for 2005 year.
