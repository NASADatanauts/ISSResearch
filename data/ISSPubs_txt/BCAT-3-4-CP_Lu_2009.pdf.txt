We investigate liquid-gas phase separation near the critical point of colloid-polymer
mixtures aboard the International Space Station, as part of the BCAT3 and BCAT4 ex-
periments. In this microgravity environment, the higher-density liquid phase does not sink
beneath the lower-density gas phase, as it does on the surface of the earth. Instead, we can
observe the patterns formed during spinodal decomposition, using time—lapse photography
for days to weeks, while previous experiments have been limited to observations of minutes
to hours. We give a primer on phase separation and detail our sample preparation proce-
dures. We also describe the speciﬁc innovations in our photography procedures made by
a number of astronauts on orbit, demonstrating the importance of a manned microgravity
laboratory to our investigation.

I. Introduction

Understanding the spatial structures formed during phase separation is a long—standing problem in fun—
damental physics and Chemistry, With myriad industrial and practical applications. In the case of liquids and
gases, consideration of the structures created by phase separation is often hindered by a density difference
between the two phases; this is particularly problematic When a single material exists as a coexisting liquid
and gas, since a liquid is almost invariably denser than a gas of the same material. Furthermore, how these
structures Change near the critical point—Where the liquid and the gas are no longer distinguishable—is not
easily probed experimentally. We therefore investigate the spatial structure of liquid—gas phase separation
in the microgravity environment of the International Space Station (188), With a set of experiments, BCAT3
and BCAT4.

A typical molecular substance has a well—deﬁned critical point, at a particular value of pressure/density
and temperature. Controlling the density of a sample precisely is straightforward, and any number of
molecular (or atomic) liquids and gases could be created and ﬂown to 188; indeed some have ﬂown in the
past. However, observing structures and their evolution near the critical point also involves maintaining

environment of the ISS, and physically made far more difﬁcult by the divergence of the heat capacity for
critical mixtures.

Instead, we use an athermal colloid—polymer model system to probe structures near the critical pointsgi11
Here, the submicron spherical colloidal particles that diffuse in an otherwise uninvolved background solvent
serve as analogs of atoms or molecules. The particles are made attractive by the depletion force created
by the addition of linear polymers, which form coils in the solvent. In this system, the exact critical point
corresponds to a precise concentration of colloid, and of polymer. Because the depletion force does not
depend on small temperature Changes, the critical point remains ﬁxed over the range of room—temperatures
encountered onboard the ISS and in the laboratory, without any particular temperature control (obviously
the model system will not behave properly if the solvent freezes 0r boils, but is otherwise unaffected by a
wide range of temperatures).

By physically mixing the sample with a magnetic stir bar, the colloidal particles are homogenized and
distributed throughout the sample volume. They then aggregate into Clusters, which soon span the sample
volume in a bicentinuous network: the liquid phase, corresponding to the higher colloid density inside the
Clusters, percolates and coexists with a continuous gas phase, corresponding to lower colloid density. The
network then coarsens as a function of time, in a phase separation process known as spinodal decomposition,
which we capture with macro—photography. A previous experiment has looked a single sample in microgravity,
which coarsened noticeably within minutes to hours;1 here we examine spinodal decomposition far Closer to
the critical point, where samples require days to reach a comparable level of separation.

This conference proceeding describes an experiment we are conducting on—board the International Space
Station (188), entitled BCAT (Binary Colloidal Alloy Test), which involves photographing phase separation
in colloid—polymer mixtures in the microgravity environment of low—earth orbit. We give a ﬁrst—principles
primer on phase separation, detail the speciﬁc methods we use to prepare the samples ﬂown to 188. We also
describe the speciﬁc innovations in the photographic procedures made by each astronaut while performing
the experiment, demonstrating the need for human scientists to run our microgravity experiment.

II. A Primer on Phase Separation and Spinodal Decomposition

This section gives a self—contained, qualitative derivation from ﬁrst—principles for the spinodal and bin—
odal decomposition in liquid—gas phase separation. Although we summarize explanations and derivations
presented by others, the information is included here because we have not found a simple, concise summary
elsewhere.

A. Coexistence Minimizes Free Energy
To understand why a system in equilibrium may undergo phase separation, it is important to consider that
these systems seek to minimize their Helmholtz free energy:

F : U — T S (1)
where U represents the bonding energy between the constituents (e.g. colloids, particles, molecules) in a
system, T is the temperature, and S is their entropy. At high temperature, entropy dominates, and a
typically homogeneous disordered state is favored. At zero temperature, bonding energies will take over,
often favoring much greater order (for example, in atomic or molecular crystals that form many everyday
solids, like metals). At intermediate temperatures, however, the two terms can be of comparable magnitude,
and in many cases, the system can best balance the contributions from U and S in minimizing F by splitting
into two phases, each with a separate density, but in equilibrium with the 0ther.7=12

We can show this explicitly in a simple system with two types of constituents, labeled A and B. The
number of constituents of type A is represented by N A; the number of type B, NB. The total number of
constituents is conserved, and ﬁxed to a total number N , so that:

N : N A + NB (2)
N can be thought of as the total number of discrete sites on a lattice, or possible positions; for a liquid or
gas, these lattice sites do not fall on a periodic grid. The volume fractions of the two constituents are then

1. Entropy of Mixing
The total number of conﬁgurations possible in this system is the number of ways in Which N A objects can
occur in N positions (i. e. N choose NA):

Where the conservation relation in equation 2 has been applied in several places.
2. Energy of Mixing
To understand the energy involved in the mixing process, we deﬁne three constants to Characterize the
bonding between the different constituents: U A A / kBT is the bonding energy between two constituents of
type A; UBB/kBT is the bonding energy between two constituents of type B , and U AB/ kBT is the bonding
energy between one constituent of type A and one of type B. We treat the constituents in the mean—ﬁeld
approximation, so that every constituent is considered to have a coordination number of z (i.e. z nearest—
neighbors on the lattice). In this case, each constituent has ngA neighbors of type A, and ngB neighbors of
type B .
In an unmixed state, Where all A constituents are individually segregated, as are those of type B , the
total energy due to bonding is:
zN 1
Uunmixed = 7 (¢AUAA + ¢BUBB + O [f]) (16)
Where the factor 0f % is included to cut out the double counting. The ﬁnal term is a surface energy due to
the interface—of order %, Which vanishes for large systems—so we subsequently neglect this term.

"4","When the constituents are mixed, the bonding energy has three terms, representing A — A, B — B and
A — B terms. The contribution from A — A bonding is the product of the fraction of A constituents gbA, the
energy per bond U AA, the number A neighbors zqﬁA and 1/2 to cut out the double counting,

N¢A >< UAA >< Z¢A X 2 (17)
The contribution from B — B bonding is analogous, and that from A — B bonding follows a similar logic:
NgbA >< UAB >< Z¢B (18)
but now there is no double counting, so there is no need for the factor of 1/2. The total energy from bonding
in the fully mixed state is:
zN 2 2
Umixed = 7 (¢AUAA + ¢BUBB + 2¢A¢BUAB) (19)
The energy of mixing is the difference between the bonding energy in the fully mixed, and fully unmixed,
states:

A plot of this free energy for a system Where N A=NB is shown, for several different values of x, in ﬁgure 1.
For low values of X g 2, there is a single minimum of the u—shaped free energy curve, at ¢A = $13 = 0.5.
For X > 2, however, the free—energy curve becomes W—shaped, With two distinct minima; this represents a
phase—separation, Where the balance of energy and entropy is minimized by the system splitting into two
distinct parts, each With signiﬁcantly different values of gbA. These values can be determined With a graphical
construction, looking at Where the free—energy curve intersects a common tangent line connecting the two
minima. The equilibrium state is a coexistence between two phases, With these two values of gbA. The
behavior of the system, particularly Whether it separates, can be seen as a function of the temperature, and
the various bond energies contained in x. In general, there Will not be an enforced equality between the
number of constituents, so that N A 7E NB. This tilts the free energy curve, so that the two minima no longer
occur at the same value of the free energy, as shown in ﬁgure 2.

"6","B. Helmholtz Free Energy and the Grand Potential
As described in section A, the Helmholtz free energy F in general follows the form of a tilted W—shaped curve,
Where the two points connected by a common tangent determine the volume fractions of the coexisting phases.
An example is shown in ﬁgure 3, Which is comparable to the higher—X curves shown in ﬁgure 2.

the constituents in a phase—separating system, marked With a solid blue line. The two points connected by a
common tangent (red line) determine the volume fractions of the coexisting phases

In this section, we focus on the grand potential, Which subtracts off the Chemical potential from the
Helmholtz free energy:13

G = F — w (30)
In this representation, the two minima occur at the same value of energy, as shown When the Helmholtz free
energy from ﬁgure 3 is converted to a grand potential, plotted in ﬁgure 4 With a blue curve. Here, we have
recentered the horizontal Q5 axis so that Q5 2 0 corresponds to ¢A : Q53 : 1/2.

Where in the last step the deﬁnition of the diffusion constant from equation 42 is used. As a function of
time, all modes at ﬁnite q decay away, leaving only the mode With q = 0. This reﬂects the conservation
expressed in equation 33. Note that D : 21% formally goes negative for a < 0, Which is a signature of
spinodal decomposition. Once the system has phase separated, the revised analysis belOW—leading to a
positive diffusion constant—is necessary.
Consider now the case a < 0 Where (gb) 7E 0 E (to, so that there is a region enriched With one of the

Which is of the same form as equation 41. We therefore recover ordinary diffusion and the same solution as
in equation 49, except now With a slightly different effective diffusion constant Df:
Df : (2a + 12553)? (59)
This reduces to the original diffusion coefﬁcient in equation 42 When Q50 2 0. Since, in accordance With
equation 32, Q53 : 3—: in equilibrium, we see in this case that:

Which is twice the value of the diffusion constant for the case a > 0 in equation 42.

"9","2. Spinodal and Binodal Decomposition

So long as a is greater than zero, the effective diffusion constant in equation 59 Will be positive, and ordinary
diffusion is observed. However, if a is sufﬁciently negative and Q53 has not yet grown to its equilibrium value,
so that Df < 0, then all hell breaks loose. Fourier modes for q 2 0 grow exponentially in time from the very
beginning (75 = 0), and the expansion quickly breaks down (the growth of Fourier components is stabilised for
large q by higher—order gradient terms). The system is thermodynamically unstable from the very beginning,
and makes frantic attempt to reach equilibrium; this is known as spinodal decomposition. Morphologically,
the two phases form an interpenetrating bi—Continuous network that coarsens until complete phase separation
is achieved.

In between, Where a < 0 but Df > 0, the system Will eventually split into two separate phases, since the
free energy still has two local minima at qﬁ : iqﬁo, away from Aqﬁ = 0. However, because the effective diffusion
constant is still positive, n0 ﬁnite—q modes can grow in the way that occurs for spinodal decomposition.
Instead, droplets of one phase nucleate in the other, and grow in a kinetically—limited process known as
bimodal decomposition (see, for instance, Chapter XII in8).

The boundary between spinodal and binodal decomposition occurs exactly When a < 0 (so that the
equilibrium state is phase—separated), but Df = 0, at particular points along the G(qﬁ) curve. To understand
how this happens, note that, from equations 31 and 59:

520W)
D : F— 61
f 6¢2 ( )
The places Where Df is zero are the same places Where the second derivative of G(gb) is zero—that is, Where
G(gb) has an inﬂection point.

The language in the literature to describe how these relate to boundaries in a phase diagram is, however,
somewhat confusing. The coexistence curve, or bimodal line, is typically What is marked out in traditional
phase diagrams, and refers to the volume fractions of the two phases in an equilibrium coexistence. The
spinodal line refers to the boundary between spinodal and binodal decomposition. The equilibrium state
of ﬁnal coexisting volume fractions is determined by the binodal line, no matter Whether the sample phase
separates by binodal 0r spinodal decomposition.

For a given a and b, then, the spinodal and binodal lines can be determined in terms of gb. At the binodal
line Q5 E gbbin, G(gb) is at a minimum:

gradient terms to account for concentration ﬂuctuations:

2 4 1 "" 2 1 2 2 —»

G(gb) = agb + (9gb + §(ng) + 55 (V gb) clip (69)
where 5 is an arbitrary coefﬁcient. Because everything stays linear, an additional term is added to the ﬁnal
expression for Aqﬁ in equation 58:

8A
a—tib : (2a + 12b¢3)rv2A¢ — 5FV2V2A¢ (70)
Using the Fourier transform method described above yields a solution of form similar to that of equation 49:
A$(q,t) = A$(q, 0)e_w(q)t (71)
Again, because everything stays linear and derivatives become powers of q in Fourier space, the function
w(q) in the exponent is then simply:
w(q) = (2a + 12¢0)Fq2 + 8M4 E qu2 + 8M4 (72)

Since Df < 0, w(q) has a shape similar to that of the blue curve in ﬁgure 4, and minima at q : iq*,

—8(Q)| = 0 (73)
q qEq*

Because —w(q) occurs in the exponent, the wavevectors at its minima, i.e. (1* will grow exponentially faster
than any other length scales in the system; this is the mechanism responsible for creating the Characteristic
length scale that is one hallmark of spinoolal decomposition.

III. Sample Preparation and Characterization

The microgravity environment of the ISS affords us the freedom to optimize our solvent mixture for its
optical properties, without any concern for densities, since particles will be essentially neutrally buoyant in
orbit. We therefore do not have to use any of the halogenated solvents required for buoyancy—matching on
earth,9*11 but can instead use a Cleaner mixture of decahyolronaphthalene (decalin; DHN) anol tetrahydron—
aphthalene (tetralin, THN), which is known to remain stable for the duration of experiments lasting years.
Even though the density is signiﬁcantly less than that of the polymethylrnethacrylate (PMMA) colloidal
spheres, we are able to observe them neutrally buoyant in milliliter—volume samples for weeks to months
without precise temperature control, far longer than can be achieved conveniently on earth.

On the other hand, relative to those samples used in confocal microscope imagingﬁi11 the launched
samples are much larger, and therefore must have a much Closer match between colloid and solvent refractive
index, in order to image these samples without the multiple scattering that would lead to photograph—
obscuring turbidity. The solvent system we use here is a mixture of CDHN and THN in a ratio of 45.00 to
55.00 by mass. This very Closely matches the index of refraction, so that, when particles are Close packed, a
suspension several centimeters thick is still transparent (i.e. single—scattering). In the following subsections,
we describe the Characterization of solvent density ps, solvent Viscosity 775, solvent refractive index ns, colloid
radius a, polymer gyration radius rg, and colloid volume fraction gb, and then detail the colloid—polymer
sample preparation protocol.

A. Solvent Density

We measure the density in two ways. With a macroscopic pycnometer, an approximately 10 mL volumetric
ﬂask is weighed full of water, then weighed when full of the unknown solvent (at the exact same volume),
while temperature is carefully monitored. The ratio between these two measurements yields the density. We
determined all masses using a Mettler AT261DR balance. First, the dry pycnorneter is weighed, then ﬁlled
with water; the net mass of volume of deionized water (18 MS) resistance, from the Millipore Milli—Q ﬁltration

"12","system) that ﬁlls the pycnometer is 9.5290i0.0001 g. After Cleaning and drying, weighing the pycnometer to
oonfrim its cleanliness, we ﬁlled it with the solvent mixture, whose net mass is 8.9200 i0.0001g. Multiplying
the ratio of the two solvent masses by the known density of water (pw 2 0.9975 Ing/mL at 22.4OC) yields
the ﬁnal solvent density ps 2 0.9361pW = 0.933 g/mL.

We measure the density in a second way, using similar principles, with a Mettler AX26DR miorogram
balance, sensitive to $0.002 mg, and a glass capillary with approximately a 10 ,uL capacity as a pycnometer.
The net mass of the deionized water that ﬁlls the capillary is 10.572 i 0.002 mg; the net mass of the same
volume of solvent is 9.882 i 0.002 mg. Multiplying the ratio of the two solvent masses by the known density
of water (0.998 mg/mL at 230C) yields the ﬁnal solvent density of ps 2 0.933 i 0.002 Ing/mL, where the
error bar represents the standard deviation on measurements of seven samples. The result agrees with the
value determined with the pycnometer, as listed above.

B. Solvent Viscosity
Solvent Viscosity 775 can be measured in several ways. One is to use a rheometer, and look at the loss modulus
as a function of frequency. But for solvents with very low Viscosity, the measurements approach the noise
limit for the rheometer, and the resulting data can be unreliable. Instead, we opt for a more traditional
approach: the glass viscometer, a simple glass tube with a well—Characterizeol inner proﬁle through which
a ﬂuid ﬂows for a duration of time directly related to its kinematic Viscosity. The kinematic Viscosity is
multiplied by the solvent density (ps, as determined above to give the dynamic Viscosity, measured in the
more familiar units of oentipoise or milliPascal—seoonols. We use a Cannon—Manning semi—mioro viscometer
of size 50, with a calibrated temperature—olepenolent viscometer constant equal to 0.003921 CSt / s at 1000C
and 0.003931 CSt/s at 400C. We use a constant of 0.003934 CSt/s at 250C for the present measurements.
For temperature stability, the viscometer was held in a water bath consisting of 2—liter beaker on top of a
programmable heater/magnetic stirrer plate (Ika) with active temperature—probe control, set to keep the
water temperature at 25.0 i 0.2OC. The bath was equilibrated for 24 hours before measurements were
made. We ﬁnd the kinematic Viscosity to be 2.320 i 0.006 CSt, where the uncertainty is the standard
deviation of six measurements. Multiplying by the density ps determined above yields a dynamic Viscosity
of 775 : 2.165 i 0.005 mPa—s. We also Checked the viscometer by measuring the Viscosity of deionized
water in the same setup, and found a kinematic Viscosity of 0.919 i 0.005 CSt and a dynamic Visocity of
77w : 0.916i0.005 mPa—s. This is approximately 2% lower than the value in the literature at the temperature
of 250C, but almost exactly the value at 240C. The cause of the discrepancy could be the accuracy of the
hotplate’s external thermal probe, since thermocouples are known to give the correct absolute temperature
to only about iloC (even if they can measure relative temperatures far more accurately). This limits the
accuracy, in general, of all measurements on this system to about i1%.
C. Solvent index of refraction
A drop of solvent was placed in a standard refractometer, and its index of refraction was measured at 22.2OC
to be ns : 1.511. As a calibration Check on the refractometer, we also measure the value of water (18 MS)
deionized H20 from the Millipore ﬁltration system) at 22.2OC and found it to be nw : 1.333, in agreement
with the literature value.
D. Colloid Radius
We determine the colloid radius a by using dynamic light scattering to measure the diffusion constant DC
from a dilute dispersion of colloidal spheres, from which a radius is determined following the Stokes—Einstein
relation:

DC : kB—T (74)

Gwnsa
where kBT is the thermal energy, and 775 is the solvent Viscosity measured above. We follow the method for
determining DC from dynamic light scattering (DLS)2 described in.5 The intensity—intensity autocorrelation

make the gel, Cluster and ﬂuid samples for confocal imaging presented in.9*11 The particles are synthesized
in dodecane, and are then then washed several times in Cis—decahydronaphthalene (CDHN), to replace the
dodecane. The typical washing procedure begins by centrifuging the particles until they are Close—packeol at
the bottom of the Vial, so that the Vial can be inverted Without any mixing of the particles (typically, a Vial
must be centrifuged at 30009 for several hours). Then, the solvent is decanted, either by pouring or pipetting,
the inverted on a Kimwipe for several minutes to Wick away any excess solvent. Fresh solvent (in this case,
CDHN) is then added to the Close—packeol particles, in a quantity approximately 5>< to 10>< the mass of the
colloid, to the Vial. The sample is then vortexeol vigorously until until all particles are suspended back in the
solvent, and there are no macroscopic clumps, typically requiring half an hour at maximum vortexer speed
for these particles. Then the Vial is centrifuged, and the process is repeated. Each washing cycle replaces
about 90% of the solvent, so Within a few washing cycles, any original solvent should be completely replaced.

After the dodecane has been washed out and replaced by decalin, an abundance of tetrahydronaphthalene
(THN) is added (i.e. much more than the 55% dictated by the ﬁnal mass ratio). The THN—rich solvent
and particles are then heat—shockeol by placing the Vial in an oven at 800C. This swells the particles a bit
because THN is rich in conjugated bonds, and therefore a better solvent for PMMA, With its high density of
aromatics, than the entirely—alkyl CDHN. The Vial turns Clear in the oven, demonstrating an improvement
to the index match, but become mores Cloudy as the sample cools.

The next step is to centrifuge sample and decant the solvent, Which due to selective absorption of THN
now has an unknown ratio of THN to CDHN. Correcting this problem, thereby suspending the heat—shockeol
particles into a solvent of known ratio, involves repeated washings With a stock solution, made separately,
Where the 55:45 THNzoDHN is typically correct to one part in 104. After the multiple washings, the colloid
is stable and suspended in an indeX—matching ﬂuid. At this stage, Close—packeol particles concentrated by
centrifugation Will be transparent (and therefore single—scattering) through several centimeters of suspension.

After the ﬁnal redispersal With vortexing, dry polymer is added to the Vial With the particle suspension.
The Vial is then sealed and tumbled for at least 24 hours, With one 900 rotation about the long axis of the
Vial (perpendicular to the tumbler rotation axis) in the middle of the tumbling run. This ensures that all
parts of the Vial are evenly mixed. Different samples are then made by diluting this colloid—polymer stock
solution mixture With the same 55:45 solvent batch used earlier, guaranteeing a constant ratio of colloid to

IV. Speciﬁc Astronaut Innovations

This experiment simply would not have been possible without the continual improvement to the pro—
cedures by the astronauts performing the experiment. Mike Foale performed the ﬁrst set of experiments
in 2004, photographing the samples with a MagLite ﬂashlight. Mike Finoke and Leroy Chiao continually
improved the focus and illumination in successive increments. A major innovation came by using Earth—
KAM to photograph samples in an automated fashion, an idea suggested and implemented by Brion Au in
Houston. Bill McArthur was the ﬁrst to use this new system, and was able to capture the time evolution of
a single sample with hundreds of images, whereas before only handful could be acquired when shooting the
camera manually. Jeff Williams added automated time sequences from several more samples, generating a
large amount of excellent image data after having only been trained during the handover by Bill MoArthur.
Bill MoArthur and Mike Fincke also suggested removing the setup from the MWA, and instead Clamping it
to rails in areas of 188 with less trafﬁc. Dan Tani was able to use these new setups to achieve unprecedented
spatial stability in the image sequences for BCATB. Peggy Whitson was also able to free several stuck mag—
nets in the sample Chambers, enabling imaging of several BCAT3 samples. Greg Chamitoff and (actually
during the time of the writing of this conference proceeding) Sandy Magnus are acquiring new data from
BCAT4, using all of the innovations developed during BCATB.

Clearly, this continual improvement in data quality and quantity is only possible with a manned space
laboratory. We are able to collect images of the time evolution of our samples with far greater precision,
quality and quantity than we ever thought possible before launch, due primarily to the hard work, dedication,
and skill of the above astronauts, and the tremendous support and coordination throughout the NASA
organization and its contractors.

We are deeply indebted to a number of people throughout the NASA organization for making this exper—
iment possible, and in particular their responsiveness to myriad suggestions and Changes made throughout
the course of the experiment. The material in the section describing phase separation is largely based on
conversations with David Nelson, who explained everything about spinoolal decomposition to us.
