Dissolved gas due to the varying surface tension force along the liquid—vapor interface, it is shown that this variation is
very small and the resulting capillary ﬂow has only a second order effect on the ﬂow ﬁeld. Numerical sim—

The results of the experiments conﬁrmed that single bubbles did not depart and remained in contact with
the surface independent of system parameters.

As seen in Fig. 13, for a period of about 50 5 during the experi—
_ AT. = 1°C ment, the bubble equivalent diameter remained approximately
1 cm '5° constant at 13 mm. This is clue to the fact that, as a bubble grows
in subcooled liquid, an increasing portion of the bubble interface
comes in contact with the subcooled liquid. This increases the con—
densation rate which decreases the bubble growth rate. Wu and
Dhir [17] have shown that, for certain subcooled nucleate pool
boiling conditions, a bubble may grow until the point when con—
densation balances evaporation. Under these conditions the bubble
remains attached to the wall indeﬁnitely. A similar situation is
encountered in the present case, where evaporation is balanced
by condensation during the early stages of bubble growth
A (<70 5). Beyond 70 5, clue to changing system pressure that leads
“ to increased wall superheat and reduced liquid subcooling, evapo—
ration exceeds condensation and the bubble begins to grow again.
i I Fig. 14(a) shows, on an expanded scale, the ﬁrst 100 s of experi—
L 4 mental and simulated bubble growth histories. The ﬂat portion in
(a) which the bubble equivalent diameter remains constant can be
seen clearly in both the experimental data and the results obtained
from the species—conserving simulation. Fig. 14(b) shows the net
