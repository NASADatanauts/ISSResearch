the 92—day SMM—06 Shuttle—tO—Mir mission 06 (STS—84, 1997). At the onset of the mission, embryos had reached the developmental stages
25—28. For the recordings after landing, tadpoles were grouped according to the development of tail lordosis (L, ﬁlled circles) or normally
developed tails (N, Open circles). rVOR amplitude = maximal angular roll of the eyes during a 360° lateral body roll. MM, tadpoles that were
exposed to microgravity throughout the 92—day mission; CM, tadpoles exposed to in—ﬂight lg—simulation for the ﬁrst 4 days (93 h) and thereafter
to microgravity until the end of the mission; MC, tadpoles exposed to microgravity for the ﬁrst 4 days (93 h) and thereafter to in—ﬂight lg—
simulation until deactivation of the centrifuge, 12 h before the end of the mission; CC, tadpoles exposed to microgravity throughout the 9—day
mission except the time between launch and activation of the centrifuge and after deactivation of the lg—centrifuge; GG, tadpoles from the lg—
ground control. Observation periods are deﬁned below the lowest plot; pF, days after fertilization; post—LD, days after landing of the spacecraft.
Each ﬁlled and Open circle represents an individual animal. Numbers at the bottom of each plot give the numbers of tadpoles; levels of statistical
