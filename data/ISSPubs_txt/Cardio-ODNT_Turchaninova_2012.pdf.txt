Abstract—The age—speciﬁc indicators of the functions of the cardiovascular system and its responses to the
lower body negative pressure (LBNP) test were studied in career cosmonauts for the ﬁrst time. The results of
174 LBNP tests implemented within the standard medical monitoring program on board the “Mir” orbital
station (OS “Mir”), using a Garnrna—Ol device, and aboard the International Space Station (188), using the
Garnrna—lM complex, were subjected to comparative analysis. In total, 38 cosmonauts from 25 long-dura-
tion space missions on board the “Mir” OS and ISS, who were examined in their pre-ﬂight state and during
in—ﬂight periods, beginning, typically, on ﬂight day (FD) 120, were subdivided into two age groups: 30- to
39—year-olds (their mean age was 36 i 0.7 years; 39% 0f the total number of subjects) and 40- to 55-year olds
(their mean age was 46 i 0.8 years; 61% of the total number of subjects). We have revealed age-speciﬁc indi-
cators for the hemodynamic status recorded at each stage of the investigation: at rest in a preﬂight state;
responses of the indicators to the effects of microgravity; the relative dynamics of the indicators due to a sim-
ulated orthostatic posture, which was unidirectional but substantially different at the pre-and in-ﬂight stages.
For purposes of medical control, our results have shown that we need to establish age-speciﬁc references in
our methodical approaches to the analysis and interpretation of the data received from monitoring cosmo-
nauts’ health in their preﬂight state and during the entire mission and, Which is particularly important in prac-
tical terms, when evaluating the LBNP test intolerance at different ﬂight stages.
