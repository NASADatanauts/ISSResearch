0 Premise 0f the study: Gravity has been a major force throughout the evolution of terrestrial organisms, and plants have devel—
oped exquisitely sensitive, regulated tropisms and growth patterns that are based on the gravity vector. The nulliﬁed gravity
during spaceﬂight allows direct assessment of gravity roles. The microgravity environments provided by the Space Shuttle and
International Space Station have made it possible to seek novel insights into gravity perception at the organismal, tissue, and
cellular levels. Cell cultures of Arabidopsis thaliana perceive and respond to spaceﬂight, even though they lack the specialized
cell structures normally associated with gravity perception in intact plants; in particular, genes for a speciﬁc subset of heat
shock proteins (HSPs) and factors (HSFs) are induced. Here we ask if similar Changes in HSP gene expression occur during
nonspaceﬂight Changes in gravity stimulation.

0 Methods: Quantitative RT—qPCR was used to evaluate mRNA levels for Hsp] 7. 6A and Hsp] 01 in cell cultures exposed to four
conditions: spaceﬂight (mission STS—131), hypergraVity (centrifugation at 3 g or 16 g), sustained two—dimensional Clinorota—
tion, and transient milligraVity achieved on parabolic ﬂights.

0 Key results: We showed that HSP genes were induced in cells only in response to sustained Clinorotation. Transient micrograv—
ity intervals in parabolic ﬂight and various hypergraVity conditions failed to induce HSP genes.

0 Conclusions: We conclude that nondifferentiated cells do indeed sense their gravity environment and HSP genes are induced
only in response to prolonged microgravity or simulated microgravity conditions. We hypothesize that HSP induction upon
microgravity indicates a role for HSP—related proteins in maintaining cytoskeletal architecture and cell shape signaling.

Key words: Arabidopsis thaliana; Brassicaceae; gravity; heat shock proteins; HSP gene expression; nonndifferentiated cells;

Expen'ments in fundamental space biology seek answers to level. Since spaceﬂight elicits profound molecular reactions in cell

study how gravity is perceived and processed as a developmental proach helps us to better understand the distinction of the molecu—
