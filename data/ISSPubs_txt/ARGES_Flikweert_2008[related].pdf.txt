Abstract
The metal—halide (MH) lamp shows an unwanted non—uniform distribution of the metal
additive (Dy in our case), caused by convection and diffusion phenomena. MH lamps with
various Hg pressures and burner lengths have been investigated by imaging laser absorption
spectroscopy under varying gravity conditions in a centrifuge (1—10g). 2D ground state Dy
density proﬁles have been determined. From these images, the density inhomogeneity and
corrected aXial segregation parameters are obtained. The proﬁles and parameters are affected
by the aXial temperature gradient, which is more pronounced for higher Hg pressures and
shorter burner lengths.
