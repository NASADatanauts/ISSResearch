in the upper and lower parts of the lamina (Mullen 6t 4].,
2006). However, the overall basic physiological processes are
often assumed to be essentially the same: ion transport into
relevant structures is accompanied by electrical events, osmotic
changes, turgor—driven water transport and volume changes
that ﬁnally manifest themselves in observable movements of
the leaves. Potassium and proton transport plays a fundamental
role (Moran, 2007).
