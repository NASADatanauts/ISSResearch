after intramuscular autotransplantation, the scales were removed and cut into half. After pre—incubation with a PTH—free culture medium for 6 h, one half of the scale was cultured for
24 and 48 h with fugu PTH1 (10 ng/ml) and then ﬁxed and stained for TRAP. The other half was cultured for 24 and 48 h without fugu PTH1 and then ﬁxed and stained for TRAP. After

the formation and activity of multinucleated osteoclasts [27]. In In the present study, we cloned both PTH1R and PTHZR cDNAs
mammals, PTH1R is located in the osteoblast lineage and increases from the goldﬁsh scales and found a greater abundance of PTH1Rthan
osteoclastic formation and activity via the RANK—RANKL pathway PTHZR. A ligand of PTHZR is a tuberoinfundibular peptide (TIP)
[27—29]. Our present data demonstrates that fugu PTH1 can increase isolated from bovine hypothalamus [42,43]. As both TIP and PTHZR

The increased RANKL mRNA in response to PTH treatment in scales TIP acts on the nervous system in mammals [43,44]. In tilapia,
(Fig. 5) most likely reﬂects an action of PTH on the osteoblasts of
scales whereas the increased RANK production is the result of
increased osteoclast generation, as conﬁrmed in Figs 6—9. Since (A) TRAP
PTH1R is mainly expressed in the scale, this hormone seems likely to , C, I '\
