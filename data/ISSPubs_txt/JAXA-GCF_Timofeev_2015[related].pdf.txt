Abstract—Enzymes 0f the phosphoribosyl pyrophosphate synthetase family (PRPPS, EC 2.7.6.1) catalyze
the formation of 5—ph0sph0rib0sy1 pyrophosphate (5—PRPP) from adenosine triphosphate and ribose
5—ph0sphate. 5—Ph0sph0rib0sy1 pyrophosphate is an important intermediate in the synthesis of purine,
pyrimidine, and pyridine nucleotides, as well as of the amino acids histidine and tryptophan. The crystalli—
zation conditions for E. coli PRPPS were found by the vapor—diffusion technique and were optimized to apply
the capillary counter—diffusion technique. The X—ray diffraction data set was collected from the crystals
grown by the counter— diffusion technique using a synchrotron radiation source to 3.1—A resolution. The crys—
tals 0f PRPPS belong to sp. gr. P6322 and have the following unit—ce11 parameters: a = b = 104.44 A, c =
124.98 A, 0: = [3 = 900, y = 1200. The collected X—ray diffraction data set is suitable for the solution of the

three—dimensional structure of PRPPS at 31—131 resolution.
