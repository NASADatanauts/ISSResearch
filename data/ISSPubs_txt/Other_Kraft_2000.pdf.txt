an aXis or, in some cases, three dimensions. A variety
of elinostats have been utilized to study plant growth
and development as well as to answer basic questions
about sensory physiology. These elinostats can be
divided into three types: (i) one-aXis slow-rotating

(50—120 rpm) elinostats; and (iii) two-aXis or three-
