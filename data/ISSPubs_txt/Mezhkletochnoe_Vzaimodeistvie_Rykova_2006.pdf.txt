Abstract—Serum levels of immunoglobulins G, A, M, and E (IgG, IgA, IgM, and IgE, respectively); allergen—
speciﬁc IgE antibodies; and interleukin—4 (IL—4) were measured in ten cosmonauts before and after ﬂights of
7—11 days on the International Space Station. These relatively short spaceﬂights did not cause any signiﬁcant
Changes in the parameters tested. No linear correlation was found between the serum levels of total IgE and IL—4

for either the pre— or the postﬂight period.
