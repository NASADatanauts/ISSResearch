The Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency developed the mouse Habitat Cage
Unit (HCU) for installation in the Cell Biology Experiment Facility (CBEF)
onboard the Japanese Experimental Module (”Kibo”) 0n the International Space
Station. The CBEF provides ”space-based controls” by generating artificial
gravity in the HCU through a centrifuge, enabling a comparison of the
biological consequences of microgravity and artificial gravity of 1 g on mice
housed in space. Therefore, prior to the space experiment, a ground-based
study to validate the habitability 0f the HCU is necessary to conduct space
experiments using the HCU in the CBEF. Here, we investigated the
ground-based effect of a 32-day housing period in the HCU breadboard model
on male mice in comparison With the control cage mice. Morphology of skeletal
muscle, the thymus, heart, and kidney, and the sperm function showed no
critical abnormalities between the control mice and HCU mice. Slight but
significant changes caused by the HCU itself were observed, including
decreased body weight, increased weights of the thymus and gastrocnemius,
reduced thickness of cortical bone of the femur, and several gene expressions
from 11 tissues. Results suggest that the HCU provides acceptable conditions
for mouse phenotypic analysis using CBEF in space, as long as its characteristic
features are considered. Thus, the HCU is a feasible device for future space
experiments.

"7","Introduction

As sensing and adapting to a changing environment is key for any organism’s
survival, the constant mechanical stimulus of gravity is the one prominent
factor that most organisms on Earth have shared through evolution. In order
to elucidate how mammals respond to gravity, outer space experiments
utilizing mice are among the most essential studies, and require specialized
habitats applicable to the space environment. Historically, the Animal
Enclosure Module (AEM) had flown since its maiden flight in 1983, carrying
mice and rats on over 20 Space Shuttle missions [15]. The biosatellites,
launching animals into the orbit and returning to Earth since 1957, cannot be
overseen for their contribution to space science, advancing to the recent Russian
Bion-Ml [21]. Today, the Japanese Experimental Module (“Kibo”) onboard
the International Space Station (188) is in the spotlight, as this laboratory
allows longer-term space study due to its permanently functioning capability.
Research utilizing Kibo began in 2008, with the Italian Mice Drawer System
being used successfully in a mouse space study [2]. Such studies have brought
valuable insights about the spaceflight effects on mice; however, one drawback
in such studies comparing space-housed mice to ground-housed mice limits the
borders regarding gravitational biology. As various conditions differ between
the ground and space environments including cosmic radiation, microbial
environment, and lack of convection, setting ground-housed mice as a control
group prevents clear identification of the microgravity impacts on such mice.

6

"
"8","As a solution, the Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency (JAXA) developed the
Cell Biology Experiment Facility (CBEF) [30], equipped with sections providing
microgravity and artificial gravity of 1 g. The artificial gravity of 1 g generated
by a short-arm centrifuge enables space-based control, where all conditions are
equalized apart from the gravitational difference. To date, the CBEF has housed
numerous organisms including cell lines, nematode, aquatic organisms, and
plants, but not mice. In this study, we developed the mouse Habitat Cage Unit
(HCU) for installation in the CBEF. By utilizing HCU cages for all variable
gravity conditions, including microgravity, artificial gravity of 1 g generated by
CBEF in space, and ground-based 1 g, it defines the impacts of microgravity
and the space environment for future studies. Although there have been
concerns over the large Coriolis force and gravitational gradient inside the cage
generated by the short-arm centrifuge 0f CBEF, we recently reported that both
concerns cause no biological consequences on mice [17]. In order to proceed
with further mouse studies in space, the Characterization of the HCU must be
carefully defined by comparing with control cages at ground level, as a
non-standard habitat may affect mice regardless of gravitational differences,
like the AEM [16]. Therefore, prior to the space experiments, molecular,
histological, and physiological examinations of the whole body of mice were
conducted to evaluate HCU habitability.

Animals. Mice were maintained under specific pathogen-free conditions in a
Laboratory Animal Resource Center at the University of Tsukuba. All
experiments were approved by the institutional animal care and use
committees of the University of Tsukuba (NO. 14-235) and JAXA (JAXA IACUC
protocol No. 014-008), and conducted according to related guidelines and
applicable laws in Japan. Seven-week 01d C57BL / 6] male mice were purchased
from Charles River Laboratories International, Inc. (Japan). They were
acclimatized to the environment for one week in HEPA filtered disposable
cages (Inocage; Oriental Giken, Tokyo, Japan). Six mice were individually
transported and housed in the HCUS for 32 days. Six other control mice
remained in the Inocages as the control group. Table 1 summarizes the
comparison between control cages and the HCUS. The floor area and volume of
the cage area in the HCU (101 cm2, 560 cm3) is smaller than that of the control
cage (Inocage, 552 cm2, 7,256 cm3). The floor area and volume of the cages were
designed according to the Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals
(National Research Council 2011), having been approved by the institutions
concerned, including the University of Tsukuba and JAXA. Approval from the
National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) must be obtained for
further references and processes. The bedding material consisted of paper Chips
(ALPHA-DRI; Shepherd Specialty Papers Inc., Watertown, MA, USA) in the

8

"
"10","control cages, but was not used in the HCU. As in the conventional mouse
cages, the internal materials of the walls and floor of the HCU are made of
polycarbonate. Almost all internal parts of HCU can be dismounted and
sterilized by using an autoclave 0r ethylene oxide gas. Both control cages and
HCUs were placed in an air-conditioned room (average temperature; 241°C,
average relative humidity; 42.8%RH) with a 12:12—h light-dark cycle. The
average temperature inside the HCU was 257°C and average relative humidity
was 41.3% RH. Airflow by fan (0.2 m/sec.) was always supplied inside the
HCU for maintaining the same conditions as in the actual space experiment.
The mice were fed CRF-l (Oriental Yeast Co., Ltd., Tokyo, Japan) and given
water ad libitum. The drinking water was autoclaved tap water containing
iodine (0.2 mg/ 1). Feeder cartridges and water bottles were replaced once a
week, and cage refreshing was not done in the HCU. After both mouse groups
were housed for 32 days, we Checked the health condition of the mice and
measured their body weights. Motor function was estimated using the rotarod
test (47600, Bioresearch Center, Nagoya, Japan) as previously described [17]. All
mice were euthanized by inhaling lethal doses of isoflurane, and then subjected
to dissection for collecting tissue samples.

Hematologic analysis of peripheral blood. Peripheral blood samples were
collected from the inferior vena cava 0f anesthetized mice by using a syringe
containing EDTA-ZK solution. Blood count was determined with an automated

9

"
"11","hemocytometer (Nihon Kohden, Tokyo, Japan). Blood samples were smeared
onto microscope slides and stained with May-Griinwald-Giemsa stain, and then
photographed with a BIOREVO BZ-9000 microscope (Keyence, Osaka, Japan).
Immunohistochemistry. Immunohistochemical analysis on the thymus [1],
heart, kidney [9], and skeletal muscle [11] was conducted as previously
described. Supplementary Table 1 lists the primary antibodies used. The heart
muscle sections were stained with Phalloidin—TRITC (Sigma, St. Louis, MO,
USA). Immunodetection was performed using Alexa Fluor conjugated
secondary antibodies (Molecular Probes). These sections were observed with a
BIOREVO BZ-9000 microscope (Keyence). The numbers of immunoreactive
muscle fiber and cross-sectional areas were measured using Dynamic Cell
Count BZ-HlC software (Keyence).

Enzyme-Linked ImmunoSorbent Assay (ELISA). ELISA assays were
performed as previously described with some modifications [19]. In brief,
flat-bottom 96-well plates (NUNC) were coated with rat anti-mouse IgM, IgGl,
IgG3 and IgA antibodies (Southern Biotechnology, Birmingham, AL, USA) and
blocked with 3% BSA in PBS. To generate standard curves, isotype-specific
affinity-purified mouse antibodies (Southern Biotechnology) were used. Serially
diluted standards and plasma samples were then loaded to assigned wells, and
then incubated for 1 h at room temperature. Bound antibodies were detected by

"12","HRP-Conjugated goat anti-mouse isotype-specific antibodies (Southern
Biotechnology), followed by the addition of SureBlueTM TMB Microwell
Peroxidase Substrate (KPL, Gaithersburg, MD, USA). Absorbance at 450 nm
was measured using an iMark microplate reader (BioRad, Hercules, CA, USA).
Quantitative RT-PCR. Total RNAs were isolated from various adult mice
using the RNeasy Mini Kit (QIAGEN, Venlo, Netherlands) 0r ISOGEN solution
(Nippon Gene, Tokyo, Japan), and CDNA templates were synthesized from the
total RNA with the QuantiTect Reverse Transcription Kit (QIAGEN). PCR was
carried out using the TP850 Thermal Cycler Dice Real Time System (Takara,
Shiga, Japan) with SYBR Premix Ex Taq II (Takara). Supplementary Table 5 lists
the primer sequences. The relative amount of each gene was normalized to the
amount of the Gapdh, Hprt, or 179;? transcript in the same CDNA.
MicroCT analysis. After skeletal muscles were carefully removed from the
mouse hind limbs, femurs were fixed in 70% ethanol and subjected to
microcomputed tomography (microCT) analysis as previously described [24].
MicroCT scanning was performed using a ScanXmate-AlOOS Scanner
(Comscantechno, Yokohama, Japan), and the three-dimensional microstructure
of the metaphysical region in the femur was analyzed using TRI/3D-BON
software (RATOC, Tokyo, Japan).

"13","Sperm motility. Spermatozoa collected from cauda epididyms were frozen as
previously described [27]. After thawing, spermatozoa were dispersed into
TYH in Vitro fertilization medium and sperm motility was observed under a
phase contrast microscope. Sperm parameters were measured with a
computer-assisted sperm analysis system (CEROS—II; Hamilton Thorne, Beverly,
MA, USA) as per the manufacturer's instructions.

Statistical analysis. Statistical analyses were conducted using the F-test
followed by an unpaired Student’s t test or Welch’s test. P values are provided

"14","Results and Discussion
The IAXA mouse Habitat Cage Unit (HCU)

Mice are scheduled to stay in the HCU on Kibo for a few months and then
return to Earth alive. In order to conduct a comparison experiment entailing
microgravity and artificial gravity of 1 g, the HCU is shaped in a hollow
cylinder section to be installed in the CBEF (Fig. 1 A, B). The microgravity and
artificial gravity of 1 g sections each contain six HCUs. The HCU is designed for
individual housing, thus offering a great advantage in enabling the housing of
male mice in space. In previous studies, mouse habitat units were designed for
group housing, restricting them to female mice experiments, as the group
housing of male mice induces fight responses. In order to continuously monitor
each condition, the HCU is composed of a cage equipped With a C02 sensor,
NH3 sensor, and a temperature/humidity sensor. To Visually check the health
condition of mice and the cage conditions, cameras are installed in each HCU
cage for the continuous monitoring and recording of mice behavior during the
entire 32-day period (Fig. 1 C, E). A fully operational self—feeder unit,
waste-Collecting equipment, two self—watering units (A1400; Edstrom Japan,
Tokyo, Japan), and a ventilation fan were also installed and are functional at
any given time. For all disposals into the waste-Collecting equipment, many
circular holes (5 mm in diameter, Fig. 1 C) are left open in a regular fashion at
the bottom of the HCU cage, With the assistance of a ventilation fan having a

13

"
"15","regulated noise level 0f 60 dB. The intensity of the periodically functioning LED
lights built into the HCU is approximately 50 lux. The CRF-l food bars loaded
in the self-feeder unit with stainless guard bars (1 mm in diameter, Fig. 1 D)
provide food when needed. While containing the same ingredients, the food bar
is larger than the standard CRF-l pellet. These features allow minimum effort
to constantly provide food, as ample food sources will be orderly supplied as
the food is consumed. In order to confirm the possibility of contaminated
drinking water, bacterial cultures for Psedomonas aeruginosa tests were
performed using water remaining in the bottles, resulting in negative for the
HCU group (data not shown). The average room temperature and average
room relative humidity during the experiment were 241°C and 42.8%RH,
respectively. The average temperature inside the HCU was 257°C. The
habitation environment appeared to be suitable for mouse health throughout
the experiment.
Body weight, water intake, food intake, and rotarod test

As the HCU has been designed with distinct features applicable to space
experiments, a range of differences were observed in the HCU-housed mice
(HCU mice) as compared to the c0ntrol-cage-housed mice (control mice). While
the HCU mice looked the same in appearance as the control mice by day 32, the
body weights of the HCU mice were slightly but significantly lower than those
of the control mice (Fig. 1 F; 27.2 i 0.3 g in the control group vs. 24.5 i 0.3 g in

14

"
"16","the HCU group). This weight loss could be a consequence of the dramatic
reduction seen during the first seven days of the experiment, as the growth rate
frequency of mice did not alter between the control mice and the HCU mice
after seven days. When the weight loss was observed in the HCU mice, food
intake showed no significant difference compared to control mice (Fig. 1 H).
These results suggest that habitual changes, including cage size, position of
water nozzles, airflow by fan, loss of bedding materials, and especially the
difficulty in adapting to unusually large-sized food, may have caused a
transient weight reduction amongst the HCU mice during the first seven days.
This is exemplified by the steady growth rate frequency of the HCU mice
matching that of control mice for the remaining 25 days after adaptation to the
changing environment (Fig. 1F). This suggests that the habitual changes
induced by the HCU do not cause sustained stress to mice, and that the mice
can be acclimated to the HCU Within seven days of habituation. Over the 25
days after adaptation, food intake was less than that of the control mice, though
meeting the control values during the last five days. The smaller cage size may
be suspected, since the range in cage size could be correlating to changes in
physical movement of the HCU mice. However, the relationship between the
weight increase rate and food intake remains unknown. The habituation of
mice given the CRF-l food bars several days prior to launch, may eliminate the
weight loss effect for future space studies. Water intake was significantly
excessive among the HCU mice throughout the Whole period of investigation
15

"
"17","(Fig. 1 G). C57BL/ 6] male mice in smaller cages were previously shown to
consume or waste more food and water than mice housed in larger cages [6],
Which is consistent With higher water consumption by the HCU mice. In
addition, the restricted volume of the HCU was thought to attract the mice
toward the water nozzles, leading to water wastage mistaken as water intake.
We then conducted the rotarod test to evaluate Whether the HCU impairs
motor function capability. The duration time of HCU mice on the rod decreased,
though not significantly as compared With that of the control mice (Fig. 1 1).
Organ weight, blood indices and immunoglobulin levels
For the effects of body weight reduction of the HCU mice, we measured organ
weight and normalized it With body weight. The HCU mice showed no
differences in relative spleen, heart, kidney, liver, epididymal fat, inguinal fat,
mesenteric fat, testis and epididymis weights, excluding a slight increase in
relative thymus weight (Supplementary Table 2). Thymic size is susceptible to
various stressors [8]. Normally, stressors cause thymic involution, Which is the
opposite case found in this study Where that the HCU mice did not receive
excess stress. Certain environmental factors of the HCU may have induced
thymic enlargement, though the clear mechanism remains unknown.
All blood indices in the HCU group fell Within the normal range, although
platelet count decreased slightly but significantly (Supplementary Table 3).
Plasma immunoglobulin levels did not differ between the two groups
16

"
"18","(Supplementary Table 4). Although the clear mechanism remains to be solved,
these results suggest that the HCU causes a slight change on the platelet count,
and at least it shows that the HCU is not a stressful environment for housing
mice, as platelets are not a sensitive indicator of stress [5].

Histological analysis of thymus, heart and kidney

The weight of the thymus in rodents has reportedly decreased [7, 20] or
remained unchanged [3] in space experiments. Although the thymus weight
among the HCU mice increased, there was no difference in Keratin—S and
Keratin—8 positive epithelial cells of thymi between the HCU mice and the
control mice (Fig. 2). The degree of epithelial morphology revealed no change
in the HCU mice. To evaluate the effect of housing in the HCU on tissue
structure, histological analyses of the heart and kidney were examined. Cardiac
hypertrophy and fibrosis were not observed in the heart from the HCU mice
and control mice (data not shown). In the heart, connexin43, the main gap
junction protein important for cardiomyocyte function, was predominantly
expressed in the sarcolernma. It has been reported that, in failing hearts, total
connexin43 expression and its localization at gap junctions were reduced [13].
In this study, immunohistochemical analysis revealed no differences in
connexin43 expression and localization in the heart of the HCU mice and
control mice (Fig. 2). We then investigated kidney morphology, where no
histological damage (including tissue injury or fibrosis) was confirmed in both
groups (data not shown). In kidney disease patients, the expression of nephrin,

17

"
"19","a renal glomerulus-specific cell adhesion receptor, is known to be lowered and
its localization altered. Therefore, we performed the immunostaining of
nephrin and CD34, a vascular endothelial marker, in the kidney glomerulus.
The expression levels of nephrin and CD34 in the HCU mice did not differ from
those in the control mice (Fig. 2). These results suggest that HCU housing has
little effect in Changing the tissue structure of the heart and kidney.
Characterization ofhindlimb muscles

Skeletal muscle is a classical organ susceptible to gravity, leading to
pathogenesis including muscle atrophy. One of the main subjects of mouse
space study is therefore to define the mechanism of such condition to prevent
muscle atrophy of astronauts unloading from spaceflight, where analysis of
muscle behavior in space is necessary [21, 23]. Examination to assess the
usefulness of the HCU on muscle study showed that the gastrocnemius weight
in the HCU mice were slightly but significantly increased relative to the control
group (Fig. 3 A). The weights of four other hindlimb skeletal muscles in the
HCU mice were normal compared to the control mice. To elucidate the
mechanism of gastrocnemius muscle hypertrophy in the HCU mice, fiber-type
transitions and more cross-sectional areas (CSA) were verified by
immunohistochemical analysis. Fiber-type-specific antibodies (BA-DS, SC-71
and BF-F3) were used for staining, with immune reactive fibers being counted
(Fig. 3 B). The lack of differences in fiber compositions between the mice groups

18

"
"20","suggests n0 occurrence of fiber-type transitions (Fig. 3 C). The frequency
distribution of CSAs from the staining of gastrocnemius muscle fiber With the
anti-laminin 0L2 antibody was plotted (Fig. 3 D). Plotting the CSAs revealed a
slight but insignificant increase of Whole fiber CSA distributions of the HCU
mice as compared With those of the control mice. To determine the relation
between gene expression and muscle hypertrophy, we performed RT-PCR to
quantify transcripts in the gastrocnemius, soleus, and tibialis anterior muscles
(Fig. 3 E). Insulin—like growth factor 1 (Igf—l) is the protein growth factor that
promotes protein synthesis and subsequent skeletal muscle hypertrophy [4].
Trim63/Murf-1 and Fbxo32/Atrogin-1 are muscle-specific atrophy-related
ubiquitin ligases responsible for increased protein degradation through the
ubiquitin-proteasome system [29]. The expression of Igf-l in the gastrocnemius
muscle significantly increased in the HCU mice, but not in the other two
muscles. The levels of Trim63/Murf-1 and FbxoSZ/Atrogin-l transcripts in the
HCU mice were similar to those of the control mice in all three muscles. It is
hypothesized that the increase in I gf-l expression affected the small increase in
gastrocnemius weight, Where the precise mechanism is only speculated, such as
changes in the posture of HCU mice. These results demonstrated that changes
in gastrocnemius characteristics must be considered for future studies.
Microstructuml analysis of bone

Bone homeostasis is regulated by many external systems as well as the

19

"
"21","endocrine, immune, and central nervous systems. It has been well known that
mechanical unloading such as microgravity and bed rest results in bone loss,
Which leads to changes in calcium homeostasis [26]. Bone loss during
spaceflight is a serious problem in astromedicine, essentially requiring the
development of strategies to protect bone tissues. Thus, it is very important to
understand the mechanisms by Which microgravity induces bone loss. In this
study, the bone mass and structure of the femur—one 0f the bones most
susceptible to microgravity—was evaluated based on microcomputed
tomography (microCT) analysis. The bone volume and structures in trabecular
bone did not change between the control mice and HCU mice. The bone
mineral content in the HCU mice was also normal compared to the control mice.
In contrast, the thickness and sectional area of cortical bone in the HCU group
were significantly reduced (-4.6% and -8.9%, respectively) due to decreased
external line length (-5.1%), Which is apparently attributed to a single housing
in a narrow space [18]. Although the bone loss observed in the HCU group is
slight compared to that of the mechanical unloading model [25] the cortical
bone of the HCU mice should be carefully evaluated.
Male reproductive system

Many studies have reported on the effect of weightlessness on the
reproductive system using ground-based low gravity experiments. For example,
the hindlimb suspension test on rodents caused reductions in testicular weight

20

"
"22","and sperm motility [12, 28]. It is very important to produce and evaluate the
next generations from mice housed in space. In this study, the weight of the
testis and epididymis showed no difference between the control mice and HCU
mice (Supplementary Table 2). In order to assess the effect of HCU housing on
sperm motility, sperm in the epididymis was collected and stored in liquid
nitrogen, so that sperm motility and velocity could be evaluated later by using
the frozen—thawed sperm. Sperm morphology, motility, and velocity showed no
difference between the control mice and HCU mice (data not shown, Fig. 5).
These findings suggest that housing mice in the HCU does not affect the male
reproductive function.
Gene expression pattern

A mouse genome-Wide transcriptional profiling study is planned for the
future. Therefore, the transcription abnormalities caused by housing conditions
in the HCU should be minimized. The expression of 51 transcripts in ten organs
was comprehensively measured by quantitative RT-PCR and summarized in
Table 2, except for that of skeletal muscle. Brain—derived neurotrophic factor
(BDNF) is linked to various aspects of synaptic plasticity, including the
stress-induced plasticity of amygdala. GRIA1 is a subunit of the AMPA
receptor (an ionotropic glutamate receptor) and involved in synaptic plasticity
[14]. The expression of Bdnf in amygdara and Grial in the striatum and
cerebellar vermis was unchanged in the HCU mice. In two endocrine organs

21

"
"23","including the pituitary gland and adrenal gland, the expression level of most
genes did not change except for the Calca gene in the thyroid gland.
Calca might be upregulated by the reduction of bone mass to maintain the
homeostasis of the blood calcium level. Expression of stress responsive genes,
(Pomp in pituitary gland, Cypl 1511, Cyplle, and Cyp17a1 in adrenal gland [10])
showed no change in the HCU mice, indicating that the HCU did not cause
stress to housing mice. While no change was observed in White adipose tissue,
the expression of thermogenesis—related genes (Dio-Z, chl-a, and UCp-l) was
statistically decreased in brown adipose tissue of the HCU mice. As the increase
in expression of thermogenesis—related genes in response to exercise is a
well-known theory [22] the reduced physical movement of the HCU mice has
been suggested as a possible cause of the downregulation of these genes. In the
heart, the expression level of most genes related to the cytoskeleton, cardiac
injury, cardiac atrophy, and autophagy did not change much as compared to
that of the control mice. In the kidney, most of the genes related to
inflammation, fibrosis, endothelial dysfunction, regulation of the renal function,
and glomerular structure showed no significant Change. These results revealed
that most gene expression did not change or changed slightly, Which must be
carefully considered relative to using the HCU.

Space experiments using mice require specially designed habitats applicable
for the space environment, thus causing slight but diverse differences in the
conditions of housed mice. In this study, we showed that the HCU for

22

"
"24","installation in the CBEF causes no biological abnormalities on mice, though
slight but significant changes were identified in several organs. Thus, we
conclude that the HCU is applicable for future space mouse experiments using
the CBEF, but these characteristic features of the HCU must be considered,
followed by using the homologous HCU for control and sample groups, to find
the true effects of spaceflight and microgravity. The HCU installed in the CBEF
Will be Vital to permit comprehensive space experimental analysis on male mice
in the future.
