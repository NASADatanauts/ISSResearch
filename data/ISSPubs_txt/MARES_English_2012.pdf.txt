ARTICLEINFO ABSTRACT

[1‘1 Jute €122,192 2012 standardized method to document strength changes in—ﬂight has not been established.
CCEP 6 June To address this issue, a proprietary dynamometer, the Muscle Atrophy Research and
— Exercise System (MARES) has been developed and ﬂown aboard the 155. The aims of this
KeJ/WOTdSI ground—based investigation were to: (1) evaluate the test—retest reliability of MARES
Strength t6“ and (2) determine its agreement with a commercially available isokinetic dynamometer
Esssaceﬂi ht previously used for pre— and postﬂight medical testing.
Nlljicrogrgvity Methods: Six males (179.5 i 4.7 cm; 82.0 i 8.7 kg; 31.3 i 4.0 yr) and four females
Peak torque (163.2 i7.3 cm; 63.2 i 1.9 kg; 32.3 i6.8 yr) completed two testing sessions on a
In_ﬂight HUMAC NORM isokinetic dynamometer (NORM) and two sessions on MARES using a
randomized, counterbalanced, cross—over design. Peak torque values at 600 and
1800 s—1 were calculated from ﬁve maximal repetitions of knee extension (KB) and
knee ﬂexion (KF) for each session. Total work at 1800 s—1 was determined from the area
under the torque versus displacement curve during 20 maximal repetitions of KB
and KP.
Results: Intraclass correlation coefﬁcients were relatively high for both devices (0.90—0.99).
Only one dependent measure, KE peak torque at 600 s‘1 exhibited good concordance
between devices (p=0.92) and a small average difference (0.9 i 17.3 N m).
Conclusion: MARES demonstrated acceptable test—retest reliability and thus should serve
as a good tool to monitor in—ﬂight strength changes. However, due to poor agreement with
NORM, it is not advisable to compare absolute values obtained on these devices.
