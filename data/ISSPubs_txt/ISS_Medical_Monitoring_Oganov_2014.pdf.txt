Abstract—Analysis 0f the results Oflong—term investigations ofbones in cosmonauts on board Mir orbital sta—
ti0n(OS) and International Space Station (138) (n = 80) was performed. Theoretically predicted(eV01uti0n—
ary predeﬁned) change in mass of different skeleton bones was found to be correlated (r = 0.904) with the
position relative to Earth’s gravity vector. Vector dependence of bone loss results from local speciﬁcity of
expression ofbone metabolism genes, which reﬂects mechanical prehistory 0f skeleton structures in the evo—
lution of Homo erectus. Genetic polymorphism is accountable for high individual variability of bone loss,
which is attested by the dependence of bone loss rate on polymorphism of certain genetic markers of bone
metabolism. The type of the orbital vehicle did not affect the individual—speciﬁc stability of the bone loss ratio
in different segments of the skeleton. This fact is considered as a phenotype ﬁngerprint of local metabolism
in the form of a locus—speciﬁc spatial structure of distribution of non—collagen proteins responsible for posi—
tion regulation of endosteal metabolism. Drug treatment of osteoporosis (n = 107) evidences that recovery
rate depends on bone location; the most likely reason is different effectiveness of local osteotropic interven—

tion into areas ofbustling resorption.
