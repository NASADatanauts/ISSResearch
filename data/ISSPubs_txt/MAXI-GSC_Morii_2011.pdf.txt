Abstract
We report on the MAXI GSC X—ray monitoring of the Crab nebula and pulsar
during the GeV garnrna—ray ﬂare for the period of 2010 September 18—24 (MJD
55457—55463) detected by AGILE and Ferrni—LAT. There were no signiﬁcant varia—
tions on the pulse phase averaged and pulsed ﬂuxes during the garnrna—ray ﬂare on
time scales from 0.5 to 5 days. The pulse proﬁle also showed no signiﬁcant Change
during this period. The upper limits on the variations of the pulse phase averaged and
pulsed ﬂuxes for the period MJD 55457.5—55462.5 in the 4—10 keV band are derived
to be 1 and 19%, respectively, at the 90% conﬁdence limit of the statistical uncer—
tainty. The lack of variations in the pulsed component over the rnulti—wavelength
range (radio, X—ray, hard X—ray, and garnrna—ray) supports not the pulsar but the
nebular origin for the garnrna—ray ﬂare.

1. Introduction

The Crab nebula has been the standard candle in high energy X—ray and garnrna—ray
astronomy. The ﬂux and spectrum in these energy ranges have been expected to be steady over
years. Surprisingly, AGILE and Ferrni—LAT reported a ﬂare for the period of 2010 September
18—24 in the GeV garnrna—ray energy range (Tavani et a1. 2010; Buehler et a1. 2010; Tavani et
a1. 2011; Abdo et a1. 2011). The ﬁrst half of the ﬂare (September 18—21) was detected by both
AGILE and Ferrni—LAT, while that of the second half (September 21—24) was detected only
by Ferrni—LAT. The half—day binned light curve of Ferrni—LAT exhibited three sub—ﬂares during
these periods (Balbo et a1. 2011).

INTEGRAL observed the Crab nebula from 10:32 on September 12 to 12:48 on
September 19 (UT) for calibration purposes, which covered the ﬁrst ﬁfth of the garnrna—ray
ﬂare. It detected no signiﬁcant ﬂux increase in the 20—400 keV range (Ferrigno et al. 2010a).
Swift BAT detected no variations over the uncertainty of 5.5% at the 1—0 limit in the 15—50
keV range for the period of 2010 September 19—21 (Markwardt, Barthelrny & Baurngartner
2010). Radio observations of the Crab pulsar showed no evidence of a pulsar glitch and also
no Change on the pulsed ﬂux as well as the pulse proﬁle (Espinoza et a1. 2010). ARGO—YBJ
reported an excess of events (4 0) from a direction consistent with the Crab nebula, correspond—
ing to a ﬂux about 3—4 times higher than usual, at the median energy of about 1 TeV (Aielli
et a1. 2010). On the other hand, MAGIC and VERITAS reported no signiﬁcant enhancement
in the TeV garnrna—ray ﬂux during the GeV ﬂare (Mariotti et a1. 2010; Ong et a1. 2010). The

which corresponds to the third sub—ﬂare recognized in the Fermi—LAT light curve (Balbe et al.
2011), showed no Changes of ﬂux, spectrum or pulse proﬁle (Evangelista et al. 2010). Swift
XRT detected no active AGN near the Crab nebula (Heinke 2010). The INTEGRAL follew—up
Observation from 21:05 on September 22 to 11:12 on September 23 (UT), approximately corre—
sponding to the end of the ﬂare, found no signiﬁcant Change in the pulse proﬁle in the 20—40
keV band (Balbo et al. 2011).

After the gamma—ray ﬂare, the RXTE PCA follow—up observation on September 24
showed no Changes of ﬂux, spectrum nor pulse proﬁle (Shapeshnikev et al. 2010). The follow—
up Observation in a near—infrared wavelength on September 24 showed no variation in the Crab
pulsar in the J and H bands (Kanbaeh et al. 2010). The follew—up Observations by Chandra
on September 28 and the HST on October 2 revealed an anvil feature Close to the base of
the pulsar jet and elongated striati0r1 at the distant place (Tennant et al. 2010; Ferrigne et al.
2010b; Horns et al. 2010; Tavarii et al. 2011). These features are thought to indicate a particle
acceleration and the origin of the GeV gamma—ray ﬂare (Tavani et al. 2011). Two further GeV
gamma—ray ﬂare episodes, detected by AGILE on 2007 October and by Fermi—LAT on 2009
February, were reported (Tavani et al. 2011; Abdo et al. 2011). None Of these three gamma—ray
ﬂares showed any Changes of the pulsed component in the GeV energy range.

Another surprising thing is the long—term variability of the Crab nebula in the hard
X—ray bands reported by Wilsen—Hodge et al. (2011). The total nebula ﬂux was found to
decrease from 2008 August to 2010 J uly arid the fractional decline was larger in higher energy
ranges. On the other hand, the pulsed ﬂux in the 3.2 — 35 keV band of RXTE PCA decreased
steadily at N 0.2% yr‘l, consistent with the pulsar spin—down, indicating that the Observed
X—ray variability would originate not from the pulsar but from the nebula.

MAXI has been monitoring the Crab nebula since the beginning of the mission on 2009
August 15 (UT), which covered the whole gamma—ray ﬂare in 2010 September. Here, we report
on the MAXI monitoring of the pulse phase averaged and pulsed ﬂuxes of the Crab nebula, as
well as the pulse proﬁle.

2. Observation

MAXI (Monitor 0f All—sky X—ray Image) is an X—ray all—sky monitor, mounted on the
J apanese Experiment Module — Exposed Facility 0f the International Space Station (Matsuoka
et al. 2009). It carries two types of X—ray cameras: the Gas Slit Camera (GSC; Mihara et al.
2011; Sugizaki et al. 2011) for the 2—30 keV band and SOlid—state Slit Camera (SSC; Tsunemi
et al. 2010; Tomida et al. 2011) for the 05—12 keV band, using gas proportional counters and
X—ray CCDs, respectively. Since the time resolution of the SSC (5.6 s) is too long to detect the
pulsation 0f the Crab pulsar, we concentrate on the analysis Of the GSC data in this paper.

The GSC scans almost all the sky every 92 minutes with a ﬁeld of View (FOV) of 1.05

3

"
"4","(FWHM) by 1600. The effective area for any source is calculated according to the collimator
transmission function of a triangular shape during each scan transit (Sugizaki et al. 2011; Morii
et al. 2006; Morii, Sugimeri & Kawai 2010). The spatial resolution of the GSC is approximately
1.05 (FWHM). The time resolution of the GSC is 50 ,us. We conﬁrmed that the relative event
time was stable within the standard deviation of 0.2 ms throughout the whole Observation
period. The absolute time assignment was also conﬁrmed as accurate within the stability of
the relative time, by comparing the main peak phase of the Crab pulsar Obtained by the GSC
with that Of the RXTE PCA Observation (Rots, Jahoda & Lyne 2004).

3. Analysis and Results

3.]. Pulse phase averaged flua: 0f the Crab nebula

We examined the variation of the entire Crab nebula ﬂux averaged over the pulse phase.
We employed the same procedure to derive the Crab ﬂux to that in the effective—area calibration
described in Sugizaki et al. (2011). The source event data were extracted from the region of
1.06 radius from the Crab nebula. The background level was estimated from the data for the
adjacent souree—free sky region within the annulus with the inner and outer radii 0f 1.0 6 and 3.02,
respectively, where the region contaminated by the nearby bright source, namely A 0535+262,
was excluded. We used the data of the four anodes (C0, C3, C4, and C5) among the total of
six (C0—C5) for all the counters in this analysis because the other two were not calibrated well
for the complex energy—PHA responses (Sugizaki et al. 2011). Figure 1 (top panel) shows the
light curve Obtained in the 4—10 keV band in 2.5—day time bins. Here, the binning boundaries
were carefully Chosen to divide the ﬂare period (MJD 55457.5—554625) into two periods “A”
and “B” at MJD 55460 (see ﬁgure 2 in Balbo et al. 2011). The ﬂux for the entire ﬂare period
“A+B” and these for Periods A and B are shown in table 1.

The small ﬂuctuations in the light curve are thought to be not intrinsic to the Crab neb—
ula, but due to the systematic uncertainties in the GSC effective area calibration. To estimate
the systematic uncertainty, we ﬁtted the light curve with linear functions, the decline rate of
which was either set free or ﬁxed to that determined with the RXTE PCA light curve from MJ D
54690 to 55435 in the 2—15 keV band (Wilson—Hodge et al. 2011). The Obtained parameters of
the model functions are shown in table 2, where they are denoted as “Average: linear (free)” and
“Average: linear (ﬁxed)”, respectively. Assuming that the systematic uncertainty affects all the
data bins uniformly and is proportional to the ﬂux, we estimate the systematic uncertainty by
calculating the modiﬁed reduced Chi—squared xfed : D+3F ZZKFZ — Fmodel(ti))2] / [012512. + (rsystFZ-ﬂ
fer a tentative systematic uncertainty (rsyst). Here, E- and 0171. are the ﬂux and statistical error
at the i—th time bir1 (ti), respectively. Fmodel arid DOF are the model function for the ﬂux and
the degree of freedom, respectively. We then estimated the systematic uncertainty of 1—0 level
by searching for the rsyst to make the reduced Chi—squared unity. The Obtained systematic uri—

4

"
"5","certainties were 2% in both cases. On the other hand, the maximum deviation from the best—ﬂt
functions was 8% among 118 time bins in both cases. Since the latter deviation is statistically
large in comparison with the former uncertainty, there are some peculiar bir1s which are subject
to larger systematic uncertainty.

The ﬂux variations observed during Periods A, B, and A+B are statistically consistent
with the best ﬁt linear model. We calculated the upper limits on the variation of the ﬂux
during the ﬂare, expressed by the excess ratio (%) to the best—ﬂt model functions (table 2).
The statistical 90% conﬁdence level upper limits during Period A+B are 1.0 and 0.8% for the
two linear model functions. The values during Periods A and B are also shown in table 2.

To investigate the variability corresponding to the sub—ﬂares observed by Fermi—LAT
(Balbo et a1. 2011), we made the 05—day binned light curve in the 4—10 keV band during the
ﬂare interval as shown in ﬁgure 2 (top panel). The deviation from the best—ﬂt linear function
“Average: linear (free)” of table 2 is not statistically signiﬁcant with a reduced chi—squared of
1.13 for 12 degree of freedom (DOF).

3.2. Pulsed flua: 0f the Crab pulsar deduced from sub—scan—dumtz'on data analysis

To measure the pulsed ﬂux of the Crab pulsar, we analyzed the data by the following
steps. Since the background rate within the FoV depends on the position in the detector, we
extracted events based on the detector coordinate. We selected events within 5 mm from the
position coincident with the Crab nebula along the anode wires, which corresponds to about 20
on the sky. We removed events from the scan period when the instantaneous effective area of a
GSC camera was smaller than 1 cm2. This is because the systematic uncertainty and the signal—
to—background ratio worsen under this condition. The photon arrival times were corrected to
the solar system barycer1ter by mxbarycen, the validity of which was conﬁrmed by the timing
calibration (Sugizaki et a1. 2011). We chose the energy band of 4 — 10 keV. The events with
corrected times were folded in the pulse period of the Crab pulsar of the Jodrell Bank radio
observatory (Lyne, Pritchard, & Smith 1993). We applied corrections of the effective area and
exposure in this step.

The pulse proﬁle during Period A+B is shown in ﬁgure 3, where the phase zero corre—
sponds to that of the ﬁrst main pulse in radio (Lyne, Pritchard, & Smith 1993). To compare
it with the normal pulse proﬁle of the Crab pulsar, we made a template pulse proﬁle T (gbz)
(2' : 1st, ---, N —th phase bin; N : 64 and gb is the pulse phase.) by averaging the proﬁle from
2009 December 13 to 2010 J anuary 11, in which the un—pulsed component was subtracted. We
ﬁt the pulse proﬁle during the gamma—ray ﬂare to a model a X T (gb) + b, where a and I) represent
the scale factor of the pulsed component relative to the template and the constant oﬂset rep—
resenting the background and the nebula component. The best—ﬂt model is shown as the solid
line in ﬁgure 3, where the reduced chi—squared of the ﬁt is 1.34 for 62 DOF. We also performed
the same analysis for the pulse proﬁles during Periods A and B. The reduced chi—squared of the

ﬁts are 0.92 and 1.35 for 62 DOF in these periods. All the pulse proﬁles during Periods A, B

the pulse proﬁle ﬁtting, we also Obtained the pulsed ﬂux by aZ,T (gb,) / N 1, the results of Which
are shown in table 1. This method is free from background variation because the background
variation only affects the Offset parameter b.

We repeated the same analysis from 2009 November 1 to 2010 November 29 every 2.5
days to make the light curve of the pulsed ﬂux in the 4—10 keV band [Figure 1 (bottom panel)]
and ﬁtted it by a constant. The reduced Chi—squared 0f the ﬁt is 1.27 for 104 DOF, meaning that
there was no evidence of variability. The ﬂux Obtained is shown in table 2. The ﬂux variations
Observed during Periods A, B, and A+B are statistically consistent With the best ﬁt function.
The statistical 90% conﬁdence level upper limits on the variation of the pulsed ﬂuxes for these
periods are 9.0, 37.3, and 18.8%, respectively (table 2). The 05—day binned light curve of the
pulsed ﬁuX around the ﬂare period is shown in ﬁgure 2 (bottom panel). The variation from
the best—ﬁt constant function “Pulsed: eonst” of table 2 is not statistically signiﬁcant With a
reduced Chi—squared of 1.44 for 12 DOF.

1 Please note that the pulse proﬁles are not normalized to unity but have the unit of counts cm_2 s_l.
Therefore, this value becomes the pulsed ﬂux.

4. Conclusion
We report 011 the MAXI GSC Observation of the Crab nebula during the GeV gamma—ray
ﬂare. We successfully detected the pulsation 0f the Crab pulsar during the simultaneous period,
and conclude that there is no evidence for Changes in the pulse proﬁle, pulsed ﬂux and pulse
phase averaged ﬂux during the gamma—ray ﬂare. We Obtained an upper limit 011 the variation
of the pulse phase averaged ﬂux of 1% at a 90% conﬁdence limit of the statistical uncertainty
from the best—ﬂt linear function during the 5 day interval of the gamma—ray ﬂare in the 4—10
keV band. During the same period in the same energy band, we also Obtained an upper limit
011 the variation of the pulsed ﬂux of 19% at a 90% conﬁdence limit of statistical uncertainty
from the mean level.

The MAXI GSC simultaneous Observation With the gamma—ray ﬂare is uniquely impor—
tant to constrain the origin of the ﬂare; in contrast to the fOHOW—up Observations performed
after the cease 0f the gamma—ray ﬂare. The lack of Changes on the pulsed component in the
X—ray (this work); as well as these in radio (Espinoza et a1. 2010); hard X—ray (Super—AGILE
Observation at the ﬂare 011 2007 shown in Tavani et a1. (2011)) and gamma—ray bands (Tavani
et a1. 2011; Abde et a1. 2011); supports the nebular origin for the gamma—ray ﬂare as proposed
in several papers (Tavani et a1. 2011; Abde et a1. 2011; Bednarek 85 Idec 2010; Yuan et a1.
2010; Kemissarev 85 Lyutikev 2010). In spite of the large ﬂux increase of factor ﬁve in the
GeV energy region (Abde et a1. 2011); we constrain a limit 011 the variation of the nebula ﬂux
in the X—ray band. This provides valuable information to construct theoretical models for the
gamma—ray ﬂare 0f the Crab nebula.
