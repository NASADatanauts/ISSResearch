There are yet unresolved spinal changes during and after microgravity exposure. Crewmembers frequently report
moderate to severe back pain in space and upon return to Earth, a high incidence of intervertebral disc (IVD)
herniations Within regions of the cervical and lumbar spine. In response to NASA’s Critical Path Roadmap Risks
and Questions regarding disc injury and higher incidence of HNPs after space ﬂight (IRP Gap-B4), we are
performing state-of—the art imaging analyses of crewmembers to investigate the mechanisms of in-ﬂight back pain
and IVD herniations post-ﬂight. Twelve International Space Station crewmembers are approved for participation in
this study. To date, siX crew members have consented to our protocol and ﬁve have completed all pre-ﬂight and
post-ﬂight testing. Crewmembers complete a battery of siX tests before and after a 6 month mission to determine
how the discs and other spinal structures change and Whether anatomical alterations correlate With reported back
pain. Pre-ﬂight and post-ﬂight baseline data are derived from siX tests: 1. Supine MRI lumbar and cervical spines
(m0rph010gy/water content), 2. MR Spectroscopy (IVD metabolites), 3. Upright MRI (axial load With 10%
bodyweight), 4. Spinal Kinematics With the KineGraph Vertebral Motion Analyzer (lumbar spine stiffness and
stability), 5. Biering-Serensen test (isometric endurance strength test of the back muscles), and 6. Back pain and
disability questionnaires. Comparative analyses of post-ﬂight t0 pre-ﬂight data indicate: 1) Variable water content
changes variable in lumbar and cervical IVD heights observed in supine MRI scans, 2) Increased axial
compressibility of lumbar IVDs during upright MRI scans, 3) Increased lumbar bending stiffness using Spinal
Kinematics tests, 4) Paraspinal muscle atrophy from MRI, 4) Decreased isometric endurance of the back extensors,
and 5) Increased low back pain scores post-ﬂight. Countermeasures development for lumbar back pain on future
spaceﬂights may include in-ﬂight use of an axial compression device or spine compression maneuvers to prevent
spinal straightening and stiffening, and exercises to provide Earth-like biomechanical stress With low-load, repetitive
spine rotations. Crewmembers reported that a knee-to-chest position relieves in-ﬂight lumbar back. This manual
compressive loading of the IVDs may counteract increase ﬂuid transfer across IVD endplates and back into the
vertebral body circulation. This project Will deﬁne spine maladaptive effects from prolonged spaceﬂight, help
develop countermeasures and perhaps reduce pain and dysfunction in order to enhance astronauts’ performance of
complex mission tasks. Supported by NASA grants NNXlOAM18G and NNX13AM89G.

"2","INTRODUCTION
Back pain in microgravity is known as one of the most common problems experienced by
astronautsl'3 . This condition may be an indication of injury and may present as a possible
detrimental factor to a orewmember’s ability to perform complex tasks Via disruption of
restorative sleep and potentially, impairment to mental oonoentration4'5 . A retrospective study
from the Flight Medical Clinic at NASA J ohnson Space Center indicated that among orbiter
orewmembers, 68% report low back pain during short duration spaceﬂight varying in duration
from 14% to 100% of the ﬂight. Twenty-eight percent of orewmembers described the back pain
quality as moderate to severe in intensity6. The exact pathogenesis of back pain With
microgravity exposure is unknown, but available studies strongly indicate that the pliable
intervertebral disc is the most likely pain generator4'5 .
Terrestrial low back pain may precede more debilitating conditions such as a herniated nucleus
pulposus (HNP). Historically, an analysis of epidemiological data from NASA’s Longitudinal
Study of Astronaut Health at J ohnson Space Center reveals that 19 HNPs occurred in 17 events
among 15 orewmembers7'8. These data indicate that NASA’s astronaut population has
experienced a higher rate of HNP per 1000 person years When compared to the general
population and to an aviation population”. Spinal stressors may be different between the
astronaut, aviator, and general population, and as such, microgravity exposure in itself is a
unique condition variable to the astronaut population and therefore, a likely an important factor
to be considered to cause group differences in HNP risk. In microgravity, the body lengthens 4-
6.0 01119'10 or about 2-3 times the normal diumal increase (1-2 cm on Earth)11'12. This
extraordinary increase of body length has been attributed to possibly, disc swelling due to
reduced spinal forces, in tandem With reduced thoracic and lumbar curvatures13 '15 . Anatomic
locations of pain reported by astronauts during space travel are: 50% low back, 11% mid back,
11% neck, 2% abdomen, and 1% ohest6.
The exact pathomeohanism to explain the cause of low back pain in microgravity is currently
undeﬁned. The etiology of back pain in space is not clearly understood While the etiology of
back pain on Earth is broadly classiﬁed as Visceral, non-meohanioal, and mechanical (the latter
being attributed to lumbar discs)”. A signiﬁcant clue that miorogravity-induoed back pain is
mechanical in origin lies With orbiter orewmembers’ reports that pain is relieved by assuming a
“fetal tuck position”, described as a “cannon ball position” or curling the spine and knees to
chest position (Figure 1)3’6’17. This spinal conﬁguration most likely produces a compressive load
Via muscle contraction of the spine ﬂexors (in the absence of gravitational load) and, stretches
the back muscles, posterior ligaments, nervous structures, and facet jointslg. Also known as the
“fetal position,” this posture also opens up the intervertebral foramen, thereby creating more
space for spinal nerve roots. It is a possibility that abnormal features common in middle age such
as facet joint osteoarthritis, inﬂammation, and spinal stenosislg, as well as other mechanisms may
generate pain during early re-adaptation to microgravity. Our MRI studies offer unique insights
into mechanisms of back pain in space and risks to discs upon re-adaptation to Earth gravity.

To our knowledge, this comprehensive study is ﬁrst to examine morphological, biochemical,
metabolic, and kinematic changes in the lumbar spine induced by spaceﬂight and to correlate
these speciﬁc changes With erewmember complaints of low back pain. The current investigative
techniques are the best available, state-of—the-art tools to our knowledge, to quantify, document,
compare, and analyze spinal features pre- and post-ﬂight that are clinically suspected as low-
back pain generators in astronauts. By correlating these With ﬂight-induced changes in back pain
intensity and disability, we expect to deﬁne a subset of factors that Will continue to motivate
clinical, medical, and biomechanical disciplines to development of effective countermeasures.
Review of the Lumbar Intervertebral Discs
The lumbar intervertebral disc (IVD) is the largest avascular and alymphatie tissue in the body
With limited blood supply conﬁned to microscopic blood vessels at the external annulus and
embedded Within the adj acent vertebral b0dies20'21. The constituents of the IVD are primarily
ﬂuid, proteoglycan (PG), glycosaminoglycan (GAG), cartilage cells, ﬁbroblasts, and collagen
ﬁbers in varied proportions between the nucleus pulposus, annulus ﬁbrosus, While the
cartilaginous endplates separate the disc from the adjacent bony vertebral bodies. Due to its high
electronegative charge PG has a high swelling pressure measuring between 1-3 atm, thus
retaining ﬂuid in the nucleus pulposus Within the conﬁnes of an intact annulus ﬁbrosus despite
high external load during weight bearing”. IVD homeostatic ﬂuid and nutrient transport
between the lumbar intervertebral discs and vertebral capillaries probably occurs by two
processes: convection and diffusion. Convective ﬂow is induced by ﬂuctuations in spinal forces
that drive ﬂuid from the disc Via channels in the vertebral endplates and is typically due to
dynamic compressive load to the spine during activities in 1G. Diffusion 0n the other hand
represents a slower transport mechanism Where solutes move along a concentration gradient that
occurs during unloading of the spine such as during sleeping23 .
Dynamic upright activity, gravity and spine muscle contraction generate high axial compressive
loads on the spine that exceed the disc’s ability to swell, and thereby cause diurnal ﬂuctuations in
body height24. The total spinal load in weight-bearing activities increase ﬂuid pressure and
initiates ﬂuid efﬂuX from the nucleus pulposus, across the endplates and into the vertebral blood
3

"
"4","oiroulation25'26. Conversely, disc ﬂuid inﬂow is facilitated during sleep When the spine loading
pressures are now below the nucleus” swelling pressure22'23 . It can easily be surmised that
homeostasis of the IVD require a cyclic variation of intradisoal pressure to facilitate transport of
nutrients, water, and waste products essential for tissue Viability and physiologic stress
distributions22. It is measured that approximately 25% of the disc’s ﬂuid is exchanged during
each diurnal cycle on Earth”, the magnitude and rate of IVD ﬂuid exchange in microgravity is
unknown but most likely less than that on Earth.

Cyclical ﬂuctuations in disc pressure and water content on Earth serve as physical stressors that
may have significant effects on the IVD cellular constituents. Cellular components essential to
maintain the disc and endplate’s structural integrity are ﬁbroblasts and scattered chondrocyte-
like cells”. These cells have the capacity to transform mechanical signals rapidly and
differentially, and in doing so, alter their behavior, a process termed ‘meohanotransduotion’29'3 1.
Physiological levels of cyclical pressure are anabolic, and lead to disc cell matrix synthesis32.
Studies conﬁrm that external loads, contraction of the muscles, and tension between the
ligaments of the vertebral column promote collagen matrix strength and GAG production30’33’
35’36. Consequently, cyclic variances in disc hydrostatic pressure, collagen deformation, and ﬂuid
exchange due to the diurnal, dynamic loading of the disc in 1G are important mechanical
stressors necessary for IVD homeostasis and Viability. On the contrary, supraphysiologio or
subphysiologio loading can lead to oatabolism, resulting in matrix degrading enzyme production,
inﬂammation, and cell death37'38.

The disc is innervated by a class of nooioeptors known as Type IV meohanoreoeptors that are
sensitized by excessive collagen deformation, heat, pH levels, as well as inﬂammatory
mediators39'41. These nooioeptors embedded in the substance of the annulus, the posterior
longitudinal ligament, and vertebral endplate convey nerve impulses interpreted as discomfort or
pain42'43 . Nooioeptive innervation in the IVD is limited to the periphery and into one third of the
annulus substance and in the cartilage endplate With nerve impulses transmitted Via the
sinuvertebral and basivertebral nerves respectively“. In addition, the sinuvertebral nerve also
innervates the anterior dura, blood vessel walls, periosteum, and ligaments45. Other non-
nooioeptive meohanoreoeptors embedded in the annulus also include Type I (Rufﬂni oorpusoles),
Type II (Paoinian oorpusoles), and Type III (Golgi tendon organ (GTO) homologues 40’41’46
Which provide spatial orientation. These proprioceptive meohanoreoeptors are facilitated by
normal physiological collagen deformation When the loaded spine moves With muscle
contraction. These meohanoreoeptors are also crucial in providing a neurological feedback
mechanism directly mediating normal vertebral segment position sensibility and muscular reﬂex
stabilization“. These proprioceptive meohanoreptors When activated also produce centrally
mediated pain relief Via enkephalinergio neutralization of Substance P in the dorsal horn48 .
Biomechanios of Spine Stability

The spinal column functions to support the mass of the torso and facilitates its coordinated
movement. Its postural and functional stability is determined by a synergy between passive
constraints (deﬁned by osteoligamentous tissues such as the vertebra, intervertebral discs, and
intervertebral ligaments) and active constraints (deﬁned by the spinal muscles such as the psoas,
ereotor spinae and multifidus)49. During stable, upright posture, and dynamic movements, the

4

"
"5","contribution of passive and active constraints varies at each spinal level. Alterations in the
biomechanical properties of either the passive or active components (due to disc degeneration or
muscle atrophy and fatigue) as well as the neurological feedback mechanisms may impair
stability and can lead to neuromuscular errors causing brief uncontrolled intervertebral
movement and subsequent tissue strain injury”. This biomechanical hypothesis for IVD injury is
supported by evidence that the eross-seetional area of the paraspinal muscles is smaller in
patients With chronic low back pain5 1, and that early onset muscle fatigue leads to changes in
muscle recruitment patterns and increases in stress to spinal structures52 and decreases in spinal
stability”.

Part of our underlying hypotheses regarding risk of spinal injury during microgravity exposure is
that space ﬂight may induce temporal and maladaptive changes in the stiffness and synergy of
the passive and active spinal constraints. These time-dependent changes likely occur at different
rates for passive tissues (e.g. IVDs) and active tissues (e.g. spinal muscles) such that the usual
synergy required for natural spinal biomechanics is disrupted. Additionally, recovery also likely
occurs at different rates for passive and active spinal tissues, leading to increased injury risk from
sudden, uncontrolled intervertebral movements during the post-ﬂight re-adaptation t0 1 G and
subsequent recuperation period.

Actual and Simulated Micro gravity Conditions

On Earth, excessive spinal loading beyond physiological limits such as high levels of static
compression, produces stress and strain to the soft tissue and bony structures that induce
degeneration, injury, and cause low back pain26’37. Since weight 011 the spine is reduced in space,
the accepted correlation on Earth between spine loading, disc degeneration, and pain 011 may be
different during microgravity circumstances. One hypothesized mechanism of microgravity-
induced back pain is maladaptation from reduced 1G homeostatic loading described as “reduced
amplitudes and frequencies of spine motion”53 . When an astronaut’s spine lengthens in
microgravity, reduced loading may ﬂatten the lumbar spine and because there is a reduction of
hydrostatic pressure to counter nuclear swelling, the nucleus pulposus may increase its volume
and water content, and decreases its osmolarity. The resulting hypo-osmotic environment may
lead to supraphysiologie disc cell swelling, eytoskeletal reorganization, and decreased matrix
synthesis30. As a consequence, nucleus swelling increases diffusive transport distances for
nutrients between capillaries in adj acent vertebral endplates and cells in the nucleus. Importantly,
it is well recognized that nucleus cell density and function are inversely related to disc height —
as disc height increases, cells become hypoxie and acidic“. During hypoxie conditions, disc
cellular components secrete lactic acid (LA), cytokines, and proteases34. The resulting hypoxia
combined With low pH from increased LA may biochemically induce disc cell death, matrix
disruption, endplate sclerosis 0r degeneration, and nociceptor sensitization leading to pain
perception. Importantly, IVD health through anabolism With matrix synthesis result from
dynamic spine compression With cyclical loading as it introduces physiologic
meehanotransduction55 . Reduced dynamic and cyclical compressive loads in space probably
result in down-regulation of the production of critical nuclear and annular matrix constituents
thereby potentially reducing the structural integrity of the IVD. We hypothesize that
microgravity exposure may have adverse biological effects that ultimately weaken the structural
components of the IVD and cause injury When re-introduced back to loading conditions in 1G.

5

"
"6","These hypotheses parallel animal models With simulated or actual microgravity exposure
experiments Which demonstrate histological and biomechanical evidence of less ordered annular
collagen and decreased nuclear proteoglycan56'60. Loss of physiologic loading to the spine
during microgravity conditions tips the biologic and homeostatic balance Within the IVD,
cartilage and muscle tissues of the spine towards matrix catabolism, atrophy and structural tissue
weakening; all resulting in abnormally elevated lumbar spine compressibility and risk of disc
herniation upon return back to 1G“.
In summary, low back pain and herniated nucleus pulposus are real and signiﬁcant problems for
crewmembers and can be debilitatingl. Increased risk for these conditions is likely caused by
deeonditioning and maladaptation from microgravity exposure that can have deleterious
catabolie effects on both passive and active tissues necessary for spinal stability. The passive
stiffness of the IVD can be either temporarily increased due to swelling, or subsequently
decreased due to biochemical alterations and cell dysfunction leading to structural weakness or
joint contracture. The active stiffness of spinal muscles likely decreases due to disuse atrophy
and reduction in eoordinative neuromechanisms t0 the intervertebral segment. Our results 011
lumbar and cervical spine anatomy, metabolism and biomechanics Will help establish a more
deﬁnitive understanding of spinal adaptations to space ﬂight and can serve as a guide in the
upcoming development of appropriate countermeasures.

SPACE FLIGHT STUDY
The preliminary results presented in this review paper are derived from the complete set of pre-
and post-ﬂight data from 5 crewmembers after 180 day missions on board the International
Space Station (188). These data are inclusive of the on-going ISS ﬂight study, “Risk of
Intervertebral Disc Damage after Prolonged Space Flight” approved for 12 astronauts under
NASA grants NNXlOAMlSG and NNX13AM89G.
Research Products
We are utilizing state-of—the-art, non-invasive imaging technologies to quantify morphology,
biochemistry, metabolism, and kinematics for lumbar discs of crew members before and after
prolonged space ﬂight. Importantly, data correlation With low back pain that spontaneously
arises in space Will establish the most likely pathomeehanisms that Will serve as basis for
deﬁnitive 011- going countermeasure development. After successful completion of data collection
pre- and post-ﬂight from a total of 12 crewmembers, we Will be able deliver a comprehensive
database of microgravity-indueed intervertebral disc and vertebral changes (type and magnitude)
and a prioritization of these changes as to their deleterious effects and risks for crew member
injury based on clinical ﬁndings.
Relevance of the Research Products
We are currently using a well-doeumented and validated battery of non-invasive, image-based
tests to identify and quantify spinal features that clinically correlate With low back pain.
Importantly, data from these tests Will clarify injury mechanisms and understand the
pathophysiology of back pain in space to serve as a basis for countermeasure development.
6

"
"7","We hypothesize that spontaneous spaoe-ﬂight back pain and debilitating post-ﬂight HNP are due
to biomechanioal and biological pathomeohanisms from maladaptation to microgravity. First,
reduced motion and loading in microgravity may stiffen the lumbar motion segment, produce
weakening of IVD collagen framework, and cause abnormal segmental movement patterns.
These biomechanioal changes probably alter forces and load sharing amongst spinal tissues and
in doing so, may increase risk for annular rupture, vertebral endplate mioroﬁaoture, and facet
joint capsule strain. Second, unloaded discs in microgravity may have reduced nuclear matrix
production and nutrient transport from endplate capillaries in adj aoent vertebra. We propose that
these factors may adversely affect disc cell metabolism, causing pain (Via increased synthesis of
lactic acid) and inducing disc matrix degradation [Via decreased proteoglyoan (PG) synthesis and
increased secretion of matrix metalloproteinases]. Atrophy of the anti-graVity spinal muscles
With ensuing weakness and alteration of neuromuscular ooordinative movement patterns may
also contribute to reduced intervertebral stability upon return and re-loading in 1G.

Our proj eot directly addresses Critical Path Roadmap Risks and Questions regarding disc injury
(IRP Gap-B4): Is damage to joint structure, intervertebral discs, or ligaments incurred during or
following microgravity exposure? Preliminary ﬁndings that have been gathered to date are
beginning to reveal a more precise insight in understanding the underlying pathophysiology of
spinal deoonditioning induced by microgravity, and mechanisms of disc prolapse or herniation
following re-eXposure to 1G. At the completion of this study, our long-term goal is to prevent
such spinal deoonditioning to occur among orewmembers With a soientiﬁoally-designed exercise
regimen or other physiologic countermeasures. The ﬁnal obj eotive of this comprehensive
research is to clearly deﬁne and characterize spaoe-ﬂight induced maladaptive changes in spinal
tissue morphology, biochemistry, metabolism, and kinematics by comparing pre- and post-ﬂight,
non-invasive spinal images. In addition, these data Will also be correlated With measures of back
pain intensity and disability. Taken to gether, our results Will test our current hypotheses
regarding low back pain mechanisms and HNP development so as to deﬁne specific, quantitative
targets for future countermeasure development.

Speciﬁc Aims of this Project

The speciﬁc aims of this proj eot intend: (1) to measure disc, facet joint, and paraspinal muscle
morphology and document pathologio features using MRI imaging. Using sagittal scans, we will
measure disc height, nucleus area, Pﬁrrmann degeneration grade (Figure 2), along With
previously-validated features associated With disoogenio pain: annulus high intensity zones (HIZ)
and bone marrow intensity changes62 (Figure 3). The cervical spine has also been added as a
parallel investigation; (2) to measure disc free water content using quantitative MR calculation of
T2 relaxation63 ; (3) to measure disc nucleus metabolites previously linked to hypoxio stress and
disoogenio low back pain (lactate and alanine) using single voxel MR spectroscopy64 (4) to
measure in Vivo spinal kinematics to assess segmental stiffness and biomechanical instability
using digitized Videoﬂuorosoopio images of the lumbar spine and customized analysis software65
(Figure 4); (5) to document orewmember pre- and post-ﬂight back pain using validated pain
(VAS) and disability (Oswestry) questionnaires66 and functional testing (Biering-Sorensen test)67
(Figure 5); and ﬁnally, (6) To measure lumbar spine compressibility as a functional diso-risk test
in orewmembers pre- and post-ﬂight60.

POWER ANALYSIS
This study utilizes a comprehensive set of tests to evaluate exposure severity, potential injury
mechanisms, and pain generator localization pre- and post- (RH) ﬂight. These tests in review
include MRI (morphology and water content), MR spectroscopy (metabolites), MRI With axial
loading conditions, Spinal Kinematics (stiffness and stability), Biering-Serensen test, and a back
pain questionnaire. To assess risk factors of IVD damage based on our preliminary ﬁndings
from a completed set of pre- and post-ﬂight data from ﬁve crewmembers, an assessment was
performed utilizing parameters that may precede these structural changes. These include disc
hydration (% water content measured by MRI) and segmental spine stiffness (measured by
Spinal Kinematics). Utilizing margins of error from initial population effect sizes, our power
analysis curves for the various parameters are available Figure 1 (red curve). As we revisit each
test With mid-study results, the achieved post hoc power for each test is superimposed over the
initial power curve. The effect sizes for each measured parameter demonstrate a good ﬁt With the
initial assessment requiring 12 188 crew members. The conﬁdence of statistically-signiﬁcance
differences observed between pre- and post-ﬂight data is expected to attain a value at or above
80% (green data point) (Fig. 6).

power curve was based upon preliminary data of ﬂuoroscopic spinal kinematics stiffness measurements comparing
subj ects pre- and post-ﬂight. Post hoc values for achieved power were calculated using key parameters from each
project and their respective effect sizes, and then plotted with respect to the number of subjects included. Certain
projects are showing initial strong effect size and should attain statistically signiﬁcant power early on, but the initial
assessment appears to be a good ﬁt for other data sets as well. A few proj ects, such as disc hydration and disc height
demonstrate low effect sizes between pre- and post-ﬂight subjects and the variance observed between subjects may
lead to the conclusion that little or no differences exist.
RELEVANT PRELIMINARY RESULTS TO DATE
From the analysis of data collection derived from the initial 5 orewmembers tested pre- and post-
ﬂight, the maj or results to date are:
1. Water content changes in the IVD are variable between orewmembers. There were noted
IVD changes that were variable between orewmembers and between spinal levels.
2. No significant changes in disc height or lumbar length.
3. One episode of HNP 30 days post-ﬂight (Figure 7).

DISCUSSION
The preliminary results do conﬁrm measurable changes in the spines of crewmembers pre- and
post-ﬂight after 180 day missions on board the International Space Station. We initially
anticipated that microgravity exposure Will induce a supraphysiologic swelling of the IVD,
decreases in lumbar 10rd0sis and decreases in spinal muscle CSA. Our current ﬁndings do not
show IVD swelling from ﬁve ISS crew members tested to date. However, due to the small
sample size, no signiﬁcant changes in disc height and lumbar length can be currently reported.
In one crewmember post-ﬂight Medic changes68 (vertebral bone inﬂammation) have been
observed indicating vertebral bone inﬂammation Which may present as another possible pain
generator. Reduced bone mass during exposure to microgravity coupled With relatively high
compression to the vertebrae may contribute to bone inﬂammation in the absence of infection. In
a state of weakened trabeculae 0f the vertebra, endplate protrusions into adj acent vertebral bodies
may be caused by high compressive loading using the Advanced Resistive Exercise Device or
upon the impact of the Soyuz capsule landing When returning to Earth. Decreased quality of
vertebral bodies was observed in this initial set of data With anterior wedging 0f the lumbar
vertebral bodies of the crewmembers. In the case of ISS crewmembers, wedging of lumbar
vertebrae may indicate the same pathomechanism as above Where greater magnitude of anterior
compression meets weakened vertebral trabeculae.
Decreased functional extensor time (Biering-Sarensen test) is consistent With weakness of the
supportive spinal muscles as a maladaptation t0 microgravity in the absence of the usual
gravitational stress challenges for upright postures. Weakness parallels the observed decreased
functional cross-sectional area of lumbar and cervical muscles. On an average, 4/5 crewmembers
10st 14% CSA 0f the lumbar paraspinal muscle and cervical functional CSA reduced 17% despite
the re-acclimation protocols and rehabilitation exercises. These results further necessitate the
development of more precise exercise protocols designed for speciﬁc muscles of the spine in
13

"
"14","conjunction with an artiﬁcially induced gravitational ﬁeld or spine loading by development of
novel compression harnesses, new exercise equipment, or a combination of both.
Increased spine stiffness in ﬂexion was noted with dynamic ﬂuoroscopy. The stiffness was
measurable in each intervertebral segment and consistent with our initial hypothesis that we
anticipated that microgravity induced IVD swelling which may cause tensioning 0f the annulus
and paraspinal ligamentous tissues, leading to decreased passive ROM at each lumbar level.
During re-adaptation to gravity, there may be a relatively-slow equilibration of nucleus water
content, volume, and disc height to pre-ﬂight values. Increased spine straightening due to
reduction of lumbar lordosis was observed among the 5 crewmembers with an average 11%
reduction of lumbar lordosis. This phenomenon appears consistent with effects of IVD swelling
whereas when the anterior heights of the IVD occurs in the absence of a compressive load to the
lumbar spines, the bowstring effect described as lordosis is also reduced.
Lastly, vertebral endplate irregularities were observed. Endplates serve as a loadbearing interface
between the vertebral body and IVD with a balanced amount of porosity to facilitate cyclical
inﬂux and efﬂux of ﬂuids and nutrition. (Lotz, Fields, Liebenberg, 2013). The irregularities post-
ﬂight may be consistent with degenerative changes where applied loading between the
intervertebral segments whether in-ﬂight 0r post-ﬂight may be relatively become excessive when
cartilage properties become less resilient perhaps through structural weakening from
biomechanical and chemical factors as a result of altered homeostasis with reduced cyclical
loading in space. Post-ﬂight low back pain may arise from mechanical stimulation of chemically
sensitized endplate nociceptors.
This set of relevant preliminary ﬁndings point to obj ective changes in the anatomy and
biomechanics of spinal structures after microgravity exposure including the IVDs, vertebrae,
endplates and supportive muscles and ligaments. The deliverable conclusions from the complete
set of data from 12 crewmembers in the ﬁJture will lead to greater understanding of the
pathophysiology of microgravity-indueed back pain and incidence of HNPs post-ﬂight as well as
to serve as leverage points to aid countermeasure development to protect spine health of
astronauts during future planetary class space exploration.

CONCLUSION AND RECOMMENDATIONS
Preliminary information derived from a set of data pre- and post-ﬂight on ﬁve ISS crewmembers
document measurable changes occurring in the spinal structures after prolonged exposure to
microgravity. These findings include: 1.Water content changes in the IVD that are variable
between erewmembers. There were noted IVD changes that were variable between
crewmembers and between spinal levels; 2. No signiﬁcant changes in disc height and lumbar
length; 3. One episode of HNP 30 days post-ﬂight; 4. Decreased functional extensor time
(Biering-Serensen test); 5. Decreased functional eross-sectional area of lumbar and cervical
muscles. On an average, 4/5 crewmembers lost 14% CSA 0f the lumbar paraspinal muscle and
cervical functional CSA reduced 17%; 6. Partial recovery from paraspinal atrophy by R+45 (only
21% in cervical spine compared to 67% in lumbar spine); 7. Increased spine stiffness in ﬂexion;
8. Increased spine straightening due to reduction of lumbar lordosis. All ﬁve crewmembers have
14

"
"15","an average 11% reduction of lumbar 10rdosis; 9. Decreased quality of vertebral bodies; and 10.
Anterior wedging 0f the lumbar vertebral bodies. Countermeasure development may need to
consider a design to approximate daily terrestrial spine movement values for erewmembers With
an artiﬁcial gravitational ﬁeld to load the spine during space missions. Elements to achieve these
may include fabrication of novel compression garments and/or exercise equipment. New
exercise equipment or skin suits may need to be specially designed to resist target spine
supportive musculature With the appropriate dosage of mechanical input in conjunction With a
tandem axial loading system to the spine. The main obj eetive is to provide physiologic and
cyclical stress loading to the spine to provide more normal 1G diumal loads to the cervical and
lumbar regions of the spine.
