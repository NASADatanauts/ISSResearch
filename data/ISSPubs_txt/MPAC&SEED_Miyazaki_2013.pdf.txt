Abstract Atomic oxygen (A0) in low Earth orbit (LEO) is one of the most
dangerous environmental factors leading to erosion of the external materials of a
spacecraft. As one of the methods to improve AO tolerance, the use of silicon—
containing materials has been proposed. On such materials, an Si02 layer is formed
from the reaction of the silicon contained in the material and the AO existing in
orbit, which can therefore be called a “self—organized” layer. In the present study,
polysiloxane—block—polyimide “BSF—30”, which is a silicon—containing polyimide,
was investigated by ground testing and in a ﬂight experiment. BSF—30 was exposed
to the LEO space environment on the J apanese Experimental Module/Micro
Particles Capturer & Space Environment Exposure Device (JEM/MPAC&SEED)
mission on the 18$ for 8.5 months. As a result, a mass loss of 0.011 mg was
measured, which is about 1/500 times smaller than that of a common polyimide.
From a cross sectional transmission electron microscopy analysis the formation of a
layer about ~50 nm thick was observed on the exposed surface, within which high
fractions of Si and 0 were also detected. In conclusion, it is veriﬁed that BSF—30 has
sufﬁcient AO tolerance in a LEO environment by the JEM/MPAC&SEED.

1 Introduction

In low Earth orbit (LEO), Atomic Oxygen (A0) is one of the severe environmental
factors causing the materials placed on the outside of spacecraft to degrade [1, 2].
Originating from Earth’s atmosphere, oxygen molecules are dissociated into
neutral atoms by ultraviolet rays. The resultant AO remains at LEO altitude.
Spacecraft Circle the Earth in LEO orbits at a speed of around 8 km/s, colliding
with A0 at a high relative velocity that imparts the equivalent of around 5 eV of
translational energy, thereby causing erosion called AO Attack. Polyimide is a
well—known material prone to AO—attaek. The AO—attaek surface shows a distinc—
tive morphology with micrometer—sized asperities: a so—Called carpet or needle-
like shape. The A0 attack degrades the material properties. Improving space
materials’ tolerance against AO necessitates study of AO tolerance—improvement
techniques. Coating is a standard method, for which inorganic thin coatings such
as ITO and silicone resin are used [3—5]. However, such coatings must have high
reliability to maintain performance during missions and very low defects during
production because coating degradation engenders severe erosion of the base ﬁlm.
Furthermore, since hard inorganic coatings are very fragile, special care is
required for handling during assembly, thereby raising production costs. With
this in mind, a method to achieve AO tolerance other than coating should be
considered. One such method is the use of silicon—containing materials, the AO
tolerance of which has been investigated [6, 7].

A Si02 layer is formed from a reaction of the silicon contained in the material
and A0 existing in orbit; it can therefore be called a “self—organized” layer. The
layer functions as an AO—protective layer and also present advantages over ﬁlms
with manufactured AO—tolerant layers due to its self—healing function when the
layer is damaged. It is expected to facilitate handling on the ground and provide
high reliability in orbit.

The polysiloxane—block—polyimide ﬁlm “BSF—30” is focused on herein as one
silicon—Containing ﬁlm, which was developed for use on the ground, rather than in
space. The A0 tolerance of BSF—3O has been investigated by irradiation tests on the
ground, which revealed that BSF—3O is expected to show AO tolerance with Si02
layer formation by collision with A0 [8]. Subsequently, BSF—3O was selected as
one of the samples for the J apanese Experimental Module/Micro Particles Capturer
& Space Environment Exposure Device (JEM/MPAC&SEED) mission on the
International Space Station (ISS) [9]. BSF—3O was eXposed to the LEO space
environment on the ISS for 8.5 months, after which the samples were retrieved to
the ground to evaluate how they had Changed following exposure to the space
environment.

In this study, we report on the results of the evaluations for the polysiloxane—
bloek—polyimide “BSF—30” ﬁlm on JEM/MPAC&SEED, whereupon the tolerance
of BSF—3O against A0 is discussed based on the results of the after—retrieval
evaluation.

2 Experimental
2.1 Sample Preparation
Polysiloxane—bloek—polyimide “BSF—30” manufactured by Nippon Steel Chemical
C0., Ltd. mainly for terrestrial use in the electronic industry was used. For the JEM/
MPAC&SEED mission, BSF—30 was supplied as a 25—ttm—thick, A4—size ﬁlm.
25—mm—diameter pieces were cut from the ﬁlm for the JEM/MPAC&SEED
specimens. The specimen was held in place using an aluminum alloy frame of the
J EM/MPAC&SEED hardware with a 20—mm—diameter window, which was the area
exposed to space. The initial mass of the ﬂight specimen was 15,300 mg.
2.2 JEM/MPAC&SEED Mission
JEM/MPAC&SEED is an experimental hardware that was installed on the Space
Environment Data Acquisition equipment — Attached Payload (SEDA—AP) 0n the
JEM Exposed Facility 0f the 188 (Fig. 1).
The surface of the JEM/MPAC &SEED where the samples were installed faced
the RAM direction of the ISS, and high A0 ﬂuenee was expected.
The JEM/MPAC&SEED was launched by the Space Shuttle STS—127 in July
2009, and has begun the exposure to space on July 23, 2009 CDT. After exposure,

JEM/MPAC&SEED was retrieved into the ISS on April 9, 2010, and returned to the
ground by Space Shuttle mission STS—131 that landed on April 20, 2010. In other
words, the exposure duration of JEM/MPAC&SEED was 259 days (~85 months).
The environmental factors, e.g., A0 and UV ﬁuenees, were measured by “moni—
toring samples” installed on the J EM/MPAC&SEED. AO ﬁuenee was measured by
the mass loss of the polyimide sheet “VESPEL®” caused by A0 erosion, which can
be determined by the erosion yield measured by A0 irradiation tests on the ground
[10]. UV ﬁuenee was measured by the solar absorptance Change Of the polyurethane
sheet “DUS601” [10]. Based on evaluation of the monitoring samples, the environ—
mental factors were determined as shown in Table 1. The details of the evaluation
results for the monitoring samples are described in reference [11].
2.3 Evaluation T echniques
To evaluate the space environmental inﬂuence on the BSF—30 ﬁlm, macroscopic
Observation, mass measurement, and eross—seetional microscopic Observation were
carried out. For macroscopic Observation, a digital still camera was used. For mass
measurement, we used a mierobalance (readability 1 pg, maximum load 5,100 mg,
MXS; Mettler Toledo International Inc.). Water absorption into the sample was
measured during weighing. Therefore, to calculate the dry mass, it must be
compensated by extrapolation of the mass increase curve shown during weighing
0f the sample. The weighing procedure was as follows: the sample was stored in a
desiccator for at least 24 h; it was brought onto the mierobalance under controlled
ambient conditions of 23 i 2 OC and 50 i 5 % relative humidity and the mass was
established after holding the sample for 180 s on the balance after removal of the
sample from the desiccator. That measurement was then ﬁtted to a quadratic curve
to Obtain the estimated dry mass from the intercept of the ﬁtted curve. In particular,
for initial measurements, the samples were stored in a vacuum Chamber for at least
24 h in addition to the weighing procedure to eliminate errors caused by outgassing
in vacuum. The eross—seetional microstructure was Observed using a transmission
electron microscope (TEM H—7100; Hitachi Ltd.). Samples stained using RuO4
were sliced using an ultramicrotome to produce a cross—section, including the
exposed surface. To Obtain mierostruetural information, TEM Observation was
performed at an acceleration voltage of 100 kV and magniﬁcation of 200,000.
Scanning TEM/energy dispersive X—ray spectroscopy (STEM/EDX, using
JEM2100F/JED—2300 T; JEOL Ltd.) analysis was also performed in order to see
the elemental composition at very small areas and the elemental fraction was
calculated from the STEM/EDX spectrum.

3 Results and Discussion
3.1 Macroscopic Observation
Figure 2 shows a picture of the ﬂight sample. Figure 2a was taken during disassem—
bly 0f the retrieved JEM/MPAC&SEED hardware to remove the samples. As can
be seen from Fig. 2a, the surface of the sample was shiny and smooth. Figure 2b, C
were taken of the sample only, pre— and post—ﬂight. We can see that the center,
which was exposed to space, is darkened.
3.2 Mass Change Measurements
The measured mass is presented in Table 2. The mass loss by exposure to the LEO
space environment was 0.011 mg. Compared to the mass loss of typical polyimide,
assuming an A0 ﬂuenee equivalent to that of JEM/MPAC&SEED, the mass loss of
BSF—3O could be one ﬁve—hundredth or less of a typical polyimide.
3.3 Microscopic Observation
Figure 3 presents the eross—seetional TEM images of BSF—30. For pre—ﬂight
samples (Fig. 3a), no obvious layer is found at the exposed surface.

In the post—ﬂight sample a layer is observed along the exposed surface (Fig. 3b)
that is around 50 nm thick. From the STEM/EDX analysis the elemental composi—
tion of both surfaces was calculated (Fig. 4). For the pre—ﬂight sample (Fig. 4a), the
elemental composition of the surface layers is homogeneous and not dependent on
depth. For the post—ﬂight sample, however, (Fig. 4b), it was found that the elemental

composition depends on depth. The concentrations of Si and O are higher at the
sample surface and that of C is lower. This result indicates that the layer formed on
the surface exposed to the space environment could be Si—O rich.
4 Discussion on the Tolerance of BSF-30 Against the LED
Environment
Figure 5 shows a comparison between the mass Changes of the BSF—3O sample in
the present ﬂight and the mass Changes obtained from the ground AO irradiation
test [8]. Analyzing the data in Fig. 5, it can be suggested that the ﬂight sample
experienced a smaller mass Change compared to that for A0 irradiated samples on
the ground. In addition, as was discussed in Sect. 3.1.2, it was 1/500th of a typical
polyimide with equivalent AO ﬂuence. Thus, the mass loss of BSF—3O caused by
exposure to the LEO environment is small enough. It also should be noted that an
Si—O enriched layer was formed on the surface of the ﬂight sample as shown in
Fig. 3 that was not present on the pre—ﬂight sample surface. The thickness of the
formed layer for the ﬂight sample is ~50 nm and it exceeds the layer formed in the
ground AO irradiated sample, ~10 nm [8, 12].
It could be said that the formed Si—O layer was self—organized by exposure to
the A0 in orbit. From the discussed above points, i.e., a small mass loss and the
ability for self—organized layer formation, the BSF—3O material has a great

potential to serve as a protective layer with self—organizing capabilities upon
exposure to the A0 in LEO environment. It can be concluded that the tolerance
of BSF—30 against A0 in a real LEO environment has been veriﬁed through the
JEM/MPAC&SEED mission.

As was mentioned above, the thickness of the formed layer was higher then that
formed in A0 ground testing (50 nm vs. 10 nm). While some of the thickness could
be attributed to a Si—based contamination layer that is estimated at less than 10 nm
[13, 14], the nature of the rest of the formed Si—O layer is not Clear at the present.
Further work is required to Clarify this point.

5 Conclusions

We evaluated Polysiloxane—Bloek—Polyimide “BSF—30” material that was exposed
to space on JEM/MPAC&SEED for 8.5 months. Based on the results, we can
conclude that the BSF—30 was veriﬁed as having sufﬁcient tolerance against AO
existing in a LEO environment, based on both the mass loss, 0.011 mg, and the Si—O
rich self—organized layer formation. Following a comparison of the results between
Flight and A0 irradiation tests on the ground, it was found that the Si—O rich layer
formed on the exposed surface in ﬂight is ~50 nm thick, and is thicker than that
formed in the ground AO tests (~10 nm). With some of the thickness (less than
10 nm) attributed to a Si—based contamination layer, the nature of the rest of the
formed Si—O layer is not Clear at the present. Further work would be needed to Clarify
this point.
