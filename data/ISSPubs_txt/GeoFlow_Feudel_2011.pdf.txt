(Received 13 July 2010; published 6 April 2011)
Symmetry-breaking bifurcations have been studied for convection in a nonrotating spherical shell Whose outer
radius is twice the inner radius, under the inﬂuence of an externally applied central force ﬁeld With a radial
dependence proportional to 1 / r5 . This work is motivated by the GeoFlow experiment, Which is performed under
microgravity condition at the International Space Station where this particular central force can be generated.
In order to predict the observable patterns, simulations together With path-following techniques and stability
computations have been applied. Branches of aXisymmetric, octahedral, and seven-cell solutions have been
traced. The bifurcations producing them have been identiﬁed and their stability ranges determined. At higher
Rayleigh numbers, time-periodic states With a complex spatiotemporal symmetry are found, Which we call
breathing patterns.
