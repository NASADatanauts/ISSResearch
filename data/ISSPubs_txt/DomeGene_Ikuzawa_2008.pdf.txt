The random positioning machine (RPM) is a method used to generate a simulated-microgravity
environment at approximately 0 9. Using an RPM, we analyzed the global gene expression of A8
cells derived from the liver of adult Xenopus laevis. A range of genes on a Xenopus 44K-scale
microarray were up- or downregulated two-fold or more: 43 genes (up, 36 genes; down, 7 genes)
on culture day 5 in RPM, 74 genes (up, 48 genes; down, 26 genes) on day 8, 105 genes (up, 71
genes; down, 34 genes) on day 10, and 132 genes (up, 98 genes; down, 34 genes) on day 15. Five
genes were upregulated two-fold or more throughout culturing in RPM, while only one gene was
downregulated over the entire time. We then compared the expression patterns of the RPM-
dependent genes in the A8 cells with those in A6 cells established from the kidney of adult Xenopus
laevis. Six upregulated genes and three downregulated genes showed the same expression pat-
terns throughout the culturing of A6 and A8 cells in RPM. Such globally responsive genes may play
a common role in the cell response to simulated microgravity. We were particularly interested in
the downregulation of SPARC in both cell types in RPM, which supported previous observations
from simulated-microgravity experiments on earth or microgravity in space. We conclude that

SPARC is plays a key role in the response of a cell to microgravity.

Fig. 3. Expression patterns of up- or downregulated genes in A8 cells analyzed by RT-PCR and microarray. Gene expression in A8 cells was
compared between RPM and SC culturing by the signal intensities of RT-PCR and microarray analyses. Numbers below the panels show the
culture day. Genes showing RPM>SC (the gene expression in RPM was 2-fold higher than in SC) or RPM<SC (the gene expression in RPM
was 2—f0ld lower than in SC) were as follows: (A, B) MGC86479 and transforming growth factor, beta2, RPM>SC, day 5 to day 15; (C)
