The Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency (JAXA) started a high-quality

protein crystal growth project, now called JAXA PCG, on the International

Space Station (188) in 2002. Using the counter—diffusion technique, 14 sessions

of experiments have been performed as of 2012 with 580 proteins crystallized in

total. Over the course of these experiments, a user—friendly interface framework

for high accessibility has been constructed and crystallization techniques

improved; devices to maximize the use of the microgravity environment have

been designed, resulting in some high-resolution crystal growth. If crystal-

lization conditions were carefully ﬁxed in ground-based experiments, high-

quality protein crystals grew in microgravity in many experiments on the ISS,

especially when a highly homogeneous protein sample and a Viscous crystal-

lization solution were employed. In this article, the current status of JAXA PCG

is discussed, and a rational approach to high-quality protein crystal growth in

microgravity based on numerical analyses is eXplained.
