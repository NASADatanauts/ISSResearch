% Abstract
E
3 Reduced gravity combustion experiments were performed aboard the International Space
E Station with individual methanol and n-heptane droplets that had initial diameters in the 1.2-5.0
3‘ mm size range. Experiments were performed with air-inert mixtures at 0.1 and 0.07 MPa and
E about 298 K, where the monatomic gases helium and xenon were separately used as the added
g inert. These two gases have the same thermodynamic properties 011 a molar basis, but their
é transport properties are signiﬁcantly different, allowing investigation of transport property
é effects such as Lewis number variations on combustion phenomena. The results indicate that
E ambient gas transport properties play an important role in determining limiting oxygen indiees as
g; well as burning rates and radiant heat output histories of ﬂames. However, comparison with drop
we
Lg tower data suggests that initial droplet diameters may not play a signiﬁcant role in determining
8 limiting oxygen index values.

This research is in support of droplet combustion experiments performed onboard the
International Space Station (188), the Droplet Flame Extinguishment in Mierogravity (FLEX)
and the Fundamental Studies in Droplet Combustion and Flame Extinguishment in Microgravity
g (FLEX-2) experiments. The FLEX and FLEX-2 research efforts use reduced-gravity droplet

g ﬂammability and extinction under conditions relevant to space exploration as well as
E fundamental aspects of combustion of condensed-phase fuels. These experiments are designed to
E provide high-ﬁdelity data that can, for example, be used to validate both detailed and simpliﬁed
E) combustion models as well as to potentially identify new phenomena.
g Here we consider results from experiments on combustion of individual methanol and n-heptane
E
0% droplets in reduced gravity. The droplets were initially in the 1.2-5.0 mm size range and
<53 experiments were performed where air at 0.1 or 0.07 MPa was diluted with either helium 0r
5% xenon. These species are both noble gases, leading to the same adiabatic (thermodynamic) ﬂame
g; temperatures for the same fuels, environmental compositions, and pressures. However,
E differences in atomic masses/sizes between these species inﬂuence transport of mass and energy
to and from droplet ﬂame zones, leading to ﬂame temperature, combustion and ﬂammability
variations.
An important parameter in droplet combustion is the oxygen Lewis number, Le (Williams, 1985;
Cheatham and Matalon, 1996b; Kassoy and Williams, 1968; Law, 1982; Aharon and Shaw,

"
"4","1997; Shaw and Dee, 2005; Cheatham and Matalon, 1996a; Dietrich et a1., 2000). This Lewis
number, Which characterizes the relative importance of oxygen diffusion and thermal energy
diffusion, is the ratio of the mixture thermal diffusivity t0 the overall species diffusion
coefﬁcient of oxygen. The mixture thermal diffusivity Will change if the diluent alters the
mixture thermal conductivity, density or speciﬁc heat. The overall oxygen species diffusion
g coefﬁcient Will also be inﬂuenced by the diluent through variations in binary species diffusion
:3 coefﬁcients.
[5 Figure 1 shows variations in the oxygen Lewis number that were calculated at 1 atm and 1200 K
g for air/diluent mixtures. Addition of helium increases Le because of the increased importance of
3»
3 thermal energy diffusion While the addition of xenon decreases Le for the opposite reason. These
F7: Le variations lead to helium/air mixtures having cooler ﬂames than xenon/air mixtures. Law
0
g (1982) has suggested that Le variations can be considered as effectively changing the mass
é fraction of oxidizer in the ambient by the multiplicative factor 1/Le. As such, it is reasonable to
08
j; expect that the limiting oxygen index (LOI), i.e., the minimum oxygen mole fraction that allows
><
é quasi-steady combustion, should be larger for helium-air mixtures than for xenon-air mixtures,
,9
g; and in fact this is What experiments have shown both With drop tower experiments (Shaw and
E Wei, 2012; Shaw and Wei, 2011) as well as With the present 188 experiments.
The oxygen Lewis number has been shown Via analytical results to be an important factor in
determining extinction characteristics as well as the onset of spherically-symmetric droplet ﬂame
oscillations, especially When signiﬁcant radiant heat losses are present (Cheatham and Matalon,
1996b; Cheatham and Matalon, 1996a). This has also been shown to be the case for candle

"
"5","ﬂames in reduced gravity (Dietrich et a1., 2000). By diluting air with either helium or xenon in
the present experiments, we have investigated Lewis number effects while keeping the adiabatic
ﬂame temperature the same for a given mole fraction of the diluent gas (helium or xenon).
Other researchers have investigated inert gas substitution effects in reduced gravity droplet
combustion (Yozgatligil et a1., 2007; Park et a1., 2008; Bae and Avedisian, 2007; MC. Hicks,
% 2007; MC. Hicks, 2009). The present experiments are different from these other efforts in that
g we progressively dilute air with 21 diluent gas, i.e., the amount of diluent gas was increased
é between droplet combustion experiments, and we also employ either xenon or helium as a
g diluent. It is also noted that the present 188 experiments were preceded by drop tower
>‘
g experiments that investigated smaller droplets, initially about 1mm in diameter, because of
F7: limited reduced-gravity times (Shaw and Wei, 2012; Shaw and Wei, 2011). The present 188
g experiments allow for larger droplets to be burned, which enables size-dependent phenomena
i such as radiant heat losses to be studied.

ﬁber-supported (tethered) droplets inside of a pressure chamber. The present work, however,
examines only the combustion of free-ﬂoating droplets. The gas composition and pressure inside
the chamber are controlled and droplets of different initial compositions can be burned. The

Q
The present research was carried out mainly through the analysis of backlit droplet images and
radiometer data. Each experiment has an associated set of images captured by digital cameras.
These sets of images show the evolution of the droplet in each experiment at 30 frame/s. Droplet
edges could generally be seen very clearly in the images. Representative backlit droplet images
are shown in Fig. 3.

"
"7","The processing of image sequences is automated using a code (Aharon et al., 2013) written in the

MATLAB computer language. Properties such as droplet diameter and droplet centroid location

are evaluated for a region of interest (ROI). As opposed to using edge detection techniques,

converting each ROI directly into a binary image based on a global intensity threshold T was

sufﬁcient in most cases to separate the droplet from the background. Calculation of T is achieved
2 using Otsu’s method (Otsu, 1979). To generate a binary image from the ROI, all pixels having an
:3 intensity value greater than or equal to T are assigned an intensity value 0 and all other pixels are
g assigned an intensity value of 1. From the binary image, the droplet is identiﬁed as being the
h
E connected region With the maximum number of pixels With an intensity value of 0. Quantities
E?
E such as droplet diameter and centroid location can be calculated once the droplet in the binary
E image has been identiﬁed. The droplet area for instance, can be obtained, simply by counting the
g total number of pixels Np, Within the droplet shadow multiplied by the area of an individual
é pixel, Ap. This yields (12 = 4NpAp/Tc for the square of the diameter, d, of an equivalent droplet. A
g schematic of the image-proeessing algorithm is shown in Fig. 4.
E For estimates of burning rates K = - d(d2)/dt, the method of local polynomial ﬁtting (Fan
g; and Gijbels, 1995) was used. The local polynomial method minimizes the obj ective function (E)

Here, N is the total number of data points, t is the particular time Where the ﬁt is being applied, 11
is the order of the polynomial, k is the kernel, and h is the bandwidth. For these analyses a

"
"8","Gaussian kernel was used. The bandwidth h is an adjustable parameter that essentially allows for
multi-resolution analysis. Small values of h will cause the ﬁt to more closely follow ﬂuctuations
in the data while increasing h will smooth the ﬁt by ﬁltering out shorter-timesoale ﬂuctuations in
the data.
The function loopol (Cabrera, 2012) in the computer language R (R Core Team, 2014),
g was employed to evaluate local polynomials for d2 and K as a function of t. These burning rates
g were determined locally, i.e., as functions of time, and not simply as slopes of straight-line best

g Differences between the loopol ﬁt and the experimental (12 data are small for the h values
F7: considered (Fig. 5a). Burning rate histories (Fig. 5b) show more sensitivity to the bandwidth,
é however, but there is less scatter as h is increased. The reason for this is that increasing the
g bandwidth smooths the curve ﬁt (F ig. 5a). F igure 5b suggests that h = 0.5 s and h = 1 s provide
0?: reasonably smooth estimates of the burning rate history and for the results presented herein we

é used h = 1 s. The value h = 0.1 s includes short timescale ﬂuctuations in the data, which are
,9
g; likely from noise because rapid ﬂuctuations in K were not expected in the ISS experiments.
E Further details about the data analyses are available elsewhere (Shaw, 2014; Yu and Shaw, 2014;
Shaw and Yu, 2014), where it is shown that droplet diameters can typically be measured to
within about 0.1 mm (95% conﬁdence) and droplet burning rates to within about 0.005 mmZ/s
(95% conﬁdence).

"9","3. Results
Methanol Droplets
Methanol droplet size histories depended signiﬁcantly upon the diluent as well as the
:2 values of the diluent mole fraction XD and d0. Figure 6a shows data for dz/do2 vs. t/do2 for
o
:3 air/helium environments at 1 atm and Fig. 6b shows corresponding K vs. t/do2 data. Figures 7a
g and 7b show analogous data for air/xenon environments at 1 atm. The droplet size data in Fig. 6a
E show that for a helium mole fraction of 0.15, a droplet burns until d2/d02 reaches a value of about
E» 0.2 at Which time the droplet ﬂame extinguishes. As the helium mole fraction is increased, the
E value of d2/d02 at the time of extinction increases. Eventually a helium mole fraction is reached
3 Where quasisteady combustion is no longer possible because the ambient oxygen mole fraction is
cc
é too low and the droplet extinguishes shortly after the igniters are retracted — this corresponds to
g the LOI. In the present experiments, the LOI at 1 atm was about 0.14 for methanol droplets in
§ air/helium environments (Dietrich et a1., 2013).
E
E The buming-rate data in Fig. 6b show that for helium mole fractions of 0.2 or less, K
o
E values initially increase rapidly just after ignition and then decrease slowly, followed by rather
sudden decreases to small burning rates that correspond With extinction. The slow decrease in
burning rates after the initial ignition transient, Which we term the quasisteady combustion
period, has been reasoned to be related to water absorption by methanol droplets (Marehese and
Dryer, 1996). Interestingly, these quasisteady burning rates show little overall dependence on the

"
"10","helium mole fraction for helium mole fractions of 0.2 or less. The quasisteady burning period is
smaller for larger helium mole fractions and is nonexistent for a helium mole fraction of 0.40.
The droplet—size data for air/xenon environments (Fig. 7a) have both similarities and
differences with the air/helium data (Fig. 6a). As the mole fraction of xenon increases, the dZ/do2
value where extinction occurs also increases. Unlike air/helium environments, however, droplets
% in air/xenon environments were observed to burn with xenon mole fractions as large as 0.69,

S Burnlng-rate data for a1r/xenon enV1ronments (Flg. 7b) are somewhat s1m11ar to
E air/helium environments in that there is generally a period where the quasisteady burning rate

g strongly as the xenon mole fraction was increased. This is a result of the different transport
E properties of helium and xenon, e.g., helium has a higher thermal conductivity than xenon and
E helium will increase mass transfer rates while xenon will have the opposite effects. It is also

8 combustion. These larger xenon mole fractions would have inﬂuenced burning rates more
strongly than for helium.
Figure 8 shows radiometer data for air/xenon environments at 1 atm and 0.7 atm. The
initial spikes in the radiometer readings observed in Fig. 8 are indicative of the hot-wire igniters
being energized, then subsequently retracted from the droplet. The rapid decrease on the tail end

"
"11","of a number of the radiometer readings shown in Fig. 7 corresponds to droplet ﬂame
extinguishment. The 1-atm data in Fig. 8a show the inﬂuence of do on the radiant heat loss rate
from the droplet ﬂame, de. In Fig. 8a for instance, under the condition where methanol was
burned with xenon mole fractions greater than or equal to 0.5, ﬂame extinguishment at a given
xenon mole fraction occurs at smaller values of t/do2 as do increases. In the case where the

g xenon mole fraction is 0.67 for example, ﬂame extinguishment occurs at t/d02=0.75 s/mm2 for

(\l

:5: the d0=2.38 mm droplet in Fig. 8a. For the smaller d0=1.54mm droplet, also burned under the

o

g same 0.67 xenon mole fraction condition, ﬂame extinguishment occurs at t/d02=2.25 s/mm2.

g fraction, under conditions where methanol was burned with xenon mole fractions below 0.5.

i It is also worth noting in Fig. 8a that there are oscillations in the radiometer readings for

<53 large methanol droplets (do > 3mm) burning under air/xenon environments with xenon mole

5% fractions equal to 0.5. These oscillations have a period of about 1.5 seconds. Digital

g; enhancements of ﬂame images indicate that these oscillations correspond to a cyclical shrinking

E and expanding of the reaction zone along a roughly spherical surface from one side of the droplet
to the other. These oscillations of the reaction zone are similar to those observed for an n-
heptane droplet burned in air, pictured in Figure 12. Based on the camera frame rate, the droplet
ﬂame oscillations observed in the enhanced images also have periods that appear to closely
match the period in the oscillating radiometer data. It is noted that similar behaviors have been
reported for methanol droplets burning in air/helium environments (Dietrich et al., 2013), though

"
"12","this publication did not present radiometer data that could be correlated with the ﬂame
oscillations.

The 0.7-atm data in Fig. 8b, show that at a given xenon mole fraction, methanol droplet
ﬂame extinguishment appears to occur at smaller values of t/do2 with decreasing do and
furthermore, this trend is valid across the xenon mole fractions 03 to 0.6. In contrast to Fig. 8a,

% where it was observed that larger droplets extinguished at earlier values of t/do2 compared to
c)

g smaller droplets, this observation is reversed in Fig. 8b. The data shown in Table 2 show that the
g differences between the values of t/do2 at extinction (at a given mole fraction of Xe) for the
g experiments shown in Fig. 8b are of the order of 0.2 to 0.4 mmz/s. For comparison, uncertainties
B»

E in t/do2 at extinction are estimated to be in the range 0.1 to 0.3 mmz/s based on uncertainties in
F7: the time and droplet size measurements. Because the variations in t/dO2 at extinction are similar
0

8 enhanced images conﬁrmed the period of droplet ﬂame oscillations matched the period in the

oscillating radiometer data shown in Fig. 8b.

"
"13","Heptane Droplets
Heptane droplet combustion experiments in air/helium and air/xenon environments were
also conducted; droplet diameter and burning rate histories for these experiments are presented in
Figs. 9 and 10. Similar to the methanol droplet experiments described previously, the same is
to true with the heptane experiments in that as the diluent mole fraction increases, the value of d2/
2 do2 at extinction also increases. A noticeable difference however, is that the slow decrease in
8
g burning rates observed during quasi-steady combustion of methanol droplets is not apparent with
(\1
§- heptane droplets; this is indicative of the different fuel characteristics between methanol and
E heptane. As shown in Fig. 9, the burning rates of heptane droplets in air/xenon environments,
E more or less, remain constant during quasi-steady combustion, and then rapidly drop due to
E extinction. Also, from comparison of Figs. 9 and 10, it can be concluded that helium is a better
i ﬂame suppressant than xenon for heptane droplets; this was also true with methanol droplets as
:3 well. As shown in Table 1, the LOI for heptane in air/xenon environments is <0.11, versus 0.15
<:
g in air/helium environments (Dietrich et a1., 2014). Again, this difference is attributed to the Le

3:
2
E The radiometer data for heptane droplet combustion in air/xenon environments at 1-atm
Q and 0.7-atm are shown in Fig. 11a and b, respectively. As opposed to the radiometer data for
methanol, shown in Fig. 8, the data in Fig. 11 do not indicate the presence of ﬂame oscillations
for n-heptane droplets burned in air/xenon environments at 0.7-atm and 1-atm. In fact, there were
110 ﬂame oscillations observed in the current n-heptane experiments for both air/xenon and

"
"14","air/helium environments. Flame oscillations were observed, however, in the present experiments
where n-heptane droplets were burned in pure air (see Fig. 12).
Secondary (0001 ﬂame) combustion of n-heptane droplets burning in air/xenon was also
clearly noted for droplets with do > 1.5 mm. In these cases, radiometer data suggest that n-
heptane droplets can continue to burn even though the Visible droplet ﬂame has extinguished, as
% shown in Figure 13. The radiometer data in Fig. 13 decreases rapidly after the point of visible
0)
g ﬂame extinction, but remains at a non-zero value for quite some time (e.g. greater than 20
E seconds), indicative of low temperature chemical reactions as reported elsewhere (Nayagam et
g a1., 2012; Farouk and Dryer, 2014).

g The diluent levels were increased in the ISS experiments until droplets could no longer

'5
:3 droplets, and LOI < 0.11 for n-heptane droplets, also burned in air/xenon mixtures at 1 atm.
Q
E Furthermore, drop tower experiments with methanol and n-heptane droplets have provided LOI
ranges for smaller droplets. These data are listed in Table 1 for air/helium and air/xenon
environments.
The data in Table 1 show that the LOI values are about the same for the initial droplet
sizes investigated. In general the LOI eXists where chemical kinetic heat release rates cannot

"
"15","overcome heat losses from the reaction zone. For small initial droplet sizes, heat losses will be
dominated by molecular diffusion but for large initial droplet sizes the heat losses will be
dominated by radiation. Droplets will extinguish if they are too large or too small and there will
eXist ambients where quasisteady droplet combustion is not even possible (Chao et al., 1991).
Urzay et al. (2009) provided an analysis of combustion of spinning disks with surface radiative

2 heat losses. They found that diffusive losses were dominant for small disk length scales, radiant

(\l

3-: losses were dominant at large disk length scales, and there was an intermediate disk length scale

g where the disks were most resistant to extinction. It is reasonable to assume that the same trend

5

E will eXist with droplet LOI data in that there will be an intermediate droplet size that determines

E?

E“ the LOI. Because we did not observe a signiﬁcant variation in the LOI with droplet size, the

E inﬂuence of droplet size may be small. It is also noted that we have assumed that heat losses are

g dominant in determining the LOI, i.e., the so-called ""cool ﬂame"" chemistry associated with 11-

% heptane droplet combustion in reduced gravity is assumed to be negligible.

TE Multistage Combustion

E“

E The 188 experiments under investigation exhibited multistage combustion behaVior for 11-

cc

é heptane droplets; this phenomenon, however, was not observed with methanol droplets. In both

Q cases, there could be an early period after ignition where Vigorous gasiﬁcation would occur with
a typical hot ﬂame being present. Eventually, however, this hot ﬂame would disappear from the
images where the droplet would still be gasifying vigorously, but more slowly than when the
ﬂame was Visible. For n-heptane droplets, radiometer signals would indicate that there were still
hot gases present even after Visible ﬂame extinction, suggesting that heat-releasing chemical

"
"16","reactions were still occurring. In the case of n-heptane droplets, it has been reasoned that the
ﬂame of a large droplet can be cooled because of radiant heat losses, leading to high-temperature
chemical reactions becoming negligible with the combustion then being dominated by low-
temperature ""cool ﬂame"" reactions (Nayagam et al., 2012; Farouk and Dryer, 2014).
The experiments with large methanol droplets could appear to exhibit multistage

5 Flame oscillations were sometimes observed in the ISS experiments. These oscillations,
which have also been noted in other long-duration microgravity experiments, e.g., with candles
(Dietrich et al., 2000), involved what appeared to be extinction of the ﬂame that would start
locally at a small region on the Visible ﬂame surface. This extinction region would grow in size
such that the Visible ﬂame became essentially a spherical cap. After reaching a certain location,
the ﬂame would traverse back along the path of the extinction, but the ﬂame would not generally

"
"17","become spherical again, i.e., there could be a ﬁnite-sized region where the ﬂame was not present.
This cycle could repeat several times. In some cases, the ﬂame would eventually extinguish but
in others, the oscillations would diminish in amplitude until steady conditions were achieved.
The ﬂame oscillations generally occurred with droplets that had a small drift velocity. In
the frame of reference of a droplet, the ﬂame appeared to ﬁrst locally extinguish downstream of
g the droplet. The extinction zone would grow in size, with an extinction wave traveling upstream
c)
g along basically a spherical surface. Following this, as described above, a ﬂame front could travel
g in the opposite direction, again along a spherical surface, towards the rear of the droplet, with the
g cycle sometimes repeating. The local extinction behind a droplet may be related to a deﬁciency
3;.
E of oxygen as well as enhanced radiative heat losses from hot gases in this region and the
F7: subsequent ﬂame propagation may be related to replenishment of oxygen as well as cooling of
o
g the gases behind a droplet, which leads to reduced radiant heat losses. The transport of species
é associated with radiant heat losses, i.e., H20 and C02, away from the initial extinction zone

K

§
E It was generally the case that the oscillations appeared when oxygen levels were low and
8 the ﬂames were dim and difﬁcult to image. However, the radiometer data could clearly show that
ﬂame oscillations were present even when the ﬂame imaging system could not. When ﬂames
were Visible, the radiometer data show ﬂuctuations that correlate with droplet ﬂame shape

atm), radiometer ﬂuctuations were observed only for large droplets with do > 3mm.

T0 the best of our knowledge, there have not been any models published related to
multidimensional oscillations of droplet ﬂames such as those we have observed in the ISS
experiments. There have been, however, models that considered spherically-symmetric droplet

The ﬂammability and extinction of methanol droplets differ signiﬁcantly in air/xenon
ambients compared to air/helium ambients. The experimental results in this study indicate that
LOI = 0.14 for methanol droplets burning in air/helium ambients, while LOI < 0.065 in air/xenon
ambients. These variations are due to differences in transport properties and are accounted for
with the oxygen Lewis number. Addition of helium in the air/helium ambients increases Le

"
"19","because of the increased importance of thermal energy diffusion from the ﬂame zone while the
addition of xenon decreases Le. A potential area for future research would be to conduct
additional reduoe-graVity combustion experiments of methanol droplets in air/xenon
environments so that the LOI can be attained for this fuel.
The radiometer data for methanol droplets show ﬂuctuations that correlate with droplet
% ﬂame shape oscillations. Fluctuations in radiometer data for methanol droplets in air/xenon have

g a period of about 1.5 seconds at 1 atm, and 1-2 seconds at 0.7 atm. In both instances (e.g. 1 atm
g and 0.7 atm), radiometer ﬂuctuations were observed only for large droplets with do > 3mm.

<:
E Similar to methanol, the ﬂammability of n-heptane also differs in air/xenon and air/helium
E environments. Here, the LOI = 0.15 and is < 0.11 for n-heptane droplets burned in air/helium and
c)
3; air/xenon ambient, respectively. As opposed to methanol, no radiometer or droplet ﬂame
8 ﬂuctuations were observed for any of the present n-heptane droplet experiments, where xenon
and helium were used as diluents. Radiometer ﬂuctuations were observed for n-heptane droplets
burning in pure air however. The experimental data also suggest that n-heptane droplets with do
> 1.5 mm could undergo low temperature chemistry and continue burning even after the Visible
droplet ﬂame has extinguished.
