This paper introduces a video database reduced from the handheld capillary ﬂow contact line experiments
completed aboard the International Space Station during expeditions 9—16, August 2004—N0vember 2007. The
simple ﬂuid interface experiments quantify the uncertain impact of the boundary condition at the contact line: the
region where liquid, gas, and solid meet. This region controls many signiﬁcant static and dynamic characteristics of
the large length scale capillary phenomena critical to multiphase ﬂuids management systems aboard spacecraft.
Differences in ﬂuid behavior of nearly identical static interfaces to nearly identical perturbations are attributed
primarily to differences in ﬂuid physics in the vicinity of the contact line. Free and pinned contact lines, large and
small contact angles, and linear and nonlinear perturbations are tested for several manually imparted perturbation
types (i.e., axial, slosh, and other modes) to right circular cylinders. The video and sample digitized datasets are made
publicly available for model benchmarking. As a demonstration of the utility of the database, and in parallel with the
experimental effort, blind numerical predictions of the dynamic interface response to the experimentally applied
input perturbations are offered as an example of current capabilities to predict such phenomena. The agreement and
lack of agreement between the experiments and numerics is a guide to improve or verify current analytical methods
to predict such phenomena critical to practical spacecraft ﬂuid systems design.
