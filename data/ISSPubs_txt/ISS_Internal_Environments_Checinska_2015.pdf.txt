Abstract
Background: The International Space Station (ISS) is a unique built environment due to the effects of microgravity,
space radiation, elevated carbon dioxide levels, and especially continuous human habitation. Understanding the
composition of the ISS microbial community will facilitate further development of safety and maintenance
practices. The primary goal of this study was to Characterize the viable microbiome of the lSS—built environment.
A second objective was to determine if the built environments of Earth—based Cleahrooms associated with space
exploration are an appropriate model of the ISS environment.
Results: Samples collected from the ISS and two Cleahrooms at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL, Pasadena, CA)
were analyzed by traditional cultivation, adenosine triphosphate (ATP), and propidium monoazide—quahtitative
polymerase chain reaction (PMA—qPCR) assays to estimate viable microbial populations. The 168 rRNA gene Illumiha
iTag sequencing was used to elucidate microbial diversity and explore differences between ISS and Cleahroom
microbiomes. Statistical analyses showed that members of the phyla Actinobacteria, Firmicutes, ahd Proteobacteria
were dominant in the samples examined but varied in abundance. Actinobacteria were predominant in the ISS
samples whereas Proteobacteria, least abundant in the ISS, dominated in the Cleahroom samples. The viable
bacterial populations seen by PIViA treatment were greatly decreased. However, the treatment did not appear to
have an effect on the bacterial composition (diversity) associated with each sampling site.
Conclusions: The results of this study provide strong evidence that specific human skih—associated microorganisms
make a substantial contribution to the ISS microbiome, which is hot the case in Earth—based Cleahrooms. For
example, Corynebacter/um ahd Prop/‘on/‘bacter/‘um (Actinobacteria) but not Staphylococcus (Firmicutes) species are
dominant on the ISS in terms of viable and total bacterial community composition. The results obtained will
facilitate future studies to determine how stable the ISS environment is over time. The present results also
demonstrate the value of measuring viable cell diversity and population size at any sampling site. This information
can be used to identify sites that can be targeted for more stringent Cleahihg. Finally, the results will allow
comparisons with other built sites and facilitate future improvements on the ISS that will ensure astronaut health.
