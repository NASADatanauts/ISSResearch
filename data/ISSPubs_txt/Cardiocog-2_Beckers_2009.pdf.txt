Abstract

After spaceﬂight, astronauts sometimes suffer a variable degree of reduced orthostatic tolerance. Although many studies have
addressed this problem, many aspects remain unclear. Also, it is unknown how long the cardiovascular system needs to recover
from short duration spaceﬂights.

The scope of the present study was to determine a long-term follow-up of cardiovascular control up to 25 days after spaceﬂight
under control conditions in ﬁve astronauts using heart rate variability, blood pressure variability and baroreﬂeX sensitivity (BRS)
indices.

In standing position heart rate after spaceﬂight was signiﬁcantly higher compared with pre-ﬂight (R+1: 99 (SD 9) BPM vs
L-30: 77 (SD 3) BPM; p < 0.001). At the same time high frequency modulation of heart rate was extremely depressed (R+1:
70 (SD 334) ms2 vs L-30: 271 (SD 68) msz; p < 0.01), as was BRS: (R+1: 5 (SD 1) vs L-30: 10 (SD 2) ms/mmHg, p < 0.05).
These changes had largely recovered after 4 days upon return to Earth. Orthostatic blood pressure control was well maintained
from the ﬁrst day after landing.

The decrease in BRS and in vagal heart rate modulation following short-duration spaceﬂight appear to constitute an adequate
autonomic neural response to restored gravity. After 4 days upon return to Earth, vagal heart rate modulation is almost completely
recovered to the pre-ﬂight level. The ﬁndings of the present study demonstrate that the decrease in vagal heart rate modulation in
standing position should not be characterised as some kind of cardiovascular deconditioning, but rather as the normal response
to orthostatic stress after spaceﬂight.
