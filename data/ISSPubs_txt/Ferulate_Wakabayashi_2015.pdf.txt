detailed online in the guide for authors. Plant cell walls are composed of a variety of polysaccharides, proteins, and phenolic com-
pounds. Based on the differences in matrix polysaccharide composition, plant cell walls are
divided into two groups, type I and type II wall [5]. Gramineous (cereal) plants such as rice,
Wheat, maize, oat, and barley have the type II wall, While most other monocotyledons and
dicotyledons have the type I wall [5]. The type I wall contains a large amount of pectic poly-
mers, such as rhamnogalacturonans and arabinogalactans, and xyloglucans. On the other
hand, the type II wall contains only a small amount of pectic polymers and xyloglucans, but a
large amount of arabinoxylans and [3-1,3:1,4-g1ucans (B-glucans). In addition to cell wall poly-
saccharides, the type II wall contains a signiﬁcant amount of phenolic acid monomers such as
ferulic acid (FA) and p-coumaric acid, Which are ester-linked to arabinoxylans [6, 7]. Of these
monomers, some FA residues undergo a coupling reaction to produce diferulic acid (DFA),
Which forms cross-links between arabinoxylans, the major matrix polysaccharides of the type
II wall [8, 9]. The ferulate network (cross-linkage of matriX polysaccharides by DFA) forms a
tight network Within the architecture of the cell wall [5, 10]. DFA and FA levels have indeed
been shown to inﬂuence the regulation of cell wall strength in gramineous plants [11—16].

Several biochemical steps are involved in the formation of the ferulate network. In shoots of
oat, rice, maize, and Wheat, the DFA content Changed in parallel With the FA content [11—14],
suggesting that the rate of the DFA formation is largely dependent on the amount of FA in cell
walls. Hydroxycinnamate monomers, including FA and also p-coumaric acid, are synthesized
in the cytoplasm Via the phenylpropanoid pathway, and phenylalanine ammonia-lyase (PAL)
catalyzes the ﬁrst step of the pathway and plays a rate-limiting role in it [17]. Indeed, the
Change in PAL activity Closely correlated With the rate of increase in the amount of wall-bound
FA in some gramineous shoots [13—15]. In addition to the amount of wall-bound FA, the cou-
pling process of FA, catalyzed by cell wall-bound peroxidase (CW-PRX), is functionally impor-
tant in the mechanism of DFA formation [10, 18]. Treatment of maize suspension cells With
hydrogen peroxide activated apoplastic peroxidases and thus stimulated the DFA formation
[8]. Furthermore, the promotion of DFA formation was found to be Closely associated With the
increase in CW-PRX activity in segments of oat shoots [19]. We found that an increase in DFA
content was found to be Closely correlated With increased CW-PRX activity in rice shoots [20].
Therefore, both PAL and CW-PRX play key roles and are deeply involved in the mechanism in
regulation of ferulate network formation in gramineous shoots.

We have previously studied the effects of gravity on cell wall properties in plant organs
using centrifugation techniques. Centrifugation produces conditions of hypergravity, i.e., the
gravitational forces of more than 1 g. Hypergravity treatment has been shown to increase the
rigidity (mechanical strength) of cell walls [21, 22]. In terms of the chemical properties of cell
walls, continuous hypergravity treatment (300 g for 2—4 (1) stimulated the formation of ferulate
networks Within the cell wall architecture of dark-grown Wheat shoots [23]. Furthermore,
hypergravity treatment increased the activity of CW-PRX in the stem tissues of azuki bean

seedlings [24]. These results suggest that a hypergraVity environment increases CW-PRX activ-
ity in stem tissues of terrestrial plants and that in case of gramineous plants, such an increase in
CW-PRX activity may stimulate ferulate network formation, resulting in making the ﬁrm cell
wall structure against the increased gravitational force. From these ﬁndings, we hypothesized
that, in contrast to hypergravity, an environment of microgravity may reduce the formation of
hydroxycinnamate cross-links in gramineous cell walls by affecting activities of enzymes such
as PAL and CW-PRX. We carried out a space experiment called Ferulate to examine above
hypothesis. In this experiment, we compared the properties of rice shoots grown in space
under artificial 1 g and microgravity conditions; experiment was conducted at the Cell Biology
Experiment Facility (CBEF) 0n the International Space Station (188).
Materials and Methods
Plant materials
Rice (Oryza sativa L., CV. Koshihikari) was used for the experiment. Three days before the
launch, rice caryopses were sterilized in 5% (V/V) sodium hypochlorite solution for 1 h and
then thoroughly washed with sterilized water. Twenty-ﬁve sterilized caryopses were aligned
along a groove on 11 mL of 1% (w/V) agar (Bacto Agar, BD, NJ, USA) in a black polycarbonate
culture dish (W X D X H = 40 x 40 X 30 mm, outer dimensions) that shaded caryopses from
light irradiation. We prepared 48 culture dishes. After planting, culture dishes were stored in a
Measurement Experiment Unit (MEU) and kept at 2—4°C before and during the ﬂight, until
the start of the growth experiment on the 188. One MEU contained 12 culture dishes. In the
preliminary experiment, we checked that the storage at 2—4°C prevented germination of
planted rice caryopses for one month and that cold-stored caryopses kept their ability to germi-
nate and grow during the storage period. Pictures of culture dish and experimental devices
(MEU and CBEF) used in the experiment are shown in SI Fig
Onboard procedures
Four MEUs containing rice caryopses were launched aboard Space Shuttle STS-132 on May 15,
2010. In orbit, the MEUs were stored in the Minus-Eighty Laboratory Freezer for 188 (MELFI)
at 2°C. Twelve days after the launch, the MEUs were removed and transferred to the CBEF 0f
the Kibo Module. The CBEF is an incubator with two compartments: a microgravity part and
an artiﬁcial gravity part, in which a centrifuge produces 1 g conditions [25]. The CBEF has
been shown to regulate thermal environment accurately and has already been used in space
experiments on the 188 [25]. Two MEUs were placed in the microgravity compartment of the
CBEF (microgravity conditions) and two were attached to the centrifuge in the artificial gravity
compartment, which was rotated to produce acceleration at 1 g (artiﬁcial 1 g conditions) (SI
Fig). Temperature inside the CBEF was increased to 225°C under microgravity conditions for
culture dishes in both compartments. Rotation was started when the temperature inside the
MEUs reached 20°C. The temperature of culture dishes increased at the same rate in the micro-
gravity and artiﬁcial gravity compartments, reaching 20°C and 226°C at around 100 min and
3 h, respectively, after being transferred to the CBEF (S2 Fig). The caryopses were allowed to
germinate and grown in darkness for 99 h (4 d), 127 h (5.3 d), or 136 h (5.6 d) at 22.6i0.1°C.
At the end of each culture period, eight of culture dishes for each gravity condition were taken
out of the MEU, immediately transferred to the MELFI and stored at -80°C. The samples were
brought back to earth aboard Space Shuttle STS-133 on March 9, 2011, and transported to the
laboratory at Osaka City University. Seedlings were kept frozen during the ﬂight and transpor-
tation t0 the laboratory and were stored at -80°C until the analysis.

Measurement of mechanical properties of the cell wall
Shoots consisting of the coleoptile and ﬁrst leaf were eXCised from the frozen rice seedlings.
EXCised shoots were immediately boiled for 10 min in 80% (V/V) ethanol and then stored in
fresh 80% ethanol until analysis. Before the mechanical properties of the cell wall were mea-
sured, the ethanol-fixed shoots were rehydrated for several hours at room temperature in seV-
eral Changes of water. The lengths of shoots were then measured with a ruler. The mechanical
properties of the cell wall were measured according to the stress-relaxation method using a ten-
sile tester (RTM-25, Toyo Baldwin, Tokyo, Japan). The subapical region of the shoot (2—3 mm
below the tip) was ﬁxed between two Clamps 2 mm apart, and stretched by lowering the bottom
Clamp at a speed of 20 mm min’1 until a load of 10 g was achieved. A stress-relaxation parame-
ter, minimum stress-relaxation time (T0), was calculated according to the equation of Yama-
moto et a1. [26].
Fractionation of cell wall components
The ethanol-ﬁxed shoots were rehydrated and the cell wall components fractionated following
the method in Wakabayashi et a1. [14]. Rehydrated shoots were homogenized in water, washed
successively with water, acetone and a methanolzchloroform mixture (1:1, V/V), and treated
with 2 units mL’1 porcine pancreatic oc-amylase (type I-A, Sigma, St. Louis, MO, USA) in
50 mM sodium acetate buffer (pH 6.5) at 37°C for 3 h. After the amylase treatment, the cell
walls were treated with 0.1 M NaOH for 24 h and then with 1 M NaOH for 24 h, in darkness at
room temperature under N2, to extract ester-linked phenolic acids [27]. Thereafter, the residual
cell wall material was extracted in three times (8 h each) with 17.5% NaOH containing 0.02%
NaBH4 at room temperature. The fraction extracted with 17.5% NaOH was neutralized with
acetic acid. After cell wall-bound phenolics had been extracted from the 0.1 and 1 M NaOH
solutions (described below), the remaining solution was combined with the 17.5% NaOH
extracts. This mixture was designated the matrix polysaccharide fraction. The alkali-insoluble
residue (cellulose fraction) was washed successively with 0.03 M acetic acid and ethanol, dried
at 40°C, dissolved in 72% sulfuric acid for 1 h at room temperature, and diluted with a 29-fold
volume of water. The sugar content in each fraction was determined by the phenol-sulfuric
acid method [28] using glucose as the standard.
Determination of cell waII-bound phenolic constituents
Ester-linked phenolic acids liberated from the cell wall with 0.1 and 1 M NaOH solutions (see
above) were extracted three times with ethyl acetate after acidifying the alkali extracts to pH 3
with HCl [20]. The ethyl acetate extracts derived from the 0.1 and 1 M NaOH solutions were
combined and dried. The dried samples were stored in darkness at -20°C. The liberated
phenolic acids were analyzed using a high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) sys-
tem (LC-6A, Shimadzu, Kyoto, Japan) equipped with an Inertsil ODS-3 column (4.6 X 250
mm, GL Science Inc, Tokyo, Japan) and a photodiode array detector (SPD-M20A, Shimadzu)
following the method described by Parr et a1. [29] and Waldron et a1. [27]. Samples were eluted
with methanol at a linearly increasing concentration of 10—73% in 5 mM triﬂuoroacetic acid
(approximately pH 4). Phenolic acid monomers were identiﬁed and quantiﬁed using trans-
ferulic acid and trans-p-coumaric acid as standards (Wako Pure Chemical Industries, Ltd.,
Osaka, Japan). DFA isomer peaks were identiﬁed and quantiﬁed using 5—5’—DFA, synthesized
according to the method described by Richtzenhain [30], and published spectra and response
factors reported by Waldron et a1. [27].

Lignin content was determined according to the method of Kamisaka et a1. [11]. The alkali-

insoluble residue (cellulose fraction) was prepared as described above. The dried residue was

dissolved in 2 mL of 25% (V/V) acetyl bromide in glacial acetic acid and kept at 70°C for
30 min. After cooling to room temperature, 2 mL of 2 M NaOH solution was added. The miX-
ture was centrifuged at 1,000 g for 10 min, after which 0.2 mL of 7.5 M hydroxylamine was
added to the supernatant. The amount of lignin was determined by measuring the absorbance
of the ﬁnal solution at 280 nm. Authentic lignin (Tokyo Kasei Kogyo Co. Ltd., Tokyo) was
used as the standard.
PAL and CW- RX

Activity assays. After excising, shoots were immediately frozen with liquid nitrogen and
kept at -80°C until use. The activities of PAL and CW-PRX were assayed following the method
in Wakabayashi et a1. [14, 20, 24]. The frozen shoots (ca. 40—100 mg) were homogenized in a
mortar with ice-cold 100 mM potassium borate buffer (pH 8.8) containing 2 mM mercap-
toethanol and centrifuged at 10,000 g for 10 min at 4°C. After centrifugation, PAL actiVity was
assayed using the supernatant. The reaction mixture (2 mL) contained 0.5 mL of 4 mM L-phe-
nylalanine, 0.5 mL of extract, and 1 mL of 100 mM potassium borate buffer (pH 8.8). The reac-
tion mixture was incubated at 37°C for 60 min, after which the reaction was terminated by
adding 0.1 mL of 5 N HCl to the mixture. The mixture was then subjected to extraction with
ethyl acetate three times. The extract was dried and kept in darkness at -20°C. The amount of
t-cinnamic acid produced by PAL was determined using the HPLC and solvent system
described above. Enzyme actiVity was expressed as the amount of t-cinnamic acid produced
after 1 h of incubation. The protein content in the extract was determined using an assay kit
(Protein Assay Kit, Bio-Rad Lab. Inc., Hercules, CA).

For the CW-PRX actiVity assay, the frozen shoots were homogenized in a mortar with ice-
cold 10 mM sodium phosphate buffer (pH 7.0). Cell wall residues were collected on a polypro-
pylene mesh (32 pm pore size) and thoroughly washed with the same buffer. The washed resi-
dues were suspended in 10 mM sodium phosphate buffer (pH 6.0) containing 1.5 M NaCl. The
suspension was kept for 24 h at 4°C and then centrifuged at 10,000 g for 20 min at 4°C. The
supernatant was used for the assay. CW-PRX actiVity was measured using two substrates,
guaiacol and FA. For guaiacol, the reaction mixture (2 mL) contained 100 pL of enzyme prepa-
ration, 13 mM guaiacol, and 5 mM hydrogen peroxide in 40 mM MES-KOH buffer (pH 6.0).
The reaction was initiated by adding hydrogen peroxide at 25°C. Absorbance at 470 nm was
recorded at 15—s intervals, and enzyme actiVity was quantiﬁed as the increase in absorbance
from 1 t0 2 min after hydrogen peroxide was added. When FA was used as a substrate, the reac-
tion mixture (2 mL) contained 50 pL of enzyme preparation, 0.1 mM FA, and 5 mM hydrogen
peroxide in 50 mM sodium phosphate buffer (pH 6.0). Enzyme actiVity was quantiﬁed accord-
ing to the decrease in absorbance at 310 nm from 0.5 to 1.0 min after the addition of hydrogen
peroxide at 25°C. Protein content was determined as described above.

Quantifying CW-PRX gene expression levels. As above, frozen shoots (ca. 60—100 mg)
were homogenized using a mortar and a pestle. Total RNA was extracted using the RNeasy
Plant Mini Kit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA, USA), including a DNA elimination step (RNase-Free
DNase Set, Qiagen). cDNA was then synthesized from the RNA sample (ca. 200 11g), and then
the Cyanine 3 (Cy3)-1abe1ed RNA was synthesized with Cy3-CTP using the Low Input Quick
Amp Labeling Kit (Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA, USA) for microarray analysis. The
labeled RNA was purified, fragmented, and then hybridized onto the microarray slides (Agilent
Rice Oligo Microarray 4 X 44K, Design ID 015058, Agilent Technologies) according to the
manufacturer’s instructions. The microarray slides were scanned 0n the SureScan Microarray
Scanner System (G4900DA, Agilent Technologies). Hybridization signals (ﬂuorescence inten-
sities) 0n the arrays were analyzed with Feature Extraction Software (Agilent Technologies).

Microarray analysis was conducted on four independent replicates prepared from four culture
dishes. Class III peroxidases are speciﬁc to plants and considered as secreted extracellular pro-
teins, and the rice genome contains 138 class III peroxidase genes [31]. We therefore analyzed
the expression levels of class III peroxidase genes, using the values of ﬂuorescence intensities
obtained through a microarray analysis as described above.

In addition to the microarray analysis, the expression level of class III peroxidase genes was
analyzed by the quantitative real-time RT-PCR according to the method of Wakabayashi et a1.
[20]. Brieﬂy, single strand cDNA was synthesized from ca. 8 pg 0ft0ta1 RNA using High
Capacity cDNA Reverse Transcription Kit (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA, USA) with a
random hexamer primer. Real-time RT-PCR was performed with the Applied Biosystems 7500
Real Time PCR System with SYBR Green PCR Master MiX (Applied Biosystems) according to
the manufacturer’s instructions. A set of speciﬁc primers was designed based on the conserved
region of siX sequences of rice class III peroxidase genes [20]. Data were normalized with
respect to 18S rRNA, which was measured as an internal standard.

Statistical analysis

For each measurement, the means and the standard errors of the means (SE) were calculated.
The signiﬁcance of differences between artiﬁcial (on-orbit) 1 g and microgravity conditions
was analyzed by the Student’s paired t-test. In addition, the signiﬁcance of differences of T0 val-
ues among each gravity condition was analyzed by the Tukey’s test.

Results and Discussion

Morphology and growth

We have previously found that light irradiation can increase the amount of cell wall-bound
phenolic acids in some gramineous plants [13, 16]. Light irradiation may thus oppose and
negate the effects of microgravity 0n the formation of these phenolic acids. Therefore, to focus
on the effects solely of the gravitational environment, we used etiolated (dark-grown) seedlings
in the present experiment.

The germination rate of microgravity-grown caryopses, approximately 95%, was almost the
same as that of artiﬁcial 1 g—grown ones. Rice seedlings grown in orbit for 4 (1 under artiﬁcial
1 g and microgravity conditions are shown in Fig 1. Under artiﬁcial 1 g conditions, shoots grew
upward and roots elongated downward along the gravity vector. A similar morphology was
observed for rice seedlings grown on the ground [32], indicating that the artiﬁcial gravity enVi-
ronment in orbit mimics the 1 g (control) condition on the ground. In contrast, under micro-
gravity conditions, shoots were not straight but bent toward their caryopses and roots grew in
various directions with some emerging into the air (Fig 1). In other words, rice seedlings show
automorphogenesis under microgravity conditions in space, as previously reported [32].

Rice shoots grew substantially during the cultivation period; the lengths of shoots grown
under artificial 1 g and microgravity conditions were 6.7i0.3 and 6.3i0.3 mm at 4 d (n = 25),
12.6i0.3 and 12.7i0.3 mm at 5.3 d (n = 35), and 16.9i0.4 and 16.1i0.5 mm at 5.6 d (n = 19),
indicating that microgravity conditions barely affected elongation growth of rice shoots. In
the previous space experiment [33], elongation growth of rice coleoptiles was stimulated by
approximately 5% in space compared with on the ground, in which plants were cultivated inde-
pendently in space (in orbit) and on the ground. In contrast, the present space experiment cul-
tivated rice seedlings simultaneously in orbit under both artiﬁcial 1 g and microgravity
conditions. The discrepancy in the effect of microgravity on growth may be due to different
cultivation systems including incubators and cultivation containers, and to different cultivation
conditions such as temperature and gas environments.

In the present space experiment, we prepared 8 culture dishes (tota1200 caryopses) for each
day and each gravity condition. After the cultivation, plant materials were kept frozen in cul-
ture dish on the ISS and during the ﬂight aboard Space Shuttle and the transportation to the
laboratory. The number of recovered shoots was approximately 90% of planted caryopses for
4 d seedlings, approximately 70% for 5.3 d seedlings, and approximately 50% for 5.6 (1 seed-
lings. The 5.3 d and 5.6 (1 samples, particularly 5.6 (1 sample, contained a number of broken
shoots. The 4 d seedlings that had Short shoots did not contain broken shoots. Therefore, we
assume that the frozen long shoots may suffer physical damage (shock) during the recovery
and transportation. This problem needs a further consideration.

Mechanical properties of the cell wall

The mechanical properties of the cell wall of rice shoots were measured by the streSS-relaxation
method [26]. The To, a streSS-relaxation parameter, is associated with Viscosity according to
the theoretical Maxwell Viscoelastic model [26, 34, 35]. Therefore, T0 has been considered to
represent the Viscous nature of cell walls: an increase in T0 indicates that the cell walls have
become more Viscous 0r stiff, whereas a decrease indicates that they have become less Viscous
0r looser. Indeed, changes in To have been reported to correlate with the capacity of cell walls
to extend (cell wall loosening) in growing plant stems [34, 35].

The T0 value at 4 d of rice shoots grown under microgravity was almost comparable to that
of shoots grown under artiﬁcial 1 g conditions (Table 1). However, T0 values of microgravity-
grown shoots were signiﬁcantly lower than those of 1 g—grown shoots at both 5.3 d and 5.6 (1,
although the values increased during the cultivation period (Table 1). In addition, the analysis
of the signiﬁcance of differences among each gravity condition by the Tukey’s test Showed that
To values of 1 g— and microgravity-grown shoots Signiﬁcantly increased from 4 d to 5.3 d
(P < 0.05), but no signiﬁcant differences were observed between 5.3 d and 5.6 d. The Tukey’s
test also Showed that at both 5.3 d and 5.6 d, To values of microgravity-grown shoots were sig-
niﬁcantly lower than those of 1 g—grown shoots (P < 0.05) similar to the result of the Student's
t—test. These results suggest that shoot cell walls became stiff over the course of the growth

period and that this cell wall stiffening was suppressed in the microgravity environment. The
present results are consistent with the results of the previous space experiment, in which cell
wall extensibility remained higher in space-grown rice coleoptiles than in ground-grown ones
[33].

In the present space experiment, we initially planned to harvest plant materials at l—d inter-
vals from days 4 t0 6, but operational limitations in orbit constrained sampling to days 4, 5.3,
and 5.6. Because the duration between 5.3 d and 5.6 d was short, and because microgravity
showed similar effects on the mechanical property of cell walls at 5.3 d and 5.6 d, we used 5.3 d
shoots for the analyses of cell wall constituents and 5.6 d shoots for the analyses of enzyme
activities and of gene expression levels.

Amounts of cell wall constituents

The cell walls of growing plant tissues consist of cell wall polysaccharides, proteins and pheno-
lic substances [5]. The cell wall polysaccharides of rice shoots were fractionated into matrix
polysaccharides and cellulose (Table 2) and found to consist of 54—60% matrix polysaccharides
and 40—46% cellulose. The amount of matrix polysaccharides and cellulose increased around

3 times from 4 d to 5.3 d, and microgravity did not inﬂuence these amounts on either 4 d or
5.3 (1 (Table 2). Indeed, microgravity was previously found to barely affect the net amount
(amount per organ) of cell wall polysaccharides in rice coleoptiles [33]. Similarly, hypergravity
conditions (gravitational forces of more than 1 g) also had little effect on the net amount of cell
wall polysaccharides in stem organs, although the amount of polysaccharides per unit of stem
length was increased [23, 36].

In Type 11 cell walls (found in gramineous plants), phenolic acid monomers such as FA and
p-coumaric acid are linked by esters t0 arabinoxylans, and some FA residues undergo a

coupling reaction to produce DFA [5, 10]. Although the amount ofp-coumaric acid was about
1/20 of that of FA, both compounds increased dramatically from 4 d to 5.3 d (Fig 2). The
amounts of FA and p-coumaric acid at 4 d and 5.3 d were almost the same in sheets grown in
1 g and microgravity conditions (F ig 2), suggesting that a microgravity environment did not
affect the formation of cell wall-bound phenolic acid monomers.

Our previous study showed that the cell walls of etiolated (dark-grown) rice shoots con-
tained three major DFA isomers: 5—5, 8-0-4, and 8—5 (8—5 benzofuran) forms [20]. A similar
distribution of DFA isomers has been observed in the cell walls of wheat shoots [37, 38]. The
amounts per shoot of these three DFA isomers increased substantially from 4 d to 5.3 d (Fig 3),
as did FA content (Fig 2). The amount of DFA isomers in microgravity-grown shoots was sig-
niﬁcantly lower than in 1 g—grown sheets on 5.3 d,whi1e the amounts were almost the same in
sheets from both conditions on 4 d (Fig 3). This indicates that a microgravity environment
reduced DFA formation, that is the coupling of FA residues, in sheet cell walls. While gravita-
tional conditions did not affect the amount of cell wall polysaccharides (Table 2), the concen-
tration of DFA in cell walls was lower in microgravity-grown shoots than in 1 g—grown shoots.
In cell walls of gramineous shoots, the decrease in the amount of DFA contributes in maintain-
ing the cell wall extensible 0r loosened [12, 14, 15, 39]. Therefore, decreased ferulate network
formation probably contributes to keeping the cell wall loose under microgravity conditions.
In contrast, hypergravity treatment increased DFA content in cell walls of wheat shoots [23].

In addition to ester-linked phenolic acids, the cell walls of terrestrial plants contain lignin.
Lignin is a complex phenolic polymer with a high molecular mass and formed by the polymeri-
zation of hydroxycinnamate monomers. Lignin thus forms a complex net of cross-links among
cell wall components and secures them. Hypergravity has been shown to increase the lignin
content of stem organs [24, 40, 41]. We therefore analyzed lignin content in our space-grown
rice shoots. As shown in Table 3, the lignin content increased dramatically from 4 d to 5.3 (1.
Similar to DFA isomers, the amount of lignin in microgravity-grown shoots was signiﬁcantly

lower than in 1 g—grown sheets on 5.3 (1, although the amounts were almost the same in sheets
from both conditions on 4 (1 (Table 3). These results suggest that, as with DFA, a microgravity
environment reduced lignin formation and that the reduced amount of lignin may contribute
to suppressing cell wall stiffening under microgravity. In contrast to our results, lignin content
was almost the same in wheat seedlings grown on the ground and in microgravity conditions
in space, when seedlings were cultivated under light irradiation [42]. This result suggests that
light irradiation may negate the effects of microgravity 0n the lignin formation.
Activity Of PAL and CW-PRX
The activity of PAL has been shown to be involved in regulating levels of wall-bound phenolic
acid monomers in some gramineous shoots [13—15]. Moreover, the treatment with an inhibitor
of PAL decreased the amount of wall-bound FA in maize cell suspensions [8]. In the present
study, PAL activity in rice shoots increased progressively from 4 d to 5.6 (1 (Table 4), as
observed in a previous study [20]. The PAL activities in microgravity-grown shoots were
almost comparable to those in artificial 1 g—grown shoots at both 4 d and 5.6 (1 (Table 4). These

results are consistent With the Changes in the amounts of phenolic acid monomers such as FA
and p-coumaric acid in shoots in both gravitational conditions (Fig 2).

The CW-PRX has been thought to catalyze the coupling reaction of FA to produce DFA

[10, 18]. CW-PRX might also be involved in lignin formation, particularly polymerization of
lignin [18, 43]. In our previous study, hypergravity treatment increased lignin content and
CW-PRX activity in stems of azuki bean seedlings [24]. CW-PRX activity may thus be a crucial
factor in the regulation of DFA and lignin formation under altered gravity conditions. In the
present study, CW-PRX activity was measured using two substrates, guaiacol and FA. As With
PAL (Table 4), the activity of CW-PRX increased substantially from 4 d to 5.6 d, irrespective of
substrates, but the increases in CW-PRX activity in microgravity-grown shoots were signiﬁ-
cantly smaller than those in 1 g—grown shoots (Fig 4). The amounts of DFA isomers (Fig 3) and
lignin (Table 3) changed in parallel With CW-PRX activity. These results suggest that suppres-
sion of the increase in CW-PRX activity may be involved in the reduction of DFA and lignin
formation under microgravity conditions. We have reported that both CW-PRX activity and
lignin content increased gradually from the upper, immature (growing) region toward the

basal, mature region of azuki bean stems and that there was a close correlation between the lig-
nin content and the enzyme actiVity [24]. Furthermore, the increase in CW-PRX actiVity was
associated with the cessation of growth of rice coleoptiles [20]. Since CW-PRX is responsible
for making firm cell wall architecture by promoting the formation of intra-network structures
such as ferulate networks and lignin, an important role of CW-PRX may be to lead the cell wall
development such as the transition from a ﬂexible, immature wall to the rigid, mature wall.
Expression of CW-PRX genes
Peroxidases in plant cells are divided into two major groups, class I and class III. Class I and III
are considered as intracellular peroxidases and secretory peroxidases, respectively [18, 31].
CW-PRX belongs to the class III peroxidases. Class III peroxidases usually form large multi-
genic families and the rice genome contains 138 class III peroxidase genes [31]. To investigate
the expression levels of CW-PRX, we analyzed class III peroxidase gene expression using
microarray analysis data. Of 138 candidate genes, signals of 117 genes were detected, but the
ﬂuorescence intensity values of many genes were negligible. Twenty-five genes had a high
value of ﬂuorescence intensity (more than 10,000) and the intensity values of these genes
changed during the growth period (SI Table). Therefore, we calculated the difference (increase
or decrease) in ﬂuorescence intensity between 4 d and 5.6 d (Fig 5). The intensity values of
most of the genes increased from 4 d to 5.6 d. In particularly, the values of genes no. 11, no. 65
and no. 125 increased greatly during this period and their values were lowered under micro-
gravity conditions. In the previous study, we analyzed the expression levels of rice class III per-
oxidase genes during shoot development by the quantitative real-time RT-PCR [20]. We have
designed a set of primers based on the conserved region of siX class III peroxidase genes. The
expression levels measured using such primers showed a good accordance with the CW-PRX
actiVity in rice shoots [20]. Using these primers, the expression level of peroxidase genes on 5.6
d was analyzed. The expression level in shoots grown under microgravity conditions (72i7.0%,
n = 4) was significantly lower than that grown under artiﬁcial 1 g conditions (100i5.1%, n = 4).
These results indicate that a microgravity environment lowered the expression levels of class
III peroxidase genes in rice shoots. In a recent report, it was shown that a microgravity enViron-
ment reduced the expression levels of some class III peroxidase genes in Arabidopsis seedlings
and the reduction of peroxidase gene expression was involved in reduced root hair growth
under microgravity conditions [44]. From these findings, we assume that a microgravity enVi-
ronment represses the expression of certain class III peroxidase genes in shoots of terrestrial
plants and that the modiﬁcation of gene expression levels may be involved in the modulation
of CW-PRX actiVity under microgravity conditions.

In contrast to microgravity, hypergraVity treatment has been shown to increase expression
levels of a class III peroxidase gene and genes related to the lignin biosynthesis in Arabidopsis
inﬂorescence stems [45]. Therefore, we also analyzed the expression levels of lignin-related
genes using data of the microarray analysis (82 Table). However, a microgravity environment
for several days had minimal effect on the expression levels of lignin-related genes in rice
shoots (82 Table).

Plants are constantly exposed to environmental stimuli such as gravity, light and water sta-
tus, and they continually respond to them. Various compounds in plant cells act as signaling
molecules that mediate responses to stimuli. Tamaoki et a1. [45] reported that hypergraVity
treatment stimulated endogenous auXin accumulation in Arabidopsis inﬂorescence stems, sug-
gesting that auXin dynamics may be involved in plant responses against altered gravitational
force. In addition, it has been shown that hydrogen peroxide, a requisite substance for peroxi-
dase reaction, functions as a signaling molecule in plants and it is involved in gravitropism

horizontal curvature of primary roots of grass pea seedlings [47]. Therefore, the hydrogen per-
oxide signaling may also be involved in responses against altered gravity conditions such as

microgravity and hypergraVity. In a recent report, it was shown that the level of hydrogen per-
oxide in callus cell cultures of Arabidopsis changed in transient microgravity phases during
parabolic ﬂights [48]. These ﬁndings suggest that long term microgravity environment might
alter the cellular hydrogen peroxide level by which the downstream signaling events including
gene expression would be modulated.
Conclusions
The results of the present study showed, for the first time, that a microgravity environment
could suppress the formation of ferulate networks in cell walls of rice shoots by modifying the
expression levels of certain class III peroxidase genes and thus the actiVity of CW-PRX. The
lowered actiVity of CW-PRX was also associated with a decrease in lignin formation. Reduced
formation of structures within the cell wall, Via the effects on the ferulate network and lignin,
may be involved in keeping the cell wall loose under microgravity conditions. Opposite
changes have been observed in plant shoots grown under hypergraVity conditions [22—24].
This suggests that the network structures mediated by hydroxycinnamates may serve a load-
bearing function and contribute to the rigidity of the cell wall against the force of gravity.
Taken together, the present results provide evidence that gravitational stimuli modify the
metabolism of cell wall hydroxycinnamates and thus regulate the mechanical strength of the
cell wall of gramineous plants.
