Abstract
Advanced technology and the desire to explore space have resulted in increasingly longer manned space missions. Long
Duration Space Flights (LDSF) have provided a considerable amount of scientiﬁc research on the ability of humans to
. adapt and function in microgravity environments. In addition, studies conducted in analogous environments. such as
winter—over expeditions in Antarctica, have complemented the scientific understanding of human performance in LDSF.
These ﬁndings indicate long duration missions may take a toll on the individual, both physiologically and psychologically,
with potential impacts on performance. Significant factors in any manned LDSF are habitability, workload and
performance. They are interrelated and influence one another, and therefore necessitate an integrated research
approach. An integral part of this approach will be identifying and developing tools not only for assessment of habitability,
workload, and performance, but also for prediction of these factors as well. In addition, these tools will be used to identify
and provide countermeasures to minimize decrements and maximize mission success. The purpose of this paper is to
identify research goals and methods for the international Space Station (ISS) in order to identify critical factors and level of
impact on habitability, workload, and performance, and to develop and validate countermeasures. Overall, this approach
will provide the groundwork for creating an optimal environment in which to live and work onboard lSS as well as
preparing for longer planetary missions.
