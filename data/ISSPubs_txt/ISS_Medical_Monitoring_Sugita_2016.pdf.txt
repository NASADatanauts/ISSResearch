Abstract (3
The International Space Station (ISS) is a huge manned construct located approximately E:
400 km above the earth and is inhabited by astronauts performing space experiments. g
Because the station is within a closed microgravity environment, the astronauts are a
subject to consistent stress. This study analyzed the temporal changes in the skin fungal E;

during, and after their stay in the ISS. Lipophilic skin fungi, Malassezia predominated E
most samples regardless of the collection period, body site (cheek or chest), or subject. g
During their stay in the ISS, the level of Malassezia colonization changed by 7.6- i 7.5-fold E'
(mean 1 standard deviation) and 9.5- i 24.2-fold in cheek and chest samples, respectively. E

At the speCIes level, M. restricta, M. globosa, and M. sympodlalls were more abundant. g
In the chest samples, the ratio of M. restricta to all Malassezia species increased, whereas ‘3)
it did not change considerably in cheek samples. Fungal diversity was reduced, and the ﬁ
ratio of Malassezia to all fungal colonization increased during the astronauts’ stay at E
the ISS. The ascomycetous yeast Cyberlindnera jadinii was detected in abundance in
the in-flight sample of 5 of the 10 astronauts. The microorganism may have incidentally
adhered to the skin during the preflight period and persisted on the skin thereafter. This
observation suggests the ability of a specific or uncommon microorganism to proliferate
in a closed environment. Our study is the first to reveal temporal changes in the skin
fungal microbiota of ISS astronauts. These findings will provide information useful for
maintaining the health of astronauts staying in the space environment for long periods
and for preventing infection due to the human skin microbiota.
Key words: astronauts, fungal microbiota, International Space Station, Malassezia, skin.

Figure 2. Temporal change in the level of Malassezia colonization in the astronauts' cheek and chest samples (A) Cheek samples, (B) chest samples,
and (C) mean i: standard deviation of the cheek and chest samples. The level of Malassezia colonization in cheek and chest samples from 10
astronauts was determined using a qPCR assay. Skin samples were collected prior to the astronauts’ visit to the ISS, twice during their stay at the
ISS, and after their return to Earth (preflight, in-flight1 and 2, and post-flight samples, respectively).
