In any two-phase mixture that contains particles of different sizes, the large particles
tend to grow while the smaller particles shrink in a process called coarsening. One illustra-
tion is tiny oil droplets embedded in water coalescing into larger droplets but the process
occurs in solids as well. Coarsening occurs on Earth during the processing of any metal
alloy thus affecting products from dental ﬁllings t0 turbine blades. Since the properties
of an alloy are linked to the size of the particles within the solid, coarsening can be used
to strengthen materials. This is the case with the majority of aluminum alloys used com-
mercially today. Conversely, if the coarsening process proceeds too long the material can
weaken. This occurs in jet turbine blades and is one of the reasons why they must be
replaced after a certain number of hours of service. Thus developing accurate models of
the coarsening process is central to creating a wide range of new materials from those used
in automobiles to those used in space applications. The results of previous experiments
performed on the International Space Station have done just that. These models have been
incorporated into a computer code that is being used to design many new materials, includ-
ing materials of importance to NASAs spaceﬂight program. Solid-liquid systems are ideal
to study this coarsening process. However, gravity can induce particle sedimentation and
thus hamper the studies of coarsening in these mixtures on Earth. Using the microgravity
environment of the International Space Station (188), it is possible to study the coarsening
process in solid-liquid mixtures with reduced interference from the sedimentation that oc-
curs on Earth. Speciﬁcally we will study the rate at which particles of tin suspended in a
liquid comprised of a molten tin-lead alloy coarsen. The results of our experiments, results
of the engineering tests of our furnaces aboard the International Space Station and future
plans for experiments will be discussed.

I. Introduction

Coarsening 0r Ostwald ripening occurs in a wide range of multi—phase materials. In an isothermal two—
phase system with a distribution of spherical particles of various radii, R, the system wants to minimize its
free energy and does so by reducing its interfacial area through a mass diffusion process. In an effort to
decrease the total interfacial area per volume, small particles disappear and large particles grow. This process
is driven by the dependence of the interfacial concentration on the mean curvature, H , 0f the interface. The
equilibrium concentration at the interface in the matrix of a small particle with large H is higher than that
of a large particle with low H , and thus mass ﬂows from the small particle to the large particle and the
small particle disappears. As a result the average particle size increases with time while the number density
of particles decreases, and the total volume fraction of particles remains constant. A particularly important
aspect of the coarsening process of a system of spherical particles is that the mean curvature of a particle
is given by H = l/R, meaning that the concentration along the interface of a spherical particle is constant.
Therefore only the particle radius is needed to deﬁne the interfacial boundaries and to specify the interfacial
concentration and curvatures. There is thus a direct link between the curvature of a particle and its volume.

The coarsening of a two—phase system with spherical particles has received extensive study, both theo—
reticallyk8 and experimentally?11 The kinetics of Ostwald ripening were studied theoretically by Lifshitz
and Slyozov1 and by Wagner2 and it was shown that the microstructure and speciﬁcally R will evolve with
time as follows:

R302) — 1323(0) : KLSWt (1)
where R(t) is the average particle radius (which serves as a measure of the system’s length scale) at a time
t, R(O) is the average particle radius in the beginning of coarsening and K LSW is the LSW coarsening rate
constant. For an isothermal solid—quuid system K LSW is given by:

STOFD

KLSW 9ML(CS _ CL) (2)
T 0 is the coarsening temperature, F is the capillary length of the matrix or liquid phase, D is the diffusion
coefﬁcient of the solute in the matrix, M L is the slope of the quuidus curve at T 0, and CS and CL are
the equilibrium concentrations of the solute at a planar interface in the solid and liquid, respectively. The
coarsening rate constant, K , is a function of volume fraction, Q5, such that:

KW) = KLSWf<¢> (3)
where f (Q5) is a system independent function, such that K : K LSW when Q5 2 0.

Another important Characteristic of the coarsening process for a system of spherical particles is self—
similarity, which is well established, both experimentally and theoretically. SeIf—similarity describes the fact
that the size distributions of spherical particles for different coarsening times become almost identical when
scaled 0r renormalized by a time dependent length scale, in this case the average radius R. The LSW theory
examines the coarsening of inﬁnitely separated, spherical particles, that is it assumes zero volume fraction.
In the limit where t —> 00, it was found that the microstructure should become seIf—similar when scaled by
the average particle size. This is also termed the steady—state coarsening.

The Coarsening in Solid—Liquid Mixtures (CSLM) experiment took place in the microgravity glovebox in
the Spacelab during space shuttle missions STS—83 and STS—94. The experiment was successful and it showed
that solid—quuid mixtures consisting of Sn particles in a Pb—Sn eutectic liquid, along with a microgravity
environment, are ideal systems to study the coarsening behavior of two—phase systems. The purpose of the
currently ongoing Coarsening in Solid—Liquid Mixtures 2 (CSLM—Z) experiment is to examine the coarsening
process at longer coarsening times and a wider range of volume fractions. Speciﬁcally the CSLM data was
insufﬁcient to accurately determine the way the microstructure and the ripening kinetics vary with volume
fraction. Also during CSLM it was found that transient coarsening was signiﬁcantly longer than expected
and the steady—state coarsening regime was never reached. Therefore CSLM—2 involves experiments that are
longer in time and more isothermal, increasing the possibility of being able to reach steady—state coarsening.

The solid—liquid system that was Chosen for this work is a mixture of Sn particles in a Pb—Sn eutectic
matrix. The lead—tin system offers many beneﬁts from an experimental point of View because of its low
eutectic temperature (18300), a Virtually isotropic interfacial energy and its documented availability of
physical and thermodynamic elata.9 It is also convenient because of the spherical particles formed and its
rapid coarsening rate (a large Change in particle radius occurs over a relatively short time). Naturally since
the CSLM—2 experiments are the next step from the CSLM experiments, the same system was Chosen for
continuity and comparison purposes. Solid—liquid systems have the disadvantage that the density difference
between the solid and the liquid phase leads to sedimentation 0f the particles during coarsening. In our
case, to avoid the sedimentation of Sn particles, as well as limit the amount of convection in the liquid, the
experiments were performed in microgravity.

The samples were cast and cold worked following the method used by Hardy and Voorhees.9 In micro—
gravity, the samples are ﬁrst heated to the solid—liquid regime, held isotherrnally at 18500 (200 above the
eutectic temperature for the Pb—Sn system) for the coarsening time Chosen and then quenched quickly. Once
all the experiments are complete the samples will be returned to Earth and retrieved from the Shuttle in
order to be analyzed in our laboratory.

The experiments being performed for the CSLM—2 project examine longer coarsening times and higher
volume fractions than the CSLM experiments. Table 1 shows the different sample processing units (SPUs)
for ﬁve different coarsening times and a total of twenty samples. These SPUs were sent to the 188 during
space shuttle mission STS—118 and will likely return to Earth on STS—122.

III. Discussion

When the CSLM coarsening experiments were performed aboard the 188 during the space shuttle missions
STS—83 and STS—94, it was believed that the evolution of a coarsening system to the steady—state regime was
rapid. Many experiments determined that they had reached steady state quickly based on the self—sirnilarity
0f the particle size distribution (PSD). However it was f0unel13’14 that there was an excellent agreement
between the experimentally measured coarsening rates and PSDs or spatial correlation functions and the
two theories for transient Ostwald ripening.8’ 12 A particularly surprising ﬁnding was that steady state was
never reached, even though the average particle radius of the system increased by a factor of three during
the experiment. The microstructures never reached the steady state regime for any of the volume fractions
and therefore were not self—similar.15 The kinetics of coarsening are also affected by the non—steady state
conditions. It was found that the measured coarsening rate constant was higher than what is predicted by
steady—state coarsening.

At the time of submission of this article the CSLM—2 project coarsening experiments were underway on the
ISS and the two longer coarsening time experiments had been completed. Preliminary data analysis suggests
that the experiments were successful, since the coarsening furnace operated as desired. The heat—up and
quench were in accord with previous experiments and equally importantly the furnace was held in isothermal
conditions throughout the duration of the experiment. This is quite important since the previous (CSLM)
experiments consisted of runs with shorter coarsening times and the 48 hr and 34 hr experiments represent
the ﬁrst time that such long times have been attempted. Figures 1 and 2 show the Change of temperature
over time during the start of coarsening and the quench for the 48 hr and the 34 hr run, respectively.
There are four resistance temperature detectors (RTDs) that monitor and record the temperature every
few seconds. The variations in temperature of the various RTDs is likely due to small differences in the

experiments during coarsening and the fast quench can be observed in these plots.

Once the coarsening experiments are complete and are returned to Earth, the samples Will then be
analyzed in both two and three dimensions, the latter not possible at the time of the CSLM experiments.
The analysis Will consist of the study of the particle morphology, the coarsening rate, the interfacial curvature,
the average length scale of the system, the crystallographic orientation of contacting particles and three—
dimensional reconstructions, as well as comparison With the theory and the CSLM results.

IV. Summary

Coarsening experiments using the Pb—Sn system in microgravity conditions at the ISS allow us to gain a
better insight in the theory of Ostwald ripening. Previous experiments (CSLM) were successful and provided
a wealth of unique data on the coarsening process. Further experiments (CSLM—2) were deemed necessary
in View of the surprising results obtained by CSLM. These experiments are currently ongoing and involve
more isothermal conditions, longer coarsening times and higher volume fractions. TWO—dimensional and
three—dimensional analysis of these samples Will follow When the CSLM—2 experiment returns to Earth.
