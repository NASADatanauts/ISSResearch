NASBA monitoring of the microbiological quality of recycled water onboard 155. Both concentration and recovery
RT'PCR of microorganisms are the main critical steps when the microﬁltration technology is used for water
analysis. Among ﬁlters recommended standards for monitoring the microbiological quality of the water,
the polycarbonate ﬁlter was fully in line with the requirements of the ISO 7704—1985 standard in terms
of eﬁicacy of capture and recovery of bacteria. Moreover, this ﬁlter does not retain nucleic acids on
the surface and has no inhibitory effect on their downstream processing steps such as puriﬁcation and
ampliﬁcation/detection. Although the Midass system was designed for the treatment of air samples, the
ﬁrst results on the integration of PC ﬁlters were encouraging. Nevertheless, system modiﬁcations are
needed to better adapt the Midass system for the monitoring of the microbiological water quality.
