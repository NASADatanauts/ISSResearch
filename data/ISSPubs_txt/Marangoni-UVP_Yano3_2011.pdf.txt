Abstract. Microgravity experiments on the thermocapillary convection in liquid bridge, called

Marangoni Experiment in Space (MEIS), are carried out in “KIBO” of 188. Three series of

experiments, MEIS-l, 2, and 4, have been conducted so far. This paper reports the results

obtained from MEIS-4, in Which ZOCSt silicone oil (Pr=207) is used to generate large liquid

bridges. They are suspended between coaxial disks that are 50mm in diameter, With their

maximum length equal to 62.5mm. MEIS-4 aims at (1) determining the critical temperature

difference for the onset of oscillatory ﬂow; (2) realizing high Marangoni number conditions for

high Pr ﬂuid; (3) clarifying the effects of volume ratio, heating rate, hysteresis, and cooled disk

temperature; and (4) observing Whether the hydrothermal wave With azimuthal mode number

m=0 appears or not. The main results are presented and compared With those obtained in

MEIS-l and 2, Which utilized liquid bridges of ScSt silicone oil (Pr=67).
1. Introduction
Thermocapillary convection is the ﬂow that is driven by the surface tension-gradient along a liquid-
gas interface. In general, the surface tension, 0, negatively depends on the temperature of the working
ﬂuid. Along the liquid-gas interface With a non-uniform temperature ﬁeld, the surface tension
difference drives the ﬂow from the higher temperature region toward the lower temperature region.
The resultant convection is called thermocapillary convection 0r Marangoni convection.
Thermocapillary convection becomes important in liquid ﬁlms, droplets, bubbles, and liquid bridges.

The liquid bridge (LB) is the geometry that is originally seen in the ﬂoating-zone method for

crystal growth, as illustrated in F ig. 1a. This method is for manufacturing high-quality single crystals
of high purity. The feed material is heated by a ring heater and the melt is suspended between the feed
rod at one end and the already grown crystal at the other end. The temperature difference between the
melting region and the solidiﬁed region is the driving force for the thermocapillary convection. This
ﬂow conﬁguration is modeled to a LB suspended between two coaxial disks With different

temperatures, as illustrated in Fig. 1b. This simpliﬁed geometry is called a half—zone model. The
temperature difference between the disks, AT, drives a ﬂow that is directed from the heated disk
toward the cooled disk, along the surface, and returns inside the LB. This geometry is now recognized
as one of the basic ﬂow ﬁelds for the study of thermocapillary convection, along with its instability
mechanisms.

It is known that the thermocapillary convection in a LB changes from a steady, aXisymmetric state
to an oscillatory, non-aXisymmetric one, if AT exceeds a certain level. The appearance of such a ﬂow
causes the deterioration of the quality in the grown crystal. This instability is related to many factors,
such as, the aspect ratio of the LB, the physical properties of the working ﬂuid, the ambient gas
condition, and so on. Therefore, a large number of studies have been conducted for the instability
mechanisms in half—zone LBs.

A series of microgravity experiments, called Marangoni Experiment in Space (MEIS), have been
conducted as the ﬁrst science experiment on the Japanese Experimental Module “KIBO” 0f the
International Space Station (188). Three series of experiments, MEIS-l, MEIS-2, and MEIS-4 were
carried out in 2008, 2009, and 2010, respectively. The overview of MEIS-l and 2 was reported by
Kawamura et a1. [1] in 2010. The present paper reports the main results of MEIS-4. This experiment
was conducted in the period from October 26 to December 22, 2010. Its purpose is to collect data on
the following phenomena, in large LBs (50mm in diameter and up to 62.5mm in length), which can
form only in a long-period microgravity environment on 188:

(1) to determine the critical temperature difference for the onset of oscillatory ﬂow,
(2) to realize high Marangoni number conditions for high Pr ﬂuid,
(3) to clarify the effects of volume ratio, heating rate, hysteresis, and cooled disk temperature, and
(4) to observe if the hydrothermal wave with the azimuthal mode number m=0 appears.

All the experiments were performed in the Fluid Physics Experiment Facility (FPEF), which was
especially designed for the present microgravity experiment. It was remote-controlled by the operation
staffs and the science team members from Tsukuba Space Center (TKSC) 0f JAXA in Japan. Each
experimental run started from 6:00 o’clock and ended at 15:00 o’clock in Japanese Standard Time
(J ST). This period is corresponding to 21 :00 and 6:00 in Greenwich Mean Time (GMT), during which
the astronauts are expected to sleep. Therefore, the g-jitters that might be caused by the astronaut
actiVities can be minimized during experiment.

As shown in Fig. 2, several measurement apparatuses are installed in FPEF. They are (1) three top-

observing the shape of the LB and the overall ﬂow pattern, (3) an IR camera for measuring surface
temperature and observing hydrothermal waves, and (4) thermocouple sensors for measuring
temperature distribution and detecting the onset of oscillation. Three ﬂnger-sized B/W CCD cameras
are mounted near the heated disk. Their image is 768 x494 pixel at a frame rate of 30fps. The heated
disk is made of sapphire so that the top-View cameras can observe the ﬂow in the LB. An IR camera
having a wavelength sensitivity of 8-14um is used to Visualize surface temperature from the same
Viewing direction as the side-VieW camera. A traversable thermocouple sensor is adopted in MEIS-4. It
is to detect the onset of oscillation and can be traversed in aXial and radial directions.

2.2. Experimental conditions

A LB of silicone oil is formed between two coaXial disks heated differently. The chamber is ﬁlled With
argon gas at 94kPa and about 21°C. The geometry of the LB is illustrated in Fig. 1b. The cooled disk
is made of aluminum. The disk diameter is 50mm in MEIS-4 and 30mm in MEIS-l and 2. Each disk
has 45 -degree edge to prevent liquid leakage. The cooled disk is traversed in the aXial direction so that
a Wide range of aspect ratio, Ar (EH/D), Where H and D are the LB length and the disk diameter,
respectively, can be realized. The values of the maximum LB length, With the 50mm and 30mm disks,
are respectively 62.5mm and 60mm, for Which Ar=1.25 and 2.0, respectively. Note that the maximum
length of the LB in the 1g environment is about 3mm, and the longer LB can be generated only in a
microgravity environment.

Figure 3 shows one such LB With Ar=1.25; it is generated in MEIS-4. The volume ratio, Vr (2 V/ V0),
deﬁnes the ratio of the LB volume, V, to the gap volume between the disks, V0 (ED2H/4). The Vr=1.0
condition gives a straight cylindrical shape. The volume ratio is basically ﬁxed at 0.95 to stabilize the
LB; and, thus, to prevent ﬂuid leakage from the edge of the disks. In some experiments, the volume
ratio was changed in the range from 0.91 to 1.05 to study the effect of Vr on the onset of the oscillation.

Silicone oil with the kinematic Viscosity of ZOCSt is used as the working ﬂuid in MEIS-4, While
silicone oil With the kinematic Viscosity of 5cSt is used in MEIS-l and 2. The Prandtl number, Pr, of
the former liquid is 207, While that of the latter one is 67, at 25°C (Shin-Etsu Chemical Co., LTD, KF-
96L). The effect of Pr is, thus, examined. One of the important purposes in MEIS-4 is to observe
Whether hydrothermal waves With m=0 appear or not. This is motivated by the linear stability analysis
of Xu and DaVis [2], Who analyzed thermocapillary instabilities in an inﬁnitely long LB. They
reported that the azimuthal mode number of the hydrothermal waves depends on Pr of the working
ﬂuid and that m=0 appears When Pr exceeds the value of 62.2. More recently, however, Ryzhkov [3]
carried out a linear stability analysis Which is similar to that reported by Xu and DaVis [2] but he
reported that the critical mode With m=0 for Pr higher than 62.2 is not conﬁrmed in his analysis. The
Pr in MEIS-4 is 207, Which is high enough to check if the critical mode With m=0 appears for long
liquid bridges.

The physical properties of each of the silicone oil are given in Table l. The working ﬂuid is seeded
with the tracer particles for the ﬂow Visualization. These particles are gold-nickel-coated polymer
particles, and their average diameter and density are l80um and l300kg/m3, respectively. The density
ratio between the tracer particle and the silicone oil is close to unity, and the ﬁdelity of the particle to
the ﬂuid motion is checked numerically.

The critical temperature difference, ATC, required for the onset of the oscillation of the ﬂow and
temperature ﬁelds, is determined by a stepwise adjustment of AT (ETh—Tc ). The cooled disk
temperature, T C, is kept constant at 20°C, except for a few cases where T C is varied to especially
examine its effect. On the other hand, the T h is always changed in a stepwise manner. The lower and
higher temperature limits of the cooled and the heated disks, respectively, are 10°C and 85°C. The
maximum temperature difference is about 75°C. A sufﬁciently long waiting time (more than 60min) is
given after each of the stepwise temperature changes, AT. The onset of the oscillation is detected by
the traversable thermocouple sensor and the motion of tracer particles in the LB.

3. Result and discussion

3.1. Instability 0fthermocapillary convection

In MEIS-4, ATC was measured for Ar=0.225~l .25. F igure 4 shows the measured ATC plot as a function
of Ar. From here, it is eVident that the ATC decreases with Ar, showing local peaks at Ar=0.87. The
results of MEIS-l and 2 are in good agreement with each other, while the results of MEIS-4 show
appreciably larger values. These results are perhaps caused by the differences in Pr and in the size of
the LB (3 0mm vs. 50mm in diameter).

For better understanding, the ATC is non-dimensionalized as the critical Marangoni number, Mac, as
follows:

|aTlATH
Ma 2 f (1)
pva

where ,0, V, a, and GT are the density, kinematic Viscosity, thermal diffusivity and temperature
coefﬁcient of surface tension, respectively. The values of ,0, a, and GT for the 2OCSt and 5cSt silicone
oils are given in Table l where 17 is the mean of V(Th) and V(TC), and dependent on the disk
temperature. The Ma represents the strength of thermocapillary convection, by which the onset of
oscillatory ﬂow can be speciﬁed. In microgravity, other dimensionless parameters (such as, Grashof
number and Bond number), which could have potentially affected the onset of the oscillation, become
zero. This is advantageous for the study of the instability mechanisms of thermocapillary convection.
The obtained Mac is plotted as a function of Ar, in F ig. 5. The results from MEIS-l and 2 can be seen
to be in good agreement with each-other. Moreover, the results from MEIS-2 and 4 show a local peak
at Ar=0. 87.

F igure 6 shows the oscillation frequency, f, plotted as a function of Ar. It shows that f decreases
with Ar, for MEIS-l, 2, and 4. An interesting behaVior observed in MEIS-4 is the presence of the
fundamental (or 1st) frequency and its 2nd harmonics, for Ar>0.63. This behaVior is observed at a
temperature difference that is only slightly higher than ATC. Note the stepwise increase of AT in the
determination of ATC. Interestingly, the 2nd harmonics disappears when the AT is increased further
slightly. The appearance of the 2nd harmonics at nearly ATC was not observed in MEIS-l or 2. In F ig.
7, the dimensionless oscillation frequency, 7, is plotted as a function of Ar. This non-
dimensionalization was proposed by Preisser et al. [4], as follows:

It is seen that the dimensionless fundamental frequency from MEIS-4 is in agreement With the
dimensionless oscillation frequencies from MEIS-l and 2, for Ar=0.67~1.25. This may indicate that
the non-dimensionalization of Eq. (2) is appropriate for the LES of different, high Pr ﬂuids. The data
from MEIS-2 eXhibit a jump of f at Ar=1.25~1.50, suggesting that the oscillation mode changes from
azimuthal mode into aXial mode (Schwabe [5], Yano et a1. [6]). This behaviour is not conﬁrmed in
MEIS-4 due to the Ar31.25 condition.

The modes of oscillation observed in MEIS-4 are given in Table 2, together with the value of? and T
(2f '1). The azimuthal mode, m, was determined from the motion of the tracer particles, and the
oscillation with m=0 was not observed in the present experiment. This observation is in agreement
with the result reported by Ryzhkov [3] who found a new branch of neutral mode with m=l for high
Pr ﬂuids (say P121995) for thermally insulated boundary conditions. Although not shown in this
paper, the IR images acquired for Ar=l.00 and 1.25 indicate that the hydrothermal waves propagate
along the LB surface in the direction from the heated disk towards the cooled disk (cf. Yano et al. [6]).
This propagation direction is in opposite to that reported by Ryzhkov. The reason for this discrepancy
is not clear yet and, as conjectured by Ryzhkov, the direct comparison between experiment for LB
with ﬁnite length and linear stability analysis for LB with inﬁnite length may not be possible. From
the data obtained in MEIS-l and 2, Yano et al. [6] pointed out several fundamental differences in the
characteristics of oscillatory ﬂow and temperature ﬁelds between an inﬁnitely long LB (considered by
Xu and Davis [2]) and the ﬁnitely long LBs that are experimented in MEIS. This issue will be studied
in MEIS-3, which is to be conducted soon by using a 20cSt silicone oil LB with Ar=2.0.
3.2. High Marangoni number conditions
Several experiments for high Ma conditions were also carried out in MEIS-4, by exploiting the
hardware capability, which allowed us to increase T h up to as high as 85°C. As a result, AT=64.8°C
and 619°C was achieved for Ar=l.0 and 1.25, respectively. These conditions correspond to
Ma/Mac=7.l and 8.3, respectively. Note that such high Ma conditions, relative to Mac, for high Pr
ﬂuids, are extremely difﬁcult in the ground experiments where ATC becomes high for short liquid
bridges. Figure 8 presents the IR images of the surface temperature ﬂuctuations at Ma/Mac =2.l, 5.2,
and 8.3, for Ar=l.25. The mean brightness levels are subtracted to enhance the brightness levels
corresponding to the surface temperature ﬂuctuations. In these ﬁgures, higher and lower temperature
regions appeared as the white and black regions, respectively. It can be observed that the lower
temperature regions propagate along the aXial direction, from the heated disk towards the cooled disk.
Yano et al. [6] reported that such a propagation of the temperature ﬁeld is associated with the
propagation of the velocity ﬁeld; and, therefore, this propagation is a hydrothermal wave. Initially the
oscillation mode of the hydrothermal wave is a standing wave (see Fig. 8a), which latter changes into
a rotating wave (see Fig. 8b). At Ma/Mac :83, in Fig. 8c, the propagation starts to eXhibit chaotic
features, consisting of ﬁne and ﬂuctuating structures in the surface temperature distributions.

4. Conclusions
This paper reports the basic characteristics of the instability of thermocapillary convection observed in
large liquid bridges that are formed in long microgravity environment on the 188. The working ﬂuid is
20cSt silicone oil, whose Prandtl number (Pr=207) is nearly three times higher than that of the 5cSt
silicone oil (Pr=67), which was used in our previous space experiments. The effect of the Prandtl
number is taken into account in the comparison of these space experiments.

The critical temperature difference, ATC, and the resultant Mac, Which is required for the onset of
oscillatory ﬂow, are determined in a Wide range of Ar (Ar=0.225~1.25). As expected, the measured
ATC for the Pr=207 is substantially higher than that for the Pr=67, for all the Ar cases. However, the
plots of Mac obtained for these Prandtl numbers, agree well With each other, With both showing a local
Mac peak at Ar=0.87. The oscillation frequency is also determined for the same Ar range. Non-
dimensional oscillation frequencies for Pr=207 and 67 agree well With each other, but those for
Pr=207 reveal the presence of a fundamental (or 1st) frequency and its 2nd harmonics for Ar>0.67.
The mode of oscillation for each Ar is obtained. The hydrothermal wave With m=0 is not observed
in the present experiment. This may indicate that the linear stability analysis, assuming an inﬁnitely
long liquid bridge, does not provide direct comparison With the experiments, Whose liquid bridges
have inevitably a ﬁnite length. The IR camera reveals that the surface temperature ﬂuctuations
propagate in the aXial direction, from the heated disk towards the cooled disk. The oscillation mode of
hydrothermal wave for, Ar=1.25, is standing wave, While it changes into a rotating wave, or chaotic
state, With increasing Ma.
