Abstract
New experimental studies of dusty plasma under microgravity conditions performed onboard
the International Space Station (188) are described. The experiments are made with the help of
the unique PK—3 Plus laboratory. The phase transition from an isotropic plasma state to a
string plasma state (called as the electrorheological plasma) has been demonstrated. Lane
formation was observed when studying interpenetration of two Clouds of different grain sizes.
The crystallization—melting experiment in the large 3D dusty plasma system was performed.
