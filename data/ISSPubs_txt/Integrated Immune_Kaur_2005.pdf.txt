Abstract
As part of the systematic evaluation of the innate immune system for long duration missions, this study focused on the antimi-
crobial functions of monocytes in astronauts participating in spaceﬂight. The study included four space shuttle missions and 25
astronauts. Nine non-astronauts served as controls. Blood specimens were collected 10 days before launch, within 3 h after landing,
and again 3 days after landing. The number of monocytes did not differ signiﬁcantly over the interval sampled in both the astronaut
or control groups. However, following 5—11 days of spaceﬂight, the astronauts’ monocytes exhibited reductions in ability to engulf
Escherichia coli, elicit an oxidative burst, and degranulate. The phagocytic index was signiﬁcantly reduced following spaceﬂight
when compared to control values. This reduction in phagocytosis was accompanied by changes in the expression of two surface
markers involved in phagocytosis, CD32 and CD64. Levels of cortisol, epinephrine, and norepinephrine after spaceﬂight did not
increase over preﬂight values.
