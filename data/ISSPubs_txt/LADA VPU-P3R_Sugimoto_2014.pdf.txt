Abstract
Background
Spaceﬂight environment have been shown to generate reactive oxygen species (ROS) and
induce oxidative stress in plants, but little is known about the gene expression of the ROS
gene network in plants grown in long-term spaceﬂight. The molecular response and
adaptation to the spaceﬂight environment of Mizuna plants harvested after 27 days of
cultivation onboard the International Space Station (188) were measured using genome-wide
mRNA expression analysis (mRNA-Seq).
Results
Total reads of transcripts from the Mizuna grown in the 188 as well as 011 the ground by
mRNA-Seq showed 8,258 and 14,170 transcripts up—regulated and down-regulated,
respectively, in the space-grown Mizuna when compared with those from the ground-grown
Mizuna. A total of 20 in 32 ROS oxidative marker genes were up—regulated, including high
expression of four hallmarks, and preferentially expressed genes associated with ROS-
seavenging including thioredoxin, glutaredoxin, and alternative oxidase genes. In the
transcription factors of the ROS gene network, MEKKl-MKK4-MPK3, OXIl-MKK4-
MPK3, and OXIl-MPK3 of MAP cascades, induction of WRKY22 by MEKKl-MKK4-
MPK3 cascade, induction of WRKY25 and repression of Zat7 by Zat12 were suggested.
RbohD and Rbth genes were up—regulated preferentially in NADPH oxidase genes, which
produce ROS.
Conclusions
This large-seale transeriptome analysis revealed that the spaceﬂight environment induced
oxidative stress and the ROS gene network activation in the space-grown Mizuna. Among
transcripts altered in expression by space conditions, some were common genes response to
abiotie and biotic stress. Furthermore, certain genes were exclusively up—regulated in Mizuna
grown on the ISS. Surprisingly, Mizuna grew in space normally, as well as 011 the ground,

Background

Plant cultivation in space will be necessary to augment stored foods when space mission
distances and durations increase, such as for long term bases on the Moon and Mars, and
even being considered for orbiting bases such as the International Space Station (188). Plants
can play an important role in supplying nutrients, oxygen, and water to humans and can be
eo-utilized for waste recycling in space [1,2], therefore, establishment of the culture
approaches and breeding/developing plants to optimize their performance in space will be
critical to future advanced space life support systems. In space, plants can be exposed to
unusual and extreme environments, such as space radiation, reduced gravity, reduced
atmospheric pressure, elevated 0r super-elevated CO2 concentrations, and temperature
excursions. In orbital, spaceﬂight cabin, lunar and Martian bases, environmental conditions
for plant cultivation such as temperature, light, air, and water could be controlled, however, it
would be hard to eliminate space radiation and reduced gravity, which are suspected to
perturb plant growth and development.

Space radiation and microgravity are suggested to generate reactive oxygen species (ROS) in
plants. Ionizing radiation produced ROS [3] and increased lipid peroxidation products in
erythrocytes of mice housed for about 100 days in 188 [4], and exposure of Arabidopsis
seedlings and callus cells to altered gravitational forces (clinorotation 0r hyper gravity) up-
regulated genes associated with cellular signaling, protein
phosphorylation/dephosphorylation, defense, stress response, and gravisensing [5-7]. Gene
expression proﬁles have been analyzed to understand the stress level and adaptation
challenges in plants grown in space. Arabidopsis plants (7 days old) launched and grown for
5 days in the Space Shuttle showed that the genes of HSP, drought-inducible calcium binding
protein, a MADS-box protein, and MAP kinases were induced 4-fold, compared with those of
ground control [8]. Pathogen response, wounding, drought, and cold associated genes, a gene
associated with auxin-mediated lateral root development, and an essential regulator gene of
photorespiration were up-regulated more than ﬁve-fold in the Arabidopsis seedlings, which
were germinated and grown for 12 days in the Space Shuttle. In addition, genes associated
heat shock, salt, drought, metals, wounding, phosphate, ethylene, senescence, terpenoids,
seed development, cell walls, photosynthesis, and auxin were up—regulated by more than ﬁve-
fold in the culture cells grown for 12 days in the Space Shuttle [9]. These results indicate that
plant genes in the ROS network, which are induced by abiotic and biotic stress [10,11], can
be triggered by changes related to the spaceﬂight environment. However, because of the
limitation of launching and cultivation in space, few studies on gene expression proﬁles have
been performed, and in many cases plant materials were transported to orbit (i.e., not grown
entirely in spaceﬂight), subj ecting them to transient responses that may not have been due to
spaceﬂight environment.

"
"5","We have developed a plant growth system, namely Lada, which was installed in 188 to study
and grow plants, including vegetables in a spaceﬂight environment. We have succeeded in
cultivating Mizuna, tomato, pea, radish, wheat, rice, and barley in Lada aboard 188. Both M1
and M2 pea grown from seeds formed during spaceﬂight showed no signiﬁcant difference in
growth, developmental characteristics, frequency of chromosome aberrations in primary root
meristem, and level of molecular polymorphism between offspring of space-grown and
ground control seeds [12]. On the other hand, transcription levels of superoxide dismutase,
glutamyl transferase, catalase, and ascorbate peroxidase were increased in the barley
germinated and grown for 26 days in Lada, though the whole-plant growth and development
of the barley in spaceﬂight were the same as in the ground control barley [13]. These results
suggest that plants can adapt to spaceﬂight environment by changing their ROS gene
network.

In this study, we investigated the response of the ROS gene network in Mizuna, Brassica
rapa var. nipposinica, cultivated for 27 days in 188. Mizuna is one of the model plants for
cultivating in Lada aboard 188 because it is a leafy vegetable that can fully develop in 4
weeks in order to supply not only a plant material for investigating the effect of spaceﬂight
environment but also a fresh vegetable for astronauts to take nutrient and beneﬁt mental
health quickly [14]. The ROS gene network consists of a vast numbers genes, therefore,
large-scale transcriptome analysis is necessary to clarify the stress level and adaptation
challenges in plants under the spaceﬂight environment. The mRNA-Seq strategy using next
generation sequencing (NGS) technology has become a powerful tool for analyzing genome-
wide gene expression and global transcriptional networks. mRNA-Seq overcomes the
limitations of microarray analysis, of which the probes are designed on the basis of a
reference genome sequence of model species and cover only small portion of a gene. We
demonstrated that an overall gene expression of the ROS gene network in the space-grown
Mizuna was characterized by mapping reads from the NGS analysis to the Brassica database
as a reference genome sequence and annotating genes. Our results provide a survey of plant
response to the spaceﬂight environment and deﬁne common and different genes and cascades
in the ROS gene network for adapting to the spaceﬂight environment.

Results and discussion

Growth of Mizuna in space

The seeds of Mizuna was transported to 18$, germinated, and grown in “Lada”, plant growth
chamber aboard the Russian segment of 188, which has successfully produced a harvest of
fresh vegetables and seeds in space [12,14,15]. The fresh weight and water content of the
space-grown Mizuna were 82.9 g and 92.5%, and those of the ground-grown Mizuna were
58.0 g and 92.0%, respectively, after 28 days of cultivation, showing that Mizuna grew as
well or better under spaceﬂight environment in 188 as well as on the ground. The reduced
growth of the ground controls was likely due to the close matching of watering protocols for
space and ground plants, which resulted in slower germination on the ground and some
wilting symptoms of some ground control plants just prior to harvest. Although similar
amounts of water were being added to space and ground plants, the tendency of water to
settle to the bottom of the root trays on the ground (and be more uniformly distributed in
space) could have affected overall growth.

"
"6","Construction of the Mizuna transcript dataset and identiﬁcation of
differentially expressed transcripts

Total reads of transcripts from the space-grcwn and the ground-grcwn Mizuna by paired-end
sequencing assay were 73,028,136 and 74,578,954. Also, 44,994,328 (61.6%) and
49,195,408 (66.0%) of transcripts of total reads were mapped to the reference Brassica rapa
genome sequence, respectively. A G-test [false discovery rate (FDR) < 0.001] was performed
on the read count of transcripts to detect differences in gene expression between the space-
grcwn and the ground-grcwn Mizuna, and to identify responsive transcripts of the space-
grcwn Mizuna. The numbers of up—regulated and down-regulated transcripts were 8,258 and
14,170, which respectively included 467 and 1,208 unannctated transcripts (Additional ﬁle 1:
Table 81).

These responsive genes were functionally characterized using Gene Ontology (GO)
enrichment analysis. A total of 1,707 and 2,895 probe sets of up—regulated and down-
regulated genes were respectively assigned to 26 and 52 terms in biological process category.
The greatest increase in up—regulated genes occurred in oxidation-reducticn process
(GO:0055114), followed by protein phosphorylation (GO:0006468), the total of which
represented 48% of biological process, whereas that of down-regulated genes was protein
phosphorylation (GO:0006468), which represents 38% (Figure 1, Additional ﬁle 2: Table
S2). Cytochrome P45 0 and protein kinase were the main genes in oxidation-reducticn process
and protein phosphorylation, respectively. Cytochrome P450 is associated with the
detoxiﬁcation reactions of xenobictic compounds activated to electrophilic molecules to
maintain the redox homeostasis [16]. Protein kinases play key roles in signal transduction
under abictic and biotic stress. These results suggest that redOX-oxidation state was perturbed
and that signal transduction is regulated in the cells of the space-grcwn Mizuna.

Figure 1 Distribution of up-regulated and down-regulated genes in biological process
category of Gene Ontology. A total of 1,707 and 2,895 probe sets of up—regulated and down-
regulated genes respectively in the space grown Mizuna were assigned to the biological
category. The number of top 20 GO terms in up—regulated genes and down-regulated genes
are shown. The x-aXis and y-aXis indicate the number of transcripts and the category,
respectively.

Expression proﬁles of oxidative marker and ROS—scavenging genes

Table 1 shows 32 ROS oxidative marker genes up-regulated more than ﬁve-fcld by hydrogen
peroxide, superoxide, 0r singlet oxygen in Arabidopsis, including putative trypsin inhibitor
(At2g43510), unknown protein (At1g19020), unknown protein (At1g05340), transmembrane
receptor (At1g57630), and unknown protein (At2g21640), which are regarded as hallmarks
for the general oxidative stress response [17]. In the space-grcwn Mizuna, 20 0f 32 genes
were up-regulated more than ﬁve-fcld. Especially, 4 0f 5 hallmark genes, Bra04768
(At2g43510, putative trypsin inhibitor), Bra031061 and Bra025707 (At1g19020, unknown
protein), Bra015419 (At1g05340, unknown protein), Bra031207 (At2g21640, unknown
protein), showed a greater than ten-fcld increase in expression. These results show that the
spaceﬂight environment induces oxidative stress in the cells of space-grcwn Mizuna.

"8","ROS-scavenging genes are induced to defend the cells from oxidative stress. The expression
level of transcripts associated with Arabidopsis ROS-scavenging genes [18] was conﬁrmed in
the space-grown Mizuna (Additional ﬁle 3: Table S3). In fact, 20 transcripts were up-
regulated more than two—fold, including the major ROS-scavenging enzymes: superoxide
dismutase, catalase, and glutathione peroxidase. A dramatic induction occurred in thioredoxin
(Bra014037) and glutaredoxin (Bra030102, Bra032911) genes, of which the levels were
increased more than 40-fold. Thioredoxin and glutaredoxin belong to the thioredOXin
superfamily known to be crucial for maintaining a reduced intracellular redox state and
oxidative defense [19]. Alternative oxidase (AOX) (Bra010153) was another highly
expressed gene, with 92-fold up—regulation. AOX activity increases in plants under oxidative
stress such as drought and salinity, and AOX functions as an antioxidant enzyme, acting to
alleviate ROS accumulation [20-22]. These results suggest that the Mizuna modulates ROS-
scavenging genes to eliminate oxidative stress induced by the spaceﬂight environment.
Expression proﬁles of ROS—responsive transcription factor genes

Plants sense the ROS level and change the expression of genes comprising the ROS signal
network that regulate growth, development, and stress defense. The ROS signals are induced
Via mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) cascades, which play a crucial role in abiotic
and biotic stress responses in plants (Figure 2). In Arabidopsis, MEKKI, 0X11, and ANPl
have been shown to function upstream to MAPK cascades. The MEKKI-MKKI/MKK2-
MPK4 cascade was shown to a key regulator of ROS stress signaling [23] and an MEKKI-
MKK2-MPK4/MPK6 cascade was identiﬁed in cold and salt stress [24,25]. An MEKKI-
MKK4/MKK5-MPK3/MPK6 cascade was shown to function in protoplasts treated with
bacterial ﬂagellin peptide [26] and MKK4 regulated MPK3 under salt stress [27]. An ANPI-
MKK4/MKK5-MPK3/MPK6 cascade was shown in H202 treated Arabidopsis plants [28].
An OXIl-MPK3/MPK6 cascade was activated by ROS [29] and an OXIl-NDPK2-
MPK3/MPK6 was suggested to enhance tolerance against freezing and salinity [30]. Aside
from the induction of MEKKI, ANPI, and 0X11 by H202, 0X11 is activated by PDKl Via
the PLC/D-PA pathway. The expression levels of the genes in the spaee-grown Mizuna
associated with Arabidopsis MAPK cascades are presented in Figure 2. MEKKl
(Bra037860), 0X11 (Bra015120), MKK4 (Bra030430), and MPK3 (Bra038281) were up-
regulated more than ﬁve-fold, indicating that MEKKl-MKK4-MPK3, OXIl-MKK4-MPK3,
and OXIl-MPK3 cascades were strongly activated Via ROS under spaceﬂight environment.
The expression of PDKI gene (Bra009447) by 1.0-f01d shows that PLC/D-PA-PDKI
pathway is not related to the up—regulation of 0X11 gene.

Figure 2 Expression levels of genes in the space—grown Mizuna associated with MAPK
cascade and transcription factor genes in ROS gene network. Pathway of MAPK cascade
and transcription factor genes in Arabidopsis known to activate under abiotic and biotic stress
are shown. Genes and fold change values in the spaee-grown Mizuna associated with MAPK
cascade and transcription factor genes in Arabidopsis are indicated in the boxes. The more
than ﬁve-fold up—regulated genes are highlighted by yellow and predicted active MAPK
cascades in the space-grown Mizuna are shown by red arrows.

Transcription factor genes WRKY and Zat respond to oxidative stress to control the
expression of ROS network genes, of which 11 WRKY and 3 Zat genes respond with more
than ﬁve-fold expression by oxidative stress in Arabidopsis [17]. In the spaee-grown Mizuna,
7 WRKY and 2 Zat genes were shown to have more than ﬁve-fold expression (Table 2).
Reportedly MEKKl-MEE4/MKK5-MPK3/MPK6 cascade activates WRKY22 and WRKY29

"
"9","in the ﬂagellin-treated Arabidopsis [26]. The expression levels of WRKY22 (Bra37368) and
WRKY29 (Bra019297) in spaee-grown Mizuna were 9.1 and 0.7-f01d, respectively,
suggesting the activation of MEKKl-MKK4-MPK3-WRKY22 cascade. It was indicated to
the negative control of WRKY25, WRKY33, and Zat12 by MEKK1-MKK1/MKK2-MPK4
cascade [23], however, WRKY25 (Bra022786), WRKY33 (Bra005104, Bra017117,
Bra000064), and Zat12 (Bra002528, Bra020284, Bra006691) genes were up—regulated in the
space-grown Mizuna, suggesting that the MEKKI-MKKl-MPK4 cascade in the spaee-grown
Mizuna regulates other transcription factors or ROS network genes. Zat12 is the inducer of
WRKY25 and Zat12 overexpression plants suppressed Zat7, which up—regulate WRKY70
[31,32]. Up—regulation 0f Zat12 and WRKY25 genes and lack of expression or down-
regulation of Zat7 and WRKY70 genes in the spaee-grown Mizuna suggest that Zat12 is a
regulator in the ROS signal transduction pathway involved in the spaceﬂight environment as
well as abiotic and biotic stress.

"10","To conﬁrm the predicted active MAPK cascade and transcription factor genes in the space-
grown Mizuna by mRNA-Seq, gene expression was analyzed by quantitative RT-PCR using
gene-speeiﬁc primers (Additional ﬁle 4: Figure 81, Additional ﬁle 5: Table S4). The
expression levels of 0X11, MEKKI, MKK4, MPK3, Zat12, WRKY22 and WRKY25 were
increased 38, 8, 5, 6, 8, 18 and 3-f01d, respectively, in the spaee-grown Mizuna (Figure 3).
This result correlates with that of mRNA-Seq, supporting the predicted active MAPK cascade
and transcription factor genes under the spaceﬂight environment.

Figure 3 Expression of the predicted active MAPK cascade and transcription factor
genes in the space—grown Mizuna by qRT-PCR. Expression levels of the predicted active
genes, 0X11, MEKKI, MKK4, MPK3, Zat12, WRKY22 and WRKY25 in the space-grown
and the ground-grown Mizuna were analyzed by qRT-PCR. Expression levels of genes in the
space-grown and the ground-grown Mizuna were normalized with that of the a-tubulin gene
as an internal control. The error bar represents standard error of the mean for three RNA
isolation experiments.

Expression proﬁles of ROS—producing genes

Reactive oxygen species are used as a signal molecular in plants to amplify the ROS signal
network to activate defense mechanisms against abiotic and biotic stress [18]. NADPH
oxidases play a key role in producing ROS. RbohD and Rbth genes of NADPH oxidases in
Arabidopsis were induced by oxidative stress, leading to maintain the stress defense system
[18,33]. There were 7 NADPH oxidase genes identiﬁed in spaee-grown Mizuna and RbohD
(Bra020724) and Rbth (Bra027764) genes were up—regulated by 3.0-fold and 5.1-fold,
respectively (Table 3). This result suggests that space-grown Mizuna produces ROS to
maintain the activation of ROS signal network to control the defense system with ROS-
scavenging system.

Conclusions

Plants respond to environmental stress in multiple ways and have evolved mechanisms to
increase their tolerance to the stress through interactive molecular and cellular changes. The
components of these changes are responses of integrated ROS gene network triggered under

"
"11","stressful conditions. Our large-scale transcriptcme analysis demonstrated that the spaceﬂight
environment induced oxidative stress and activated a ROS gene network in the space-grcwn
Mizuna, some of which were common genes up—regulated by abictic and biotic stress and
some of which were preferentially up-regulated genes by the spaceﬂight environment, even
though Mizuna grew in the space as well as on the ground. Up—regulaticn 0f AOX, RbchD,
and RbchF genes, activation of more than one MAPK cascades, and regulation of Zat7 and
WRKY70 by Zat12 are common in plants under space, abictic, biotic stress. Preferential high
expression of thioredoxin and glutaredcxin genes, n0 repression of WRKY25, WRKY33, and
Zat12 by MEKK1-MKK1/MKK2-MPK4 cascade, and n0 induction of 0X11 by PLC/D-PA-
PDK1 pathway are different from those under abictic and biotic stress. These results show
that the ROS gene network for abictic and biotic stress response and tolerance, which plants
have developed to adapt the environment on the earth, could serve to acclimate plant to the
abictic stress conditions of the spaceﬂight environment.

Methods

Plant cultivation and spaceﬂight

Seeds of Mizuna, Brassica rapa var. nipposinica, were transported to 188. Ten-15 seeds were
set in each of two root modules of the Lada growth chambers aboard the Zvezda module of
188 [14,15], and allowed to germinate. Lada consists of a control module, a water reservoir
and 2 growth chambers which include a root module, leaf chamber and light module
(Additional ﬁle 6: Figure S2). The light banks house two cool white ﬂourescent lamps
providing approximately 125 -25 0 nmol m'2 s'1 (depending on plant height) photosynthetically
active radiation (PAR). In the overall Lada experiment, two root module growth substrate
mixtures were used to determine which was optimal for plant growth. One mixture contained
rinsed and dried arcillite (Turface Prcleague, Proﬁle LLC, Buffalo Grove IL, US) with 15
grams of 14-14-14 Osmcccte fertilizer, the other, nutrient solution soaked and dried arcillite
with 14 grams of a custom mixed Nutriccte fertilizer. The Lada moisture level control point
was set at 85% at the start of the experiment for both root modules. One of the root modules
experienced an over-watering event in which the pump failed to stop when the moisture
sensors reached 85% and almost 2 liters of water was added in 35 hours. Automatic watering
was disabled and the pump was operated manually for the duration of the experiment. This
was duplicated in the ground controls. Because of the difference in watering regimes, only
the plant tissue from the Osmcccte fertilized root modules with manually controlled
watering, both ﬂight and ground controls, were used for this study. The plants were grown in
Lada under 24 hr lighting. The average environmental conditions measured from the Zvezda
module of the 188 over the duration of the experiment and duplicated for the ground controls
were 24.3 i 08°C, 3.27 i 0.46 mm Hg pp C02, (= 4,303 i 605 ppm C02) and 40.7 i 6.9%
RH. The average recorded values for the ground control experiment were 24.5 i 0.5 0C, 4,254
i 566 ppm CO2 , and 41.2 i 2.6 RH. After 27 days of cultivation, the plants were harvested
and stored at -80°C in the MELFI freezer onboard the Destiny module, and were transported
to the ground at < -20°C in the GLACIER cold stowage system aboard the Space Shuttle. The
total radiation dose during cultivation was 8.37 mGy.

RNA preparation, mRNA-Seq analysis and identiﬁcation of responsive
transcripts

Total RNA from leaves samples was extracted using the RNeasy Plant Mini kit (Qiagen,
Hilden, Germany) and cDNA library was constructed using the TruSeqTM RNA sample

"
"12","preparation kit (Illumina, San Diego, CA, USA). Sequencing was performed 011 each library
to generate 100-bp paired-end reads for transeriptome sequencing 0n Illumina Genome
Analyzer IIX platform. Stretches of low quality bases at both sides of reads were trimmed
using a customized C program (Q value < 15). Adapter sequences were removed using
eutadapt (ver. 1.0; http://code.g00gle.com/p/cutadapt/) with parameters ‘-e 0.1 -O 5 -m 20’
[34]. After pre-processing the Illumina reads, the transcript structures were reconstructed
using a series of programs, namely, Bowtie 2 (ver. 2-2.0.0-beta7; http://b0wtie-
bio.soureeforge.net/bowtieZ/index.shtml) for short-read mapping [35], TOpHat (ver. 2.05;
http://t0phat.ebeb.umd.edu/) for deﬁning exon-intron junctions [36], and Cufﬂinks (ver.
2.02; http://eufﬂinks.cbcb.urnd.edu/) for gene structure predictions [37]. For TOpHat, the
Reference-Brassica rapa (Chiifu-401) genome (Phytozome; http://www.phytozome.net/) was
used as the reference sequences with the following options: --n0-diseordant --n0-mixed -r 46
--mate-std-deV 133 [38].

The expression level for each transcript was calculated as reads per kilobase of exon model
per million mapped (RPKM) values based on the number of uniquely mapped reads that
completely overlap with the exonie regions in each library [39]. The signiﬁcantly
differentially expressed transcripts between space- and ground-grown samples were detected
by G-test (FDR < 0.001). Fold changes of expression levels between samples were calculated
after adding one to each RPKM value to avoid division by zero.

Gene ontology analysis

The G0 terms assigned to the responsive transcripts were obtained from InterProScan 5
Release Candidate 2 (http://code.g00gle.com/p/interproscam) with the parameters ‘-f tsv -t p -
dp —g0terrns’ for each transcript [40].

GO enrichment analysis

GO enrichment was evaluated for responsive transcripts using Fischer’s exact test with a
FDR threshold of 5% using R ver. 2.13.0 (http://www.R-pr0j eet.0rg).

Quantitative RT-PCR (qRT-PCR)

P01y(A)+ RNA was purified from total RNA with the Poly (A) Purist MAG (Ambion, Texas,
USA) and 1st strand CDNA was synthesized from poly(A)+ RNA with the PrimeScript ﬁrst
strand CDNA Synthesis Kit (Takara Bio, J apan) according to the manufacture’s instruction.
qRT-PCR was performed in a mixture of 10 [11 containing 1st strand CDNA, SYBR PremiX
EX Taq (Takara Bio, J apan), and 0.2 pmol each primer combination (Additional ﬁle 5: Table
S4) using the LightCyeler 2.0 (Roche Applied Science, Mannheim, Germany). The thermal
cycle proﬁle was lcyele of 95°C for 10 sec followed by 40 cycles of 95 °C for 5 sec, 60°C for
20 sec. The CDNA quantities of each gene were calculated using LightCycler 4.0 software
and the transcript expression levels were normalized with that of the a-tubulin gene as an
internal control. Three technical replicate for each RNA were used for analysis. Speciﬁcity of
primer combination was conﬁrmed by melting curve of the PCR products and agarose gel
electrophoresis (Additional ﬁle 4: Figure SI).
