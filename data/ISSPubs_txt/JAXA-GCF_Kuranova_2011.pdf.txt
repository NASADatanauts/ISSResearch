Abstract—Crystals 0f phosphopantetheine adenylyltransferase from Mycobacterium tuberculosis, thymidine
phosphorylase from Escherichia 6011', carboxypeptidase T from T hermoacz‘inomyces vulgaris and its mutant
forms, and crystals of complexes of these proteins with functional ligands and inhibitors were grown by the
capillary counter—diffusion method in the J apanese Experimental Module Kibo 0n the International Space
Station. The high—resolution X—ray diffraction data sets suitable for the determination of high—resolution
three—dimensional structures of these proteins were collected from the grown crystals on the SPring—8 syn—
chrotron radiation facility. The conditions of crystal growth for the proteins and the data—collection statistics
are reported. The crystals grown in microgravity diffracted to a higher resolution than crystals of the same
proteins grown on Earth.
