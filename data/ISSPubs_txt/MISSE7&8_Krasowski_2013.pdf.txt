The Communications Interface Board (CIB) is an improved communications architecture that was demonstrated on the Interna-
tional Space Station (188). 188 communication interfaces allowing for real-time telemetry and health monitoring require a signiﬁ-
cant amount of development. The CIB simpliﬁes the communications interface to the 188 for real-time health monitoring, telemetry,
and control of resident sensors or experiments. With a simpler interface available to the telemetry bus, more sensors or experiments
may be ﬂown. The CIB accomplishes this by acting as a bridge between the ISS MIL-STD-1553 low-rate telemetry (LRT) bus and the
sensors allowing for two-way command and telemetry data transfer. The CIB was designed to be highly reliable and radiation hard
for an extended ﬂight in low Earth orbit (LEO) and has been proven with over 40 months of ﬂight operation on the outside of ISS
supporting two sets of ﬂight experiments. Since the CIB is currently operating in ﬂight on the 188, recent results of operations will be
provided. Additionally, as a vehicle health monitoring enabling technology, an overview and results from two experiments enabled
by the CIB will be provided. Future applications for vehicle health monitoring utilizing the CIB architecture will also be discussed.
