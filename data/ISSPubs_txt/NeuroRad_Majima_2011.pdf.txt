Abstract: It is well known that vitamin E functions as an antioxidant, and it is expected to exert an antioxidant effect when taken as a
supplement. However, a number of cohort studies have shown that vitamin B does not alleviate oxidative stress and could even worsen it. '
Recently, Wang et al. investigated whether vitamin E intake was associated with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) based on data from 1
5 cohort studies with 1,055,546 participants, of which 805 of them had developed ALS. They concluded in this large pooled prospective
study, in which long-term vitamin E supplementation was associated with lower ALS rates, and therefore, a possible protective effect of
vitamin E deserves further consideration. Performing further large cohort studies may reveal similar ﬁndings for other oxidative stress—
related diseases. It is still controversial if antioxidants such as vitamin E provide a clinical therapeutic effect against oxidative stress- ; “
related diseases. If effective, the dose at which they should be administered and the duration of supplement exposure should be of inter-
est. Vitamin E reduces production of reactive oxygen species by mitochondria and elicits further reactions in cells. It should be noted that ,
mitochondria are important targets for vitamin E and its homologues. Therefore, a proper usage of vitamin E in subjects under high oxi- .
dative stress, due to its individually targeting property, will arise its importance in healthy life. ' 4

ROS are also generated by the mitochondrial electron transport chain in normal physiological conditions.
B. Tumor cells: Tumor cells generate more ROS than normal cells. Suppression of the tumor’s malignant phenotype and cure of the tumor might be obtained
by suppression of ROS generation through the administration of vitamin E and its homologues. A new vitamin E homologue, a-TOS (MITOCANS), is not an
anti-oxidant, but inhibits the activity of succinate dehydrogenase in complex 11 by interacting with the proximal and distal ubiquinone binding sites (QP and
