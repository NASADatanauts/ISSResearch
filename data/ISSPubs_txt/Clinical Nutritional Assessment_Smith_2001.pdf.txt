ABSTRACT Adequate nutrition is critical during Iong-term spaceflight, as is the ability to easily monitor dietary
intake. A comprehensive nutritional status assessment profile was designed for use before, during and after flight.
It included assessment of both dietary intake and biochemical markers of nutritional status. A spaceflight
food-frequency questionnaire (FFQ) was developed to evaluate intake of key nutrients during spaceflight. The
nutritional status assessment protocol was evaluated during two ground-based closed-chamber studies (60 and
91 d; n = 4/study), and was implemented for two astronauts during 4-mo stays on the Mir space station.
Ground-based studies indicated that the FFQ, administered daily or weekly, adequately estimated intake of key
nutrients. Chamber subjects maintained prechamber energy intake and body weight. Astronauts tended to eat
40—50% of WHO-predicted energy requirements, and lost >10% of preflight body mass. Serum ferritin levels were
lower after the chamber stays, despite adequate iron intake. Red blood cell folate concentrations were increased
after the chamber studies. Vitamin D stores were decreased by > 40% on chamber egress and after spaceflight.
Mir crew members had decreased levels of most nutritional indices, but these are difficult to interpret given the
insufficient energy intake and loss of body mass. Spaceflight food systems can provide adequate intake of
macronutrients, although, as expected, micronutrient intake is a concern for any closed or semiclosed food
system. These data demonstrate the utility and importance of nutritional status assessment during spaceflight and
of the FFQ during extended-duration spaceflight. J. Nutr. 131: 2053—2061, 2001.
