"1","Marked Exacerbation of Orthostatic Intolerance After Long- vs. Short-Duration
Spacefllght In Veteran Astronauts

Objective: The incidence of postﬂight orthostatio intolerance after short—duration spaceﬂight is about 20%. How-
ever, the incidence after long—duration spaceﬂight was unknown. The purpose of this study was to test the
hypothesis that orthostatio intolerance is more severe after long—duration than after short—duration ﬂight. Methods:
We performed tilt tests on six astronauts before and after long—duration (129—190 days) spaceﬂights and compared
these data with data obtained during stand tests before and after previous short—duration missions. Results: Five of
the six astronauts studied became presynoopal during tilt testing after long—duration ﬂights. Only one had become
presynoopal during stand testing after short—duration ﬂights. We also compared the long—duration ﬂight tilt test data
to tilt test data from 20 different astronauts who ﬂew on the short—duration Shuttle missions that delivered and
recovered the astronauts to and from the Mir Space Station. Five of these 20 astronauts became presynoopal on
landing day. Heart rate responses to tilt were no different between astronauts on long—duration ﬂights and astronauts
on short—duration ﬂights, but long—duration subjects had lower stroke volumes and cardiac outputs than short—
duration presynoopal subjects, suggesting a possible decrease in cardiac contractile function. One subject had
subnormal norepinephrine release with upright posture after the long ﬂight but not after the short ﬂight. Plasma
volume losses were not greater after long ﬂights. Conclusion: Long—duration spaceﬂight markedly increases
