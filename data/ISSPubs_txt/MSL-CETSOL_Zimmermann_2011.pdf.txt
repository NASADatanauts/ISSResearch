Abstract. Grain structures Observed in most casting processes of metallic alloys are the result
of a competition between the growth of several arrays of dendrites that develop under
constrained and unconstrained conditions. Often this leads to a transition from columnar t0
equiaxed grain growth during solidiﬁcation (CET). A microgravity environment results in
suppression of buoyancy-driven melt ﬂow and s0 enables growth of equiaxed grains free of
sedimentation and buoyancy effects. This contribution presents ﬁrst results Obtained in
experiments on-board the International Space Station (188), which were performed in the
frame of the ESA-MAP programme CETSOL. Hypoeutectic aluminium-silicon alloys with and
without grain reﬁners were processed successfully in a low gradient furnace (MSL-LGF). First
analysis shows that in the non grain reﬁned samples columnar dendritic growth exists, whereas
CET is Observed in the grain reﬁned samples. From analysis Of the thermal data and the grain
structure the critical parameters for the temperature gradient and the cooling rate describing
CET are determined. These data are used for initial numerical simulations to predict the
position of the columnar-tO-equiaxed transition and will form a unique database for calibration
and further development of numerical CET-modeling.
1. Introduction
Grain structures observed in most casting processes of metallic alloys are the result of a competition
between the growth of several arrays of dendrites that develop under constrained and unconstrained
conditions. Figure 1 schematically shows the solidiﬁcation of a metallic melt in a mould. Typically for
a high cooling rate at the beginning directional growth of columnar dendritic grains from the side
walls is initiated. During solidiﬁcation the temperature difference between the melt and the mould is
reduced and the cooling rate decreases. This often leads to nucleation and growth of equiaxed grains in
the undercooled melt. This effect is described as a columnar-to-equiaxed transition (CET) and was
investigated intensively in the last decades [1-12].

On ground a far-reaehing effect of the buoyancy-driven ﬂow is observed. This leads to relative
transport of the equiaxed crystals and ﬂow-indueed maerosegregation. It results in difﬁculties in
conducting precise investigations on the origin of the formation of the equiaxed crystals and their
interaction with the development of the columnar grain structure.

A microgravity environment allows for suppression of buoyancy-driven melt ﬂow and so for
growth of equiaxed grains free of sedimentation and buoyancy effects. Therefore, experiments in
microgravity provide unique data for testing fundamental theories of grain structure formation [13-14].
To carry out such experiments and to model the process of columnar t0 equiaxed transition is the topic
of the research project Qolumnar-tO-Equiaxed Iransition in SOLidiﬁeation Processing (CETSOL) in
the framework of the Mierogravity Application Bromotion (MAP) programme of the European §paee
Agency (ESA). At present the CETSOL team consists of four European scientiﬁc partners assisted by
ﬁve partners from industry.

2. Set—up 0f the microgravity experiments

To investigate the eolumnar-to—equiaxed transition under diffusive conditions for heat and mass
transport, experiments in microgravity were performed and will be performed. In 2006 the
microgravity experiment MACE (Metallic Alloys for Qolumnar-Equiaxed Transition) was carried out
in the experimental module TEM 01-2M during MAXUS-7 sounding rocket mission. Within this
campaign three A1-7wt%Si samples were processed successfully. As a result the apparent effect of
TiBz grain reﬁner particles in the alloy was to lower the critical undereooling for heterogeneous
nucleation of primary equiaxed Al-dendrites in the bulk; CET was thus present at higher gradients and
lower front velocities. Also, a signiﬁcant delay of CET is observed on ground compared to the
experiments performed in reduced gravity environment [15-19].

In continuation of these investigations experiments in microgravity were deﬁned and successfully
performed in the Materials Science Laboratory (MSL) with the Low Gradient Furnace (LGF) module
onboard the International Space Station (188). For a Bateh#1 the CETSOL team selected 6
experiments to investigate CET behaviour in microgravity. The AISi7 sample material with and
without grain reﬁner particles was provided by Hydro Aluminium Deutschland GmbH. Rod-like
samples with diameter 7.8 mm and length 245 mm were integrated into ﬂight cartridges by industry
(EADS Astrium / Soterem). Figure 2 shows a sketch of the sample cartridge assembly (SCA) located

in the furnace (LGF). The metallic Al-7wt%Si alloy is enclosed in a protective alumina tubular
oruoible with Shapal plugs and boron nitride spacers at both ends. The oonioal shape of the upper
Shapal plug acts as passive volume compensation device during heating-up and melting of the alloy.
At the outer surface of the alumina tube 4 longitudinal grooves were manufactured. In each groove 3
thermocouples at different aXial positions were placed. This allows measuring the temperature proﬁle
along the sample aXis within the crucible walls. The whole set-up is inserted leak—tight in a tantalum
tube and ﬁlled with 200 mbar helium. For sample processing the cartridge is inserted into the low
gradient furnace (LGF). The main parts of the LGF are the relatively oold zone which consists of 3
heaters H1 to H3, the hot zone which consists of 4 heaters, and an adiabatic zone in between (see
ﬁgure 2). By controlling the temperatures of the cold and the hot zone a temperature gradient along the
sample aXis develops. Melting or solidiﬁcation of the metallic alloy is realized by a movement of the
furnace insert along the aXis of the ﬁxed sample with a deﬁned speed. The situation in ﬁgure 2 shows
the furnace at its very left position (zero furnace position), which corresponds to the maximum melting
position of the sample at the beginning of the solidiﬁcation phase.

Table 1 summarizes the main parameters of the ﬂight experiments. In samples FM#3 and FM#4
non-reﬁned AlSi7 alloys were used, while all other samples contain 0.5wt% of TiBz for grain
reﬁnement. At furnace position 80mm the temperatures of all heaters were increased to 5000C,
followed by a further increase to 5400C for the 3 heaters of the cold zone and to 6600C for the 4
heaters of the hot zone. With this a temperature proﬁle was established along the sample aXis resulting
in a partly melting of the Al-7wt%Si alloy in the hot zone region. Moving the furnace at a speed of
80um/s to the end position (as shown in ﬁgure 2), directional melting of the sample was initiated.
With an additional increase of the temperatures of all heaters Via teleoommand by 30K the solid-liquid
region of the sample was centred in the adiabatic zone of the furnace. From the temperature
measurements along the sample aXis a temperature gradient of about 0.9K/mm at the liquidus
temperature of 6180C was determined. This procedure was identical for all ﬂight experiments to allow
meaningful comparison of the experimental results.

After reaching thermal equilibrium the solidification process was started following different
thermal homogenization times tH. A short homogenization time of about 10 minutes just stabilizes the
temperature proﬁle. During a waiting period of 5 hours a diffusive coarsening process in the mushy
zone region is expected, which may result in an aXial segregation of silicon due to a temperature
gradient zone melting (TGZM) effect [20].

The ﬁrst solidiﬁcation phase was identical for all experiments (see table 1). A furnace movement
with v1=10pm/s for zI=20mm is expected to generate a columnar dendritie growth. A transition to
equiaxed growth should be triggered in the second 50mm solidiﬁcation phase of furnace movement.
Therefore the temperatures of the heaters in the hot zone were decreased at dT/dt=4K/min.
Additionally, in the experiments FM#1 to FM#3 the furnace speed is increased to v2=200pm/s. Finally
a fast movement of the furnace with v3=3000pm/s to its end position and a shut down of the heaters
stops the experiment.

The ﬂight experiments have been performed from November 2009 until April 2010 on the 188. The
processed cartridges have been downloaded with Space Shuttles and de-integrated by industry,
followed by scientiﬁc evaluation of the CETSOL team. First results are presented in the next chapter.
3. CETSOLl Batch#1 microgravity experiments
The performance of the ﬂight samples consists of several steps which were agreed by the CETSOL
team partners to achieve as much scientiﬁc output as possible. The main items can be summarized as
follows:
3 .I . Process parameters
The critical phases of each microgravity experiment, i.e. the homogenization and solidiﬁcation phases,
were performed during sleeping periods of the astronauts on the ISS. Thereby a microgravity level
without larger disturbances was expected. The evaluation of the data of the graVity sensors close to the
MSL rack conﬁrms that a graVity level below i0.5X10'3g0 was achieved during all experiments, where
g0=9.8m/s2 is the standard terrestrial value.
The housekeeping data — mainly heater and sample temperatures as well as the furnace movement
— were controlled on-line during the experiments. This monitoring at the MicrograVity User Support
Centre (MUSC/DLR) in Cologne (Germany) also allowed the scientist to adjust the heater
temperatures to shift the solid-liquid interface position in the metallic sample into the adiabatic zone of
the MSL-LGF furnace. As an example ﬁgure 3 shows the temperatures of the 12 thermocouples which
are placed along the sample with distances between two neighbouring thermocouples of 10mm. The
position of the ﬁrst thermocouple SCAtemp_te_01 is 72mm from the non-molten end of the metallic
sample. The diagram aXis on the right side in ﬁgure 3 indicates the furnace position s. The graphs
correspond to the solidiﬁcation phases for experiment FM#2, starting with a furnace movement of
v1=10pm/s at t=273 80s, an increase to v2=200pm/s at t=29395s and ﬁnally a fast movement at

3.2. Non-destructive sample analysis
The next stage of evaluation is a non-destructive analysis of the processed samples using 3D computer
tomography. As a result no macroscopic shrinkage holes were detected. This indicates that the volume
compensation mechanism worked reliably. In the samples with short homogenization times of about
10min some pores with sizes up to 500nm were identiﬁed, mainly in the mushy zone region. This fact
has to be taken into account for further analysis.

Figure 4 shows an image of the processed FM#2 ﬂight sample after extraction from the alumina
crucible. The maximum melting position at z=68mm can be identiﬁed, which separates the non-molten
region and the mushy zone region. The adjacent solidiﬁcation phases are also shown qualitatively.

3.3. Microstructure and grain structure evaluation

For analyzing the microstructure and the grain structure the samples have to be sectioned. First, the
samples were cut into pieces of length 30mm to analyze the transversal cross-sections Qi (see ﬁgure
4). Second, each of these pieces was sawed along the axis to get two halves for analysis of the
longitudinal cross-sections Li. To determine the microstructure the samples were polished and etched
and observed with a microscope. To identify the grain structure the cross-sections were electrolytically
etched and analysed in a polarized light microscope. Then, different colours represent different
crystallographic orientations of the dendritic grains [21].

Figure 5 shows the longitudinal cross-sections L3 0f FM#2 and FM#3 ﬂight samples (for notation
see ﬁgure 4). The lengths of the cross-sections are 30mm, the position values are referred to the non-
molten end of each sample with a difference of 7mm between the FM#2 and FM#3 ﬂight samples.
Such a difference can be explained by small temperature differences (about 6K) within the two
samples in the very ﬂat gradient. The left part of each cross-section shows the developed mushy zone
region. As a result of the long thermal homogenization of 5 hours in a temperature gradient (see table
1) coarsening of the primary Al-rich dendrites eXists. Between reﬁned (FM#2) and non-reﬁned
(FM#3) alloy no signiﬁcant difference of the mushy zone structure is detected. After the thermal
homogenization the directional solidiﬁcation with v1=10um/s was started. The development of a
dendritic microstructure is shown in the right part of the cross-sections (ﬁgure 5). Starting from
several nuclei in both samples, the non-reﬁned alloy (FM#3) shows a more pronounced columnar
structure than the reﬁned alloy (FM#2). Concerning the grain size and grain density no substantial
difference is found.

Figure 6 shows the cross-sections L4 of samples FM#2 and FM#3. The increase of the furnace
velocity from v1=10pm/s t0 v2=200pm/s results in the development of a ﬁner columnar dendritic
microstructure in the non-reﬁned alloy (FM#3) Whereas the grain reﬁned alloy (FM#2) shows a
transition to equiaxed grain growth.

The differences in the microstructures and grain structures are also evident in the transversal cross-
sections Q4 given in ﬁgure 7. Sample FM#3 shows a regular dendritic microstructure. The uniform
color of the electrolytically etched image indicates the columnar growth of nearly one single grain. In
the grain reﬁned sample FM#2 however many grains With different orientations were identiﬁed.

were measured using digital image analysis. The average grain size along the sample axis is given in
ﬁgure 8, averaging was performed over all grains being totally or partly Within a sheet of i2mm
around the actual position. The maximum value corresponds to columnar growth of just two large
grains in the ﬁrst solidiﬁcation phase. Equiaxed growth is characterized by a signiﬁcant decrease of
the average grain size. Thus, based on this criterion and this type of evaluation, the position of CET is
determined at z=126i2mm.

Figure 7. Transversal cross-sections Q4 of the Batch#1 ﬂight samples FM#3 (top) and FM#2 showing
the dendritic microstructure (left) and the corresponding grain structure (right).

The relevant parameters — critical temperature gradient and critical velocity of the isotherm at CET
— have to be determined from the temperature measurements along the sample aXis.

To estimate the critical isotherm velocity the local cooling rate is determined. Figure 9 shows the
temperature and calculated cooling rate of thermocouple SCAtemp_tc_07. This thermocouple is
located at position z=132mm in the alumina crucible. This position is about 6mm ahead of the
measured position of CET in the sample and is assumed to be representative for the thermal behaviour
in the undercooled region ahead of the columnar front at CET. At about t=29500s the temperature of
the thermocouple reaches the liquidus temperature of the alloy (T L=618°C). Assuming a front
undercooling of about 6K this temperature is reached at about t=29600s. The corresponding cooling
rate in this time period is rather constant at 0.065K/s.

During the second solidiﬁcation phase with a furnace movement of v2=200tIm/s a slight decrease of
the temperature gradient is measured. Assuming CET at t=29600s the critical temperature gradient is
about GC=0.75K/mm. As a result the critical isotherm velocity is calculated from the critical values for
the gradient and the cooling rate as about V0287Mm/S.

3.5 Numericalprediction OfCETpOSition
The modelling approach [12] that combines Front Tracking (FT) of columnar growth [5] and an
equiaxed volume averaging method [22] was employed to simulate the FM#2 experiment. Among the
key advantages related to this approach are: the ability to explicitly track the undereooled columnar
front; the capacity to model equiaxed nucleation from grain reﬁners and subsequent unconstrained
growth; high computational efﬁciency for modeling equiaxed solidiﬁcation in this range of equiaxed
grain sizes; and the macroscopic nature of CET.

The combined model needs to solve the macroscopic energy equation with appropriate latent heat
source terms which come from the simulation of columnar and equiaxed growth. The columnar
growth initiation from initial solid/mush is considered. The model tracks the evolution of the columnar
dendritie front over the relevant period. In this simulation, the columnar front is assumed to commence
its growth from the mushy zone (at the liquidus isotherm of the A1—7wt%Si alloy) that eXists when
cooling (solidiﬁcation) begins. Therefore, the initial position of the computational markers that
represent the columnar front was set at the computed temperature proﬁle’s liquidus isotherm. In the
undereooled liquid, ahead of the columnar front, the possibility of equiaxed nucleation from grain
reﬁners is considered. A log-normal distribution for grain reﬁner size [23, 24] is used to compute the
number of potential equiaxed nucleation sites at a given time using the computed site temperature.
More details of the equiaxed nucleation model employed are available elsewhere [22].

The simulation domain is a 132mm long section from the experimental sample and starts at
position z=61.5mm (zero position corresponds to solid sample end). To deﬁne the thermal boundary
conditions for the simulations, thermal data recorded during the experiment on the 188 was used. As

mentioned in the experimental section, thermal data is collected from 12 thermocouple positions at 10
second intervals. Intermediate spatial and temporal input data values used to feed the model simulation
were linearly interpolated. A pre-eXperiment chemical analysis showed that the FM#2 sample
contained 30 ppm boron and 225 ppm Ti. We assumed that (i) all boron atoms appeared in TiBz grain
reﬁner particles and (ii) a nearly 1% efﬁciency of such TiBz grain reﬁners. The effective TiBz density
in the sample was computed as 1.25/mm3 using the previous literature [23, 24]. Considering that a
slice with thickness equal to half of the average equiaxed dendrite diameter contributes to the 2D
View, the input grain reﬁner density for the 2D model is obtained Via multiplying the 3D grain reﬁner
density value by a factor equal to 0.75mm'1 (the as-east average equiaxed dendrite diameter is
approximately 1.5mm).

Alloy related thermo-physieal properties, for both solid and liquid phases, and the dendrite kinetics
growth law (tip velocity-undereooling relationship) were taken from ref. [4]. Predicted as-east
columnar and equiaxed volume fractions together with CET position from the model simulation are
presented in ﬁgure 11. The zoomed-in section of ﬁgure 11 can be directly compared with the FM#2 -
L4 section of ﬁgure 6.

The section between z=120mm to z=150mm is magniﬁed.

As mentioned in chapter 3.4, CET for FM#2 experiment was determined at z=126i2 mm. In the
model simulation, CET is predicted at a distance of z=127.5mm. Hence a strong agreement between
model simulation and experiment was found. The columnar length is approximately equal to the
distance that the furnace moved at the lower velocity (v1) and relatively high thermal gradient (see
ﬁgure 10) suggesting that CET is related to the velocity jump. However, under a similar velocity
jump, FM#3 has not shown a CET. Therefore, the inﬂuence of grain reﬁners needs to be evaluated
carefully Via with further modeling.

4. Summary

This paper reports on ﬁrst results obtained during metallic alloy solidiﬁcation experiments onboard the
International Space Station in the Materials Science Laboratory using the Low Gradient Furnace
module. Within Bateh#1 a set of siX experiments with Al-7wt%Si alloy were performed successfully
to investigate eolumnar-to-equiaxed (CET) solidiﬁcation behaviour in microgravity. Mainly the
impact of grain reﬁner particles in the alloy and different cooling rates on CET were investigated. First
evaluations show that in the non grain reﬁned samples columnar dendritie growth persists throughout,

Whereas CET is observed in the grain reﬁned samples. Here, the microgravity environment allows for

pure diffusive conditions for heat and mass transfer in the melt and therefore for investigation of CET

Without buoyancy convection and sedimentation of equiaxed grains in the melt. The determination of

critical parameters for CET from analysis of thermal data and the grain structure Will be used for

calibration and further development of numerical model predicting CET.

At present a second set of microgravity experiments is in preparation. Within the Bateh#2a a set of
seven experiments With A1—7wt%Si alloy Will be processed in the MSL using the Solidiﬁeation and
Quenching Furnace module (SQF). This furnace allows for higher temperature gradients and cooling
rates and therefore resulting in an extension of the data basis concerning CET.
