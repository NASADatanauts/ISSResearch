ABSTRACT
Forty-one different polymer samples, collectively called the Polymer Erosion and Contamination Experiment
(PEACE) Polymers, were exposed to the low Earth orbit (LEO) environment on the exterior of the International
Space Station (188) for nearly four years as part of the Materials International Space Station Experiment 2 (MISSE
2). The objective of the PEACE Polymers experiment was to determine the atomic oxygen erosion yield of a wide
variety of polymeric materials after long term exposure to the space environment. The polymers range from those
commonly used for spacecraft applications to more recently developed polymers. Additional polymers, not
considered for spacecraft applications, were included to explore erosion yield dependence upon chemical
composition. The polymers were typically in thin-ﬁlm form (25 to 500 pm thick) and depending on the polymer
thickness and estimated erosion yield, stacking of numerous thin ﬁlm sample layers was often necessary. Several
thick single layer materials, such as epoxy and pyrolytic graphite, were also included. The PEACE Polymers
experiment was ﬂown in MISSE Passive Experiment Container 2 (PEC 2) on the exterior of the ISS Quest Airlock
and was exposed to ram atomic oxygen, along with solar and charged particle radiation, for the majority of the
mission; hence the polymers typically developed very diffuse textures. The average atomic oxygen ﬁuence was
8.43 X 1021 atoms/cmz. This paper documents the erosion morphology of numerous MISSE 2 PEACE polymer
samples. Erosion cone structures were examined for high and low erosion yield samples. Also examined were the
erosion characteristics for thin ﬁlm polymers eroded through several layers. Of particular interest was
documentation of the erosion of a thin ﬁlm polymer outer layer at cone valleys, and the corresponding erosion
morphology of the underlying layer. This information is relevant to the durability of materials and components on
spacecraft that are protected by thin ﬁlm polymers. The MISSE 2 PEACE Polymers experiment is unique because it
has the widest variety of polymers ﬂown collectively in LEO for a long duration and was exposed to an unusually
clean LEO spacecraft environment. This paper provides high ﬂuence ram atomic oxygen erosion morphology data
applicable to spacecraft durability.

1. INTRODUCTION
Forty-one different polymer samples, collectively called the Polymer Erosion and Contamination Experiment
(PEACE) Polymers, were exposed to the low Earth orbit (LEO) environment on the exterior of the International
Space Station (188) for nearly four years as part of the Materials International Space Station Experiment 2 (MISSE
2).[l,2] The objective of the MISSE 2 PEACE Polymers experiment was to determine the atomic oxygen erosion
yield, or volume loss per incident oxygen atom (cm3/atom), of a wide variety of polymeric materials after long term
exposure to the space environment. The polymers range from those commonly used for spacecraft applications to
more recently developed polymers. Additional polymers, not considered for spacecraft applications, were also
included to explore erosion yield dependence upon chemical composition for atomic oxygen erosion predictive tool
development. The polymers were typically in thin ﬁlm form (25 to 500 pm thick) and depending on the polymer
thickness and estimated erosion yield, stacking of numerous thin ﬁlm sample layers was often necessary.[l,2]
Several thick single layer materials, such pyrolytic graphite, were also included.

"2","The MISSE 2 PEACE Polymers experiment was exposed to ram atomic oxygen, along with solar and charged
particle radiation, for the maj ority of the four year mission. Extensive erosion occurred in many of the samples, and
the maj ority of the samples developed diffuse textures. This paper documents the erosion morphology of numerous
MISSE 2 PEACE polymer samples. Erosion cone structures were examined for both high and low erosion yield
samples. Also examined were the erosion characteristics for thin ﬁlm polymers eroded through several layers. Of
particular interest was documentation of the erosion of a thin ﬁlm polymer outer layer at cone valleys, and the
corresponding erosion morphology of the underlying layer. This information is relevant to the durability of materials
and components on spacecraft that are protected by thin ﬁlm polymers. Energy dispersive spectroscopy (EDS) was
used to look for the presence of any surface contaminants, particularly on low erosion yield samples, and to examine
the composition of non—volatile ash residue. The erosion yield of numerous samples was computed based on
recession depth measurements and compared to the values obtained using mass loss. This paper provides high
ﬂuence ram atomic oxygen erosion morphology data applicable to spacecraft durability.
2. MATERIALS INTERNATIONAL SPACE STATION EXPERIMENT 2 (MISSE 2)
The MISSE program consists of suitcase—like trays, called Passive Experiment Containers (PECs), exposed to the
space enVironment on the exterior of the International Space Station (188). The MISSE trays are retrieved and
returned to Earth enabling post—ﬂight experiment evaluation. The trays are positioned in either a ram/wake
orientation or in a zenith/nadir orientation. The MISSE 2 PEACE Polymers experiment is a passive experiment that
was ﬂown in MISSE PEC 2, tray 1 (ram side), sample tray E5. MISSE 1 & 2 were transported to the ISS, and
MISSE 2 was attached to the exterior of the Quest Airlock on August 16, 2001 during the Discovery STS—105
shuttle mission. Figure 1 is a photograph of the Quest Airlock showing the location of MISSE PEC 2. Although
originally planned as a 1—year mission, retrieval of MISSE 1 & 2 was signiﬁcantly delayed due to the Columbia
Shuttle accident. MISSE 1 & 2 were successfully retrieved during a space walk on July 30, 2005 during
Discovery’s STS—l 14 Return to Flight mission after 3.95 years of space exposure. While on—orbit, MISSE PEC 2
tray 1 was exposed to ram atomic oxygen, along with solar and charged particle radiation, for the majority of the
four year mission. Details on the speciﬁc polymers ﬂown, ﬂight sample fabrication, pre— and post—ﬂight
characterization techniques, atomic oxygen ﬂuence calculations, and a summary of the atomic oxygen erosion yield
results based on mass loss measurements are reported by de Groh. [1,2]

Estimated environmental conditions of solar exposure, tray temperatures, and ionizing radiation doses on MISSE 1
& 2 are described in detail by Pippin.[3] For the PEC 2 tray 1 the total equivalent sun hours (ESH) was estimated to
be 5,000—6,700 ESH. This total includes Earth—reﬂected illumination (650—820 ESH). Tray E5 was computed to
have received approximately 6,300 ESH.[3] The 3.95 year exposure duration in LEO resulted in z22,800 thermal
cycles.[3] Pippin describes the base plate thermal cycling temperature range for MISSE 1 & 2 to be nominally
between +40 OC and —30 0C with occasional short—term excursions to more extreme temperatures. Preliminary data
from [3] also provided insight into the ionizing radiation enVironment on MISSE 1 & 2. Data from thermo—

Polymer experiment thin polymer ﬁlms. The TLD data indicated receiving approximately 26 krads(Si) through
0.005 cm aluminum for MISSE 2.[3] The average atomic oxygen ﬂuence for the MISSE 2 PEACE Polymers
experiment was determined to be 8.43 X 1021 atoms/crnZ, based on two Kapton H witness samples ﬂown as part of
the experiment.[l,2]
Black light inspection of the trays showed minimal to no contamination on the MISSE surfaces.[3] Results of X—ray
photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) contamination analysis of two MISSE 2 sapphire witness samples in tray E6
(located next to tray E5) indicated an extremely thin silica contaminant layer (1.3 and 1.4 nm on each slide,
respectively).[4] A small amount of ﬂuorine was also detected.[4] The MISSE 2 environment was found to be an
unusually clean environment with very low spacecraft induced molecular contamination. This is due to low
outgassing of other MISSE 2 tray 1 materials and also due to the position of MISSE 2 on 188.
3. MISSE 2 PEACE POLYMERS EXPERIMENT
The MISSE 2 PEACE Polymers resided in sample tray E5, which holds a total of 46 l""—diarneter ﬂight samples. The
PEACE Polymer samples start in the top row, 6th sample position from the left (i.e. ABS, with serial number 2—E5—
6, represents a sample in MISSE PEC 2, tray E5, sample position 6). Five other samples (four DC 93—500 silicone
samples and one AO scattering chamber) were also on this tray, in positions 2—E5—l through 2—E5—5. Sample
positions were chosen based on their anticipated erosion yields or by grouping samples by polymer family (such as
polyirnides). High erosion yield samples were located next to the silicone samples as the high erosion yield samples
are less likely to be affected by silicone cross—contarnination. Depending on the polymer thickness and estimated
erosion yields for each polymer, stacking of several sample layers was often necessary. The total number of layers
stacked for ﬂight was decided based on the thickness needed to survive a 3—year mission (3 times the duration of the
original planned mission).[l,2] Figure 2 shows pre—ﬂight and post—ﬂight photos of the MISSE 2 PEACE Polymers
experiment.

4. OPTICAL AND ELECTRON MICROSCOPY
An Olympus SZH stereo—zoorn microscope operated with a Canon EOS D30 digital camera was used to document
various features at magniﬁcations on the order of 10 to 100><. Scanning electron microscope images were obtained
using Hitachi S—4700 ﬁeld emission scanning electron microscopes (FESEM) operated at an accelerating voltage
from 2—15 kV, but typically at 6 kV. Energy dispersive spectroscopy (EDS) was conducted using either EDAX
CDU Leap Detector or IXRF Detector systems. All samples, except pyrolytic graphite, were sputter—coated with thin
gold—palladiurn (Au—Pd) ﬁlms to make them conductive for imaging.

The MISSE 2 PEACE ﬂight samples that were analyzed included: polyirnide Kapton H (2—E5—30) ﬂown as an

atomic oxygen ﬂuence witness sample, polyvinyl ﬂuoride (PVF) also known as clear Tedlar (2—E5—10), crystalline

PVF w/white pigment also known as white Tedlar (2—E5—1 1), pyrolytic graphite (PG) (2—E5—25),

chlorotriﬂuoroethylene (CTFE) also known as Kel—F (2—E5—39), ﬂuorinated ethylene propylene (FEP) also known

as Teﬂon FEP (2—E5—42), polytetraﬂuoroethylene (PTFE) also known as Teﬂon PTFE (2—E5—43), and
perﬂuoroalkoxy copolymer resin (PFA) also known as Teﬂon PFA (2—E5—44). In addition, alurninized—Teﬂon FEP

(Al—FEP) from MISSE 2 sample tray E6, ﬂown adjacent to E5, was also examined. Results for the individual

samples are provided below.

5.1 Polyimide Kagton H

One of two Kapton H witness samples that was ﬂown consisted of a stack of three layers of Kapton H ﬁlms each

being 5 mil (127 pm) thick. Post—ﬂight inspection found: the top layer to be completely eroded away (leaving a ring

in the protected experiment tray holder area); the second layer was very diffuse, gossamer thin, and eroded at an
edge; and, the third layer was textured. Figure 3 includes a post—ﬂight photograph of the ﬂight sarnple individual
layers, next to a control sample. Also included in the ﬁgure is a photo of the sample in tray E5 and information
about sectioning of the sample for FESEM imaging.

along with a close—up image of an impact site (upper left), a photo of the ﬂight and control sample layers (3
layers each 0.0127 cm thick) (right side), and information on sections of the various layers for FESEM
examination (lower left).

The fact that the second layer was still intact, and yet the third layer appeared to be textured was interesting, and

indicates that for thin ﬁlm polymers the underlying layers may be susceptible to atomic oxygen erosion even when

there is a layer above it. Because directed ram atornic oxygen erosion typically causes cone rnorphologies to
develop in materials with gaseous oxidation products, it was hypothesized that the second layer had holes at “cone
valleys” and that the third layer was exposed to atomic oxygen arrival at the locations of the holes in the layer above

(in this case, the second layer).[5] A Visual example of this is shown in the diagram in Figure 4.[5]

samples. [5]

To determine if this was true, samples were sectioned from the second and third layers and examined with FESEM.

Three samples were examined, as shown in Figure 3: a section of the second layer mounted with the space—exposed

surface up (to examine the cone texture), a section of second layer mounted with the backside up (to 100k for holes

at cone valleys), and a section of the third layer mounted with the space—exposed surface up (to examine the texture
that developed “below the hole”).

FESEM imaging revealed that the diffuse, space—exposed, second layer of Kapton H contained well developed cone

structures, as had been expected. Examples are provided for low (200 X) and higher (lkX) magniﬁcation in Figure

5. A couple other observations were made; the ﬁrst was that when examined at low magniﬁcation, the surface had

an overall aniness to it, as shown in Figure 5a. This will be discussed below. The second observation was that the

tops of the cones contained a substantial amount of ﬁne debris, or ash, as shown in Figure 5b. Backscattered
electron (BSE) images, which show higher density elements to be brighter than lower density elements, were
obtained. An example of a BSE image is provided in Figure 6, where the sample was imaged at a 00 tilt angle. In

this image higher density elements are present on the tips of the cones. This high density ash protects the Kapton H

from erosion, and it is believed that the ash content plays a signiﬁcant role in the erosion morphology development.

"6","The delicate looking cone tip debris was analyzed with EDS at an accelerating voltage of 15 kV to determine the
composition of the protective ash. The results are provided in Figures 7. Figure 7a is the spectrum obtained at the
top of a cone shown in the BSE image in 7b (location EDS—B), where the protective ash is not present; hence it is the
composition of the cone itself. The composition is primarily C and O, as expected for Kapton H polyirnide, and the
conductive ﬁlm elements are also present. Figure 7b is the spectrum obtained with the beam concentrated on ash, at
location EDS—C. In addition to C, 0, Au and Pd the ash is composed of Si and Zn, and possibly very small amounts
of Fe and Cu. Figure 70 provides a close—up BSE image of the ash on top of a cone. The corresponding spectrum is
for the bright spot identiﬁed as EDS—D. This bright particle within the ash has strong Zn and Si peaks, along with
Al peaks.

Images of the back—side 0f the second layer of the Kapton H ﬂight sample are shown in Figures 8 and 9. As
predicted, holes were present in the Kapton H layer at cone valleys. These holes are easily seen in all the images.
The holes appear to be circular in shape, but become irregularly shaped when several holes are joined. This can be
seen in Figure 8b. When the density of the holes becomes high enough, the holes eventually join together and can
form “free” regions of cones, producing tiny cone clusters. One of these isolated cone clusters is shown in Figure 80
where it is lifting out of the back—surface plane and the cones are Visible. It should be noted that this Kapton H layer
was very fragile, and hence it is very likely that this cone section separated during handling and sample mounting.
The images shown in Figure 8a and 8b are from the center of the sample. Images were obtained near the protected
edge where the sample tray held the sample in place, to see if the density of holes was greater than in the center of
the sample. Figure 8d is an image taken near the edge. It was taken at the same magniﬁcation (lkX) as the image in
Figure 8a. It clearly shows that there is a higher density of holes, and hence greater erosion, at the protected edge
than in the center of the sample. This may be due to a higher concentration of atomic oxygen at the edge due to
6

"
"7","focusing by the sample holder. Greater erosion at the sample edge of the MISSE 2 PEACE Polymer samples was
observed Visually, and measured With proﬁlometry as reported in [5]. A loose cone range is also Visible in Figure
8b. Figure 9 illustrates more clearly that the holes are at the base of the erosion cones.

cone cluster (lkX, 45 0 tilt), and b). A crack in the ﬁlm Where the cone structure is Visible (lkX, 45 0 tilt).
Images of the space—eXposed third layer of Kapton H are shown in Figure 10. As can be seen, erosion has occurred
in this layer of Kapton, even though it was below a seemingly intact layer. The erosion appears as shallow rounded
valleys. The rounding of the valleys is probably due to the fact that the Kapton H layers had some gap between
them, Which allows the divergence and scattering of incoming atomic oxygen to produce less well deﬁned erosion.
Upon closer examination, very ﬁne erosion texture can be seen along the walls of the shallow valleys, as shown in
Figure 10b. If one compares the density of the valleys in Figure 10b With the density of holes in Figure 8a for the
second layer, it is apparent the hole density in layer two and the erosion valleys in layer three are similar. Verifying
that erosion has occurred in the third layer of Kapton H, below a seemingly intact second layer provides evidence
that one should not use recession depth measurements for erosion yield determination for thin ﬁlm polymers, Where
erosion has affected more than one layer.

Another interesting observation from examining this multilayer thin ﬁlm sample is that it was apparent that the

second layer eroded somewhat non—uniformly. As an example, one can see aniness in the overall surface of the

space—facing Kapton second layer, as shown in the low magniﬁcation image in Figure 11. This aniness is
attributed to non—uniform erosion of the ﬁrst layer, which became completely eroded away while in space. There
can be numerous factors that can increase, or decrease, non—uniform erosion such as protective particles, scattering
effects, non—uniformity of ﬁlm thickness, and gaps between thin ﬁlm layers (which can produce a smoothing effect).
As a side note, this image includes the impact area, shown in Figure 3 above.

5.2 Polyvinyl Fluoride gPVFg, Clear Tedlar

Polyvinyl ﬂuoride (PVF), also commonly known as Tedlar® was analyzed. The clear Tedlar ﬁlm (TTR108G3) was

1 mil (25.4 pm) thick and a total of 13 layers were stacked together for ﬂight. Post—ﬂight, the top 10 layers were
completely eroded away, the 11th layer was textured and eroded, particularly along the edge, and the bottom 2 layers

(layers 12 & 13) appeared to be slightly discolored. The MISSE 2 LEO erosion yield for PVF was determined to be

3.19 X 10'24 cm3/atom.[1,2] Figure 12 is a post—ﬂight photograph of the ﬂight sample individual layers, next to a

control sample. The top exposed layer is on the left side of the ﬁgure and the bottom layer is on the right. A piece

of the 11th layer was sectioned and examined with the FESEM.

Examination of the eroded, but intact llth layer of the Tedlar sample stack was very interesting. The ﬁrst

observation was that the sample layer was non—uniformly eroded or textured, as shown in Figure 13a. Large areas

were present with non—uniforrn texture. Upon closer examination, it became apparent that cone clusters from the

(prior) upper surface layers were present and either sitting protecting the underlying layer from erosion, or were

littered 0n the surface (possibly shifted during shuttle retrieval and handling). Figure 13b shows an example of a

single loose cone cluster, which likely came from the protected area seen in the upper left corner of the image.

Figure 130 shows an area littered with many loose cone clusters.

Fig 13. FESEM images of the 11thlayer of clear Tedlar: a). Low magniﬁcation image showing non—uniform erosion,
the bright area to the right is the protected area (100X, 0° tilt), b). Single loose cone cluster (4kX, 0° tilt),
and c). An area littered with many loose cone clusters (lkX, 0° tilt).

These cone clusters appear to develop as upper layers eventually become non—uniformly eroded. Eventually, the

non—uniforrn erosion can result in areas where loose cone clusters from the upper layer remain intact and protect the

area below it from eroding. This can be seen in Figures l4a—l4c. In Figure 14a, the mountain ranges with cone
cluster tops have lines horizontally through the center of each, similar to strata in real mountain ranges. This line is
actually the boundary between the 10th layer and the 11th layer. Hence, a section of the 10th layer is still sitting on
top of the 11th layer, protecting it. Two ﬂat top mountains (plateaus) are shown, these are areas where the cone
clusters from the 10th layer protected these regions during ﬂight, but are no longer present (probably shifted during
retrieval or handling). Figure 14b shows a shifted erosion peak, where the atomic oxygen erosion texture matches
nicely to the protected mesa below. Figure 140 shows a “mountain range” with the erosion peaks from layer 10 all
still intact, but the boundary between the 10th and 11th layer is Visible. Atomic oxygen erosion cone propagation in
multi—layered polymer ﬁlms can result in the generation of weakly attached free particles, that could result in
particulate contamination on—orbit (e.g. when exposed to plume impingement 0r MMOD impacts).

5.3 Crystalline Polyvinyl Fluoride (PVFL W/ White Pigment, White Tedlar

Crystalline Polyvinyl Fluoride (PVF) w/white pigment, also commonly known as white Tedlar, was ﬂown. The

white Tedlar ﬁlm was 1 mil (25.4 urn) thick, and a total of 13 layers were stacked together for ﬁght. Post—ﬂight,

surprisingly, all 13 layers were intact. The top layer appeared to be teXtured, or more accurately, appeared to have a

white powdery looking surface. Figure 15 is a post—ﬂight photo of the top ﬂight sarnple layer. The ﬂight sample

had an impact site in the top layer. The impact caused a very large area to be affected, as shown in Figure 15, where
the powdery teXture appears to have been “blown—off’ during the impact. The MISSE 2 LEO erosion yield white

Tedlar was determined to be only 1.01 X 10'25 crn3/at0rn.[1,2]

Fig 15. Photograph of the top layer of the white Tedlar ﬂight sample with a close—up image of the impact area. The
very small impact crater (z0.06 mm) is pointed to by the arrow.

Even though this sample was coated with a thin conductive Au—Pd ﬁlm, the sample charged eXcessively during

imaging, and good quality images were difﬁcult to obtain. Figure 16 shows one image, taken at a 39° tilt, which

shows that a very porous teXture develops with atomic 0Xygen eXposure. This porous teXture is the result of the
polymer being rniXed with an atomic 0Xygen durable pigment, titanium diOXide (TiOz). With atomic 0Xygen
eXposure, a ﬁne Ti02 powder was found to remain on the surface, as the surrounding polymer eroded away. In
space, under direct ram atomic 0Xygen eXposure, and with little disturbance (the eXception being small impacts), the

powder gradually forms an increasingly protective layer reducing the rate of erosion. Hence, white Tedlar has a

substantially lower erosion yield in space (1.01 X 10'25 crn3/at01n) than clear Tedlar (3.19 X 10'24 crn3/at01n).[1,2]

Interestingly, a study conducted by Stanibler, et al. found that the erosion yield of white Tedlar (relative to Kapton
H) in a RF plasma asher was an order of magnitude greater (3.7 X 10'24 cm3/atorn) than it was in space.[6] In the
asher, where the atomic oxygen arrival is isotropic and at thermal energy, the thermal energy atomic oxygen is
effective in eroding the Tedlar matrix due to that fact that a higher ﬂuence of atoms is needed to produce an
equivalent erosion in Kapton H (the witness) exposed to hyperthermal atomic oxygen in LEO. In LEO, the
incoming hyperthermal atomic oxygen has a much higher probability of reaction upon initial impact with polymers.
Upon scattering off non reactive pigment particles, the AO becomes thermally accommodated resulting in orders of
magnitude lower reaction probability for oxidizing the polymer under the protective particles. Hence, after
scattering and thermally accommodating in LEO, the energy is the same as in an asher, but the total ﬂuence differs
as the asher needs a higher ﬂuence to replicate the equivalent erosion in unprotected Kapton H in LEO. This causes
greater undercutting below the TiOz pigment particles for the same effective ﬂuence as in LEO ram exposure.
5.4 Pyrolytic Graphite gPGg
The only non—polymer ﬂown as part of the MISSE PEACE Polymers experiment was pyrolytic graphite (PG). The
PG was 80 mil (0.203 cm) thick, and therefore only 1 layer was ﬂown. The directed ram LEO atomic oxygen
exposure resulted in the development of a black velvet—looking texture, as shown in Figure 17. The MISSE 2 LEO
erosion yield for PG was determined to be 4.15 X 10'2_5 eni3/atoni.[1,2]

As expected, based on the very diffuse, black, surface appearance, the high ﬂuence LEO direct ram atomic oxygen
exposure resulted in a ﬁne microscopic high density cone texture, such as shown in Figure 18. The PG was found
to display some other interesting features. For example, when examining the sample at lower magniﬁcations, such
as at 250X shown in Figure 19a, there are “lines” or rills that appear to be more resistant to atomic oxygen erosion.
When examining the protected edge of the sample, such as shown in Figure 19b, it can be seen that these more
atomic oxygen resistant lines appear to correspond to the structures that may be grain boundaries. Perhaps
impurities reside at these boundaries which impact the erosion rate. Upon close inspection of the erosion cones, a
small amount of very ﬁne ash appears to be present on the tips of the cones, as shown in the images in Figure 20.

Because the PG was a single thick layer, it provided a good material to compare the erosion yield determined using
recession depth measurements with the erosion yield determined using mass loss measurements. Fortunately, a
good size protected butte, 0r plateau, where the protected material was no longer present was found, as shown in
Figure 21. To obtain the erosion (or recession) depth, one needs to measure from the top of the protected butte t0
the center of the erosion cones. Because it is not possible to see the bottom of the cones, the center of the cones
needed to be guessed at, and this can introduce error. Two recession depth measurements were obtained from the
butte at two locations: 24.66 pm and 25.19 pm. Hence, the average depth was determined to be 24.93 pm. Because
the image was obtained with the sample tilted at a 45° angle, the actual depth of erosion was equal to 24.93
pm/sin(45°), or 35.25 pm. After converting this to cm (0.003525 cm) and dividing by the atomic 0Xygen ﬂuence
(8.43 X 1021 atoms/crnz), the erosion yield of the PG based on recession depth was determined to be 4.18 X 10'25
CH13/at0m. This is in eXcellent agreement with the erosion yield determined by mass loss (4.15 X 10'25 Cin3/at0rn).

5.5 Chlorotriﬂuoroethylene (CTFEL, Kel—F 0r Neoﬂon
A chlorine containing ﬂuoropolymer was ﬂown, chlorotriﬂuoroethylene (CTFE), is also commonly known as Kel—
F. This particular ﬁlm was Neoﬂon M—300. The CTFE ﬁlm was 5 mil (127 pm) thick, and only 1 layer was ﬂown.
The directed ram LEO atomic oxygen texture changed the essentially clear ﬁlm into a hazy white material, as
shown in Figure 22. The MISSE 2 LEO erosion yield for CTFE was determined to be 8.31 X 10'25 cm3/at0m.[1,2]

The ﬁrst observation for this sample was that it was very brittle. It cracked when the sample was cut with scissors
to section a piece for FESEM examination. Upon FESEM examination, this sample, similar to the PG had a well
developed cone morphology. Although the cones were found to be larger than the PG, this was expected because
the erosion yield was twice as great as PG. With a quick comparison of the cone density shown in Figure 18a for
PG with the cone density for CTFE shown in Figure 23 a, both taken at the same (1kX) magniﬁcation, it appears that
there may be twice the number cones for PG than for CTFE. Another observation for the CTFE is that there
appears to be greater erosion at the edge where the sample holder held it in place for ﬂight, as shown in Figure 24,
which may be due to a high atomic oxygen ﬂux due to scattering off the chamfered sample holder edge. Also, the
CTFE cones have a bit of a melted look to them, as Visible in the higher magniﬁcation images shown in Figure 25.

The ﬁrst observation when examining the FEP with the FESEM was that there was a crack along the
protected/exposed border, as shown in Figure 29. The sample holder is chainfered in this area and can provided
additional reﬂected radiation. Perhaps the reﬂected solar radiation can increase the degree of embrittlement through
increased dose or heating effects. But, the most surprising observation was that there were no erosion cones on the
FEP. Silvered—Teﬂon FEP was ﬂown on the Long Duration Exposure Facility (LDEF), and the diffuse leading edge
surfaces had well developed erosion cones (see section 5.10 below). Figure 30 shows two images of the MISSE 2

protective debris. The only texture Visible in “non—debris areas” is the presence of very small bright bumps, as seen

at 20 kX in Figure 31b. Figure 31a shows a ZOkX image in the protected area, where the bright bumps are not
present. It should be noted that the electron beam caused surface cracking to occur when imaged at 10 kX or above.

An example is shown in Figure 3 10 which was imaged at SOkX.

EDS spectrums were obtained for both exposed and protected areas of FEP, to verify the chemistry and to look for

any thin ﬁlm of contamination, such as silicone contamination, which could affect the erosion process. The

spectrum for the protected area (imaged at lOkX) is showed in Figure 32, and the only elements present were C and

F1, as expected (along with the conductive coating elements: Au & Pd). The spectrum for the exposed area (imaged

at lOkX) is shown in Figure 33, and is essentially the same as for the protected material. There is no evidence of

16

"
"17","contamination. Because FEP is such a low erosion yield material, if contamination was occurring on—orbit, one
would eXpect it to be shown on FEP, as a high erosion yield material may shed the in—coming contaminant quicker
than it can accumulate. These EDS analyses are consistent with those reported in [3] and [4] 0n the cleanliness of
this ﬂight experiment on orbit.

spectrum shows no evidence of contamination.
When eXamining the protected edge of the sample (shown in Figure 34a), a protected butte was found as shown in
Figure 34b. Because the butte was close to the protected edge, as seen in Figure 34a, and appeared to be the full
erosion depth in height, it was used to compute the erosion yield based on recession depth. One recession depth
measurement was obtained, and was 13.08 pm, as shown in Figure 34b. Because the image was obtained with the
sample tilted at a 450 angle, the actual depth of erosion was equal to 13.08 pm/sin(450), or 18.50 pm. After
converting this to cm (0.00185 cm) and dividing by the atomic 0Xygen ﬂuence (8.43 X 1021 atoms/cmz), the erosion
yield of the FEP based on recession depth was determined to be 2.19 X 10'25 cm3/at0m. This is in good agreement
with the erosion yield determined by mass loss (2.00 X 10'25 cm3/at0m).

butte (500X, 45O tilt), and b). Close—up of protected butte and corresponding recession depth measurement:

13.08 pm (4kX, 45O tilt).
One other observation that is worth noting is that the butte shown in Figure 35 appears to have been protected
during ﬂight, but upon close inspection there is actually a very ﬁne texture on the surface. This indicates that the
protective particle was removed sometime during ﬂight and that erosion has occurred. If one compares the height
of this butte to the one in Figure 34b (taken at 4kX), it can be seen that the butte in Figure 35 (taken at 5kX) does
not have the same recession step—height. The lesson here is that care must be taken when using protected buttes for
recession depth measurements. It is important to be certain that it is a “full erosion depth” butte. The potential for
making an error by obtaining the recession depth from a partially eroded butte, is another reason why mass loss
measurements can be more advantageous: they average out the recession depth for the entire surface.

Another ﬂuoropolymer that was ﬂown was polytetraﬂuoroethylene (PTFE), also referred to as Teﬂon PTFE. This
particular ﬁlm was Chemﬁlm DF 100. The PTFE ﬁlm was 2 mil (50.8 pm) thick, and only 1 layer was ﬂown. The
directed ram LEO atomic oxygen appeared to cause only very slight texturing, and like the FEP this sample was
wavy as compared to the control sample, as shown in Figure 36. The MISSE 2 LEO erosion yield for PTFE was
determined to be 1.42 X 10'25 cm3/atom.[1,2]

"19","Upon macro examination, a large area of the protected/exposed edge of the sample had a large through—thickness
“split” in the material. It was not apparent if this split was due to excessive erosion or if it was embrittled (hence a
crack). The sample was sectioned carefully and mounted on a FESEM holder so that the protected/exposed edge
could be examined in the FESEM. Figure 37 shows a View of the edge, which was not eroded through and was
obviously embrittled with brittle fracture cracks.

Similar to the FEP, the MISSE 2 PEACE PTFE did not develop cones during erosion, except at locations of

protective debris, as shown in Figure 38. With a 00 tilt, the surface appears to have small bright bumps, again

similar to the FEP. At higher magniﬁcation, an interesting morphology is apparent along with the bumps, as shown
in Figure 39. This sample was found to contain large debris ﬁelds, as shown in Figure 40, with numerous protective
particles, such as shown in Figures 41a—4lc.

compute the erosion yield based on recession depth. Two recession depth measurements were obtained, 7.90 pm
and 8.81 pm, and the average was 8.36 pm. Because the image was obtained with the sample tilted at a 450 angle,

Perﬂuoroalkoxy copolymer resin (PFA), also referred to as Teﬂon PFA, was ﬂown. This particular ﬁlm was Teﬂon
PFA 200 CLP. The PFA ﬁlm was 2 mil (50.8 pm) thick, and 4 layers were stacked together for ﬂight. All four
layers were intact, as shown in Figure 43, and the directed ram LEO atomic oxygen appeared to cause only very
slight texturing of the top layer. The MISSE 2 LEO erosion yield for PFA was determined to be 1.73 X 10'25

Similar to the FEP and the PTFE, the MISSE 2 PFA did not develop cones during erosion, except at locations of
protective debris, as shown in Figures 44a—44c. Figure 44b is an image taken at 5 kX that shows erosion around a
protective particle, but with an otherwise smooth surface. Note that these features are leaning slightly in 44a. This
“non—perpendicular” tilt of erosion features was observed in most of the examined samples, and is attributed to the
fact that MISSE 2 was found to have been tilted with respect to the ram atomic oxygen, by approximately 8
degrees.[5] The image in 44b was scan rotated (electronically rotated) to eliminate this tilt. Figure 440, taken at
lOkX shows small bright bumps. With a 00 sample tilt, and high magniﬁcation, the surface appears to have bright
bumps, again similar to the FEP and PTFE. Figure 45 shows high magniﬁcation images of both protected and
exposed PFA. At very high magniﬁcation (SOkX), again, like the PTFE, an interesting morphology is apparent
along with the bumps, as shown in Figure 450. Although the sample was sensitive to the electron beam and cracked
at high magniﬁcation imaging. The FEP appeared to have a similar polymer texture as the PTFE and PFA at SOkX,
but because the FEP surface became easily damaged & cracked under high magniﬁcation imaging, it was difﬁcult
to tell if the observed features were induced or changed by the imaging electron beam.

(imaged at 10 kX) is shown in Figure 46, and was the same for a 2 kX analysis area. There is no evidence of
contamination. The only elements present are C, F and the conductive ﬁlm elements (Au & Pd). Again, because
PFA is a low erosion yield material, if contamination was occurring on—orbit, one would expect it to be shown on
the PFA.

5.9 Aluminized-FEP gAl-FEPL
Because the clear FEP sample did not show the presence of any cones, it was decided to examine another FEP
sample ﬂown on MISSE 2 tray 1. The FEP ﬁlm was 5 mil (127 pm) thick and was vapor deposited with z1000 A of
aluminum (VDA) on the back surface. Only 1 layer was ﬂown, with the FEP space—facing. This sample was ﬂown
as part of the Polymer Film Thermal Control (PFTC) and Gossamer Materials experiments, and resided in MISSE
PEC 2, tray 1, sample tray E6. Sample tray E6 was ﬂown adjacent to E5, and hence received essentially the same
LEO exposure as E5. The atomic oxygen ﬂuence for sample tray E6 was determined based on the mass loss of a
single Kapton H witness sample, ﬂown as part of the PFTC and Gossamer Materials experiments. The atomic
oxygen ﬂuence was determined to 8.51 X 1021 atoms/cm2.[4] This is in good agreement with the ﬂuence determined
for the PEACE Polymers experiment tray. The solar exposure for sample tray E5, near the aluminized sample, was
approximately 6,050 ESH.[3] The MISSE 2 LEO erosion yield for Al—FEP was determined to be 2.11 X 10'25
cm3/atom.[4] This ﬂuence is slightly higher than the ﬂuence determined for the clear FEP on tray E5, which was
2.00 X 10'25 cm3/atom.
When Viewed with a 00 tilt angle (looking straight down on the sample), the Al—FEP sample was found to have
bright bumps, similar to the FEP, as shown in Figure 47a. However, the bumps shown in the FEP samples (Figure
31b) are much smaller. At a 450 tilt, the Al—FEP was found to have very small erosion cones, as shown in Figure

22

"
"23","47b. Comparing this image to that taken at the same tilt angle and magniﬁcation for FEP in Fig 440 above, it
appears that the metallized Teﬂon has small cones, while the clear FEP does not. Once again, this sample was
examined with EDS, and the area shown in 47a, but imaged at 5kX, was found to only contain F, C, Au and Pd, as
shown in Figure 48. A protected area was also imaged and EDS analyzed, and the spectrum was nearly identical to
that of the exposed area.

Once again for this sample, a protected butte with a smooth top was found as shown in Figure 49 (imaged with scan
rotation of 11.4 degrees). The butte was used to compute the erosion yield based on recession depth. Two recession
depth measurements were obtained, 13.25 pm and 13.85 pm, and the average was 13.55 pm. Because the image
was obtained with the sample tilted at a 450 angle, the actual depth of erosion was equal to 13.55 pm/sin (450), or
19.16 pm which indicates an erosion yield of the Al—FEP based on recession depth of 2.25 X 10'25 cm3/at0m. This is
in good agreement with the erosion yield determined by mass loss (2.11 X 10'25 cm3/at0m).

"24","As mentioned, although eroded, the MISSE 2 clear FEP did not develop erosion cones, while the MISSE 2 Al—FEP
did develop small cones, and the erosion yield for the Al—FEP (2.11 X 10'25 ern3/atoni) was found to be slightly
greater than clear FEP (2.00 X 10'25 cm3/atorn), based on mass loss measurements. It is hypothesized that metallized

FEP may have a slightly higher erosion rate and shows slight development of cones, as compared with clear FEP,

because as a second surface reﬂector the solar radiation can reﬂect off the metal coating and travel back though the

FEP layer increasing both radiation and heating effects. Clear FEP and Al—FEP were tested together in an energetic

end Hall atomic OXygen beam system which impinges a predominantly 02+ beam at 70 eV onto samples. Using this

system, the Al—FEP was found to have an erosion yield that was 15% greater than the clear FEP. Further analyses of
the teXture of these samples needs to be conducted.

5.10 LDEF Ag-FEP vs. MISSE clear FEP and MISSE Al— FEP

As mentioned previously, Ag—FEP on the leading edge of LDEF was found to be hazy and had developed a ram

atomic OXygen cone teXture as it eroded. Images of Ag—FEP from LDEF tray E10 (from row 10, which was neXt to

the direct ram facing surface (row 9)) are shown in Figures 50a—500. For comparison, images of MISSE 2 Al—FEP
taken at the same magniﬁcations are shown in Figures 51a—5lc. The erosion yield for LDEF Ag—FEP (average for
rows 7, 8, 10 and 11; based on mass comparison of ﬂight and control samples) was 3.4 i 1.3 X 10'25 eni3/atoni.[7]

LDEF row 10 (E10) was eXposed to the same atomic 0Xygen ﬂuence, 8.43 X 1021 atoms/crnz, as the MISSE 2 FEP

on E5, and essentially the same ﬂuence as the MISSE 2 Al—FEP on E6 (8.51 X 1021 atoms/cniz).[7] But, the LDEF

Ag—FEP was eXposed to a higher solar eXposure than the MISSE Teﬂon samples. LDEF row 10 received 10,700

ESH [7], while the MISSE E5 tray received z6,300 ESH and E6 received z6,050 ESH.

In summary, LDEF Ag—FEP (E10) had signiﬁcantly more erosion (Ey = 3.4 X 10'25 om3/atom) and substantially
greater developed texture (larger cones) than MISSE Al—FEP (Ey = 2.11 X 10'25 cm3/atom), or MISSE clear FEP (Ey
= 2.00 X 10'25 cm3/atom), with similar atomic oxygen ﬂuence exposure. It is hypothesized that this may be
primarily due to the difference in solar exposure between the two missions:

- MISSE FEP: 8.43 x 1021 atom/cmz & 6,300 ESH (Ey = 2.00 x 10'25 cm3/atom)

- MISSE Al-FEP: 8.51 x 1021 atom/cmz & 6,050 ESH (Ey = 2.11 x 10'25 cm3/atom)

- LDEF Ag-FEP: 8.43 x 1021 atom/cm2 & 10,700 ESH (Ey = 3.4 x 10'25 cm3/atom)

Interestingly, the LDEF FEP had 1.7 times the erosion yield of MISSE Clear FEP (1.6 times the erosion yield for Al—
FEP) and the LDEF FEP had 1.7 times the solar exposure as MISSE clear FEP (1.8 times the erosion yield for Al—
FEP). It should be noted that heating is believed to also play a role in erosion. A thermocouple on MISSE 2 tray 1
measured an on—orbit temperature range of —44.70C to + 31.60C [3], while the structure of LDEF for row 9 (next to
row 10) has been calculated to have been +120C to +380 C during ﬂight.[8] Therefore, it appears that the average
temperature of LDEF was higher (25 0C) than MISSE 2 (—70 C). In addition, the average number of suns for the
LDEF Mission on row 10 (10,700 ESH/50,568 mission hours = 0.212) was 16% higher than for the MISSE 2 E5
tray (6,300 ESH/34,680 mission hours = 0.182). Also, the beginning of life absorptance to emittance ratios (LDEF
Ag—FEP = 0.10, MISSE Al—FEP = 0.12, and MISSE clear FEP possibly = 0002—0003) indicate that Ag—FEP would
run cooler than Al—FEP, but hotter than clear FEP.[9] Certainly the temperature differences could help explain the
different in texture between the MISSE Al—FEP (hotter) and non—aluminized MISSE FEP (cooler). Therefore, the
effect of the metallization may contribute to the presence of texture due to increased temperature and also possibly
increased radiation exposure. Both radiation effects, and temperature effects, on the presence or absence of texture
deserve further investigation.

6. SUMMARY & CONCLUSIONS

The MISSE 2 PEACE Polymers experiment is unique because it has the widest variety of polymers ﬂown
collectively in LEO for a long duration (3.95 years), and was exposed to an unusually clean LEO spacecraft
environment. Examination of numerous MISSE 2 PEACE Polymer experiment ﬂight samples, after high ﬂuence
LEO ram atomic oxygen exposure, by FESEM and EDS was found to provide a wealth of knowledge on the
degradation of thin ﬁlm polymers in the LEO space environment. These ﬁndings include the following:

o EDS analyses conﬁrmed the prior conclusion that the MISSE 2 ﬂight experiment was exposed to a very
clean space exposure environment, as no sources of contamination, such as silicone, were observed.
Therefore, the By data reported for the MISSE 2 PEACE Polymers was not affected by contamination,
unlike numerous other ﬂight experiments.

0 Erosion can occur in underlying materials below thin ﬁlm polymers, even when the thin ﬁlm is still
structurally intact. This was veriﬁed by examining Kapton H and documenting both holes at “cone—
valleys” and erosion texture in an underlying Kapton layer at the corresponding hole locations. Therefore,
a spacecraft may have damage to underlying layers on—orbit, even if the By predicts that the “outer layer”
will be intact.

25

"
"26","0 Atomic oxygen erosion cone propagation in multi-layered polymer ﬁlms can result in the generation of
weakly attached free particles, that could result in particulate contamination on-orbit (e.g. when exposed to
plume impingement, MMOD impacts, etc.).

o FESEM analyses conﬁrmed the prior conclusion that mass loss was the best technique for obtaining the By
of the MISSE 2 PEACE Polymers. Hence, mass loss is the recommended technique for By determination
of stacked thin ﬁlm polymers where the erosion can extend beyond the top layer.

0 Non-volatile oxide ash debris is present on the tops of the cones of many samples. This ash helps protect
the underlying material from erosion, and is believed to play a signiﬁcant role in the erosion morphology
development. Future studies of the effect of ash content on erosion morphology are desired.

0 Care should be used when looking for protected buttes for recession depth measurement, as often, buttes
may be present, but are not the full erosion depth in height. The lesson learned is that one needs to be
careful to use a full height butte for recession depth measurements.

0 White Tedlar was found to develop a ﬁne loose powdery surface, which under directed ram atomic oxygen
exposure in LEO provided protection to the underlying material from atomic oxygen erosion.

0 Grain boundaries of PG were found to be more atomic oxygen durable than the grain matrix.

0 Samples with erosion occurring only in the top (or a single ﬂown) layer, such as pyrolytic graphite, Teﬂon
FEP and PTFE were used to determine the By based on recession depth measurements. The results were in
excellent agreement with the MISSE 2 PEACE Polymers Ey data obtained based on mass loss.

0 Fluoropolymers, such as PTFE and FEP, showed eVidence of embrittlement through crack development
near the chamfered protected edge. Hence, reﬂected solar radiation may increase the degree of radiation
induced embrittlement through increased radiation dose and/or increased temperature.

0 Although eroded, surprisingly, clear FEP did not develop a cone texture. Yet, Al-FEP from MISSE 2 tray
E6 (ﬂown next to E5) was examined, and was found to contain very small cones, which may be attributed
to greater heating (greater oc/e) and/or radiation exposure (reﬂected radiation) of the metallized FEP.

0 Clear FEP and Al-FEP were tested in an end Hall atomic oxygen beam and the metallized FEP was found
to have a slightly higher erosion yield (15%) than the clear FEP. An analysis of the texture of these
samples still needs to be conducted.

0 When comparing the results of FEP ﬂown on MISSE with those from LDEF, it was found that LDEF Ag-
FEP (E10) had signiﬁcantly more erosion and substantially more developed texture (larger cones) than
either MISSE Al-FEP or MISSE clear FEP with very similar atomic oxygen ﬂuence exposures. The solar
exposure may have contributed in two ways: ﬁrst, LDEF had a greater total dose of radiation (LDEF FEP
had l.6-l.7X ESH as the MISSE FEP), and, second, the average structure temperature and the number of
average suns was greater for LDEF than MISSE 2, possibly contributing to increased temperatures of the
samples.

Studies should be continued to examine the remaining MISSE 2 PEACE Polymer samples, as valuable knowledge
can be gained from examining each sample. Also, it would be of interest to conduct a study where the ash content
of each polymer is compared with the cone density and erosion yield, to see if there is a correlation between ash
content and erosion morphology. Lastly, separate temperature and radiation effects on atomic oxygen surface
texture would also be of value to investigate, because of the surprising lack of texture for the MISSE 2 clear FEP
Teﬂon, and the different in erosion yields between the LDEF and MISSE FEP for similar atomic oxygen ﬂuences.
