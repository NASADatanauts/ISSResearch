Abstract. During the ﬁrst days of spaceﬂight, about 50—70% of the astronauts experience symptoms of Space Motion Sickness
(SMS). It has been proposed that an asymmetry between the left and right otolith organs contributes to an astronaut’s individual
susceptibility. A recently developed test to measure unilateral utricular function enabled us to re-investigate this so-called otolith
asymmetry hypothesis, while using the paradigm of sustained centrifugation as a ground based model for SMS. This latter
paradigm has been shown to elicit symptoms similar to those of SMS and is referred to as Sickness Induced by Centrifugation
(SIC). In 15 healthy subjects unilateral utricular function was assessed by recording ocular counter rolling during a unilateral
centrifugation paradigm. In addition, saccular function was assessed by recording Vestibular Evoked Myogenic Potentials
(VEMPs), and horizontal semicircular canal function was assessed using bithermal caloric stimulation. SIC-susceptible subjects
showed a marginally higher degree of utricular asymmetry, utricular sensitivity and semicircular canal sensitivity 09 < 0.1) than
the non-susceptible group. Interestingly, a logistic regression model using both utricular and semicircular canal parameters led
to a correct classiﬁcation of 91% of the subjects. As such, these results suggest that otolith asymmetry is at most one factor — and
not present in all susceptible subjects — in deﬁning susceptibility to SMS and SIC. Both the utricular and the canal system might
be involved as well.
