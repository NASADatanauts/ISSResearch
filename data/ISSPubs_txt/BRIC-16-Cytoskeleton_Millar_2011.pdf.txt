An Endogenous Growth Pattern of Roots Is Revealed
In Seedlings Grown In MicrograVIty
Katherine D.L. Millar,* Christina M. Johnson,* Richard E. Edelmann, and John Z. Kiss
Abstract
In plants, sensitive and selective mechanisms have evolved to perceive and respond to light and gravity. We
investigated the effects of microgravity on the growth and development of Arabidopsis thaliana (ecotype
Landsberg) in a spaceﬂight experiment. These studies were performed with the Biological Research in Canisters
(BRIC) hardware system in the middeck region of the space shuttle during mission STS-131 in April 2010.
Seedlings were grown on nutrient agar in Petri dishes in BRIC hardware under dark conditions and then fixed in
ﬂight with paraformaldehyde, glutaraldehyde, or RNAlater. Although the long-term objective was to study the
role of the actin cytoskeleton in gravity perception, in this article we focus on the analysis of morphology of
seedlings that developed in microgravity. While previous spaceﬂight studies noted deleterious morphological
effects due to the accumulation of ethylene gas, no such effects were observed in seedlings grown with the BRIC
system. Seed germination was 89% in the spaceﬂight experiment and 91% in the ground control, and seedlings
grew equally well in both conditions. However, roots of space-grown seedlings exhibited a significant difference
(compared to the ground controls) in overall growth patterns in that they skewed to one direction. In addition, a
greater number of adventitious roots formed from the axis of the hypocotyls in the ﬂight-grown plants. Our
hypothesis is that an endogenous response in plants causes the roots to skew and that this default growth
response is largely masked by the normal 1g conditions on Earth. Key Words: Gravity—Multicellular life—
