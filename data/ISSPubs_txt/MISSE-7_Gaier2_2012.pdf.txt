Abstract

SiX samples of pristine and dust-abraded outer layer spacesuit fabrics were included in the Materials
International Space Station Experiment-7, in which they were exposed to the wake-side low Earth orbit
environment on the International Space Station (188) for 18 months in order to determine whether
abrasion by lunar dust increases radiation degradation. The fabric samples were characterized using
optical microscopy, optical spectroscopy, ﬁeld emission seaming electron microscopy, atomic force
microscopy, and tensile testing before and after exposure on the ISS. Comparison of pre- and post-ﬁight
characterizations showed that the environment darkened and reddened all siX fabrics, increasing their
integrated solar absorptance by 7 to 38 percent. There was a decrease in the ultimate tensile strength and
elongation to failure of lunar dust abraded Apollo spacesuit ﬁbers by a factor of four and an increase in
the elastic modulus by a factor of two.

"6","1.0 Introduction

During the Apollo missions, lunar dust was more problematic than anticipated. Post-mission
documents reveal that there were difﬁculties with contaminated surfaces, clogged mechanisms,
compromised seals, confusion of navigation equipment, degrading of radiators, irritation of eyes and
lungs, and the abrasion of surfaces, including the spacesuits (Ref. 1). The Apollo spacesuits were exposed
to the lunar surface environment for less than 24 hr, but even in this short period of time the suits showed
appreciable wear. Apollo 12 astronaut Pete Conrad remarked, “We must have had more than a hundred
hours suited work with the same equipment, and the wear was not as bad on the training suits as it is on
these ﬂight suits in just the eight hours we were out. ” (Ref. 2). For example, Figure 1 shows a hole
abraded through the outer layer of Harrison Schmitt’s Apollo 17 suit above the boot. If long term
missions to the Moon or other extraterrestrial surfaces are going to be undertaken, the mechanisms of this
degradation must be understood and mitigated.

The outer layer of the Apollo-era pressure garment assembly (PGA) is made from ﬂuorinated ethylene
propylene (FEP) and modern space suit PGAs from the closely related polytetraﬂuoroethylene (PTFE).
FEP was also used as a thermal control material on the Hubble Space Telescope (HST). This was found to
degrade with severe cracking after 6.8 yr exposure to the space environment (Ref. 3). The primary cause
of the degradation is thought to have been polymer chain scission by particle and electromagnetic (EM)
radiation combined with thermal cycling. Heating the shorter polymer chains facilitated crystallization,
resulting in a far more brittle material (Refs. 3 and 4). Because the extinction coefﬁcient for high energy
UV radiation is so large, it is absorbed primarily the surface of a material. Since dust abrasion increases
the surface area of a material, there is concern that abrasion may increase radiation degradation.

The International Space Station (188) is a laboratory orbiting about 350 km (280 to 460 km) above the
surface of the Earth, traveling at a speed of about 28,000 km/hr. It is a j oint proj ect among the space
agencies of the United States (NASA), Russia (RKA), J apan (JAXA), Canada (CSA) and 11 European
countries (BSA). The 188 has been continuously staffed since November 2, 2000. Astronauts and
cosmonauts from 16 countries have worked on it, and it has been Visited by ﬁve space tourists.

Although most of the experimentation that has been conducted aboard the 188 has occurred inside the
pressurized compartments, some researchers have taken advantage of its unique position to study the
space environment from outside. The Materials International Space Station Experiment (MISSE) is a
series of experiments mounted externally on the 188 that investigate the effects of long-term exposure of

experiment packages called Passive Experiment Containers (PECs) that are mounted with half of the
exposure surface facing the direction of motion of 188 through the exosphere (ram direction) and half the
other side (wake direction), or alternately with one surface facing away from the Earth (zenith) and the
opposite facing towards the Earth (nadir).

The concern about the synergistic effects of abrasion and radiation damage prompted the inclusion of
the Spacesuit Fabrics Exposure Experiment on the Materials International Space Station Experiment-7
(MISSE-7). In this experiment, pristine and dust-abraded samples of outer layer spacesuit fabrics were
ﬂown on the wake side PEC for approximately 18 months, from November 2009 to May 2011. They were
exposed to the space radiation environment of LEO, which is similar to that of the Moon, though reduced
in particle radiation because many of the solar wind ions are captured by the van Allen radiation belts,
well above 188 orbit. The long-term exposure in LEO shed light on the extent to which spacesuit fabrics
degraded in long-term exposure on the Moon, and how dust abrasion affects it. Unintended exposure to
atomic oxygen (A0) during the reorientation of the ISS introduced an additional degradation mechanism.

The Spacesuit Fabric Exposure Experiment was assembled at the NASA Glenn Research Center and
integrated into the wake side of PEC-7B at the NASA Langley Research Center. It was launched from the
NASA Kennedy Space Center aboard the Space Shuttle Atlantis (STS-129) on November 16, 2009. On
November 23, astronaut Randolph Bresnik removed MISSE-7 from the cargo bay and installed it on
ELC-2, located on the S3 Truss segment. Figure 2 shows MISSE-7 as mounted on the ISS.

Figure 3.—The Spacesuit Fabric Exposure Experiment after recovery in the lab, before being removed from
MISSE-7, showing in its local flight environment.

After 554 days in orbit, on May 20, 2011, astronauts Drew Feustel and Greg Chamitoff retrieved
MISSE-7 and mounted it into the payload bay of Space Shuttle Endeavor. This was STS-134, the 25th and
ﬁnal ﬂight of Endeavor, which returned MISSE-7 to Earth on June 1. MISSE-7 was transferred to the
NASA Langley Research Center, and on July 12 the experiment was ﬁrst recovered and photographed
(Figure 3). De-integration occurred on July 21 and the experiment was returned to the NASA Glenn
Research Center on July 26. Analysis was started almost immediately, in case reactions with air or
laboratory humidity would induce further changes. No Visual evidence of any such changes was observed.
All analyses were completed by mid-December 2011.

The preparation and pre-ﬂight characterization of the fabric samples have been described previously
(Ref. 5), as has the post-ﬂight characterization (Ref. 6). A summary of the changes in the fabrics after
18 months of space exposure is the focus of this study.

2.0 Methods and Materials
2.1 Materials

The MISSE-7 Spacesuit Fabrics Exposure Experiment consists of siX samples of spacesuit fabric.
During the Apollo program, the outer surface of the PGA was made of woven FEP fabric. Although most
of the PGAs were made with a plain-weave FEP, in some cases atwi11-weave FEP was used. Three of the
samples were of twill weave FEP. One was mounted as received (pristine), and a second was abraded

"9","with J SC-lA lunar simulant, as described below. A small piece from the left knee region of the PGA
worn on the lunar surface for 7.8 hr by Alan Bean during Apollo 12, which was a twill weave, was
obtained and included in this experiment as well. This was one of the most heaVily soiled portions of the
Bean PGA. The samples were about 1 cm square, which was not small compared to the measurement area
for photography, microscopic imaging, energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy, or total reﬂectance
spectroscopy. While the gauge length was smaller than typical for tensile testing, the aspect ratio of the
ﬁlaments was sufﬁciently high, and the standard deviation was not atypical for these sorts of tests.

PGA design has progressed since the Apollo era, and the suits worn by astronauts in their return to the
Moon will probably not have an outer layer of woven FEP. The current PGAs used in Space Shuttle and
International Space Station EVAs use Ortho-fabric (Fabric Development) as the outermost layer. Ortho-
fabric is a two layer plain weave face tied to back of 400 denier GorteX (W.L. Gore & Associates), 200
denier NomeX (DuPont) and 400 denier Kevlar (DuPont). The yarn count is 51x41 on the face, and 39x33
on the back. The fabric weight is 15.0 oz/yd2 (0.355 kg/mz), with a thickness of 0.027 in (0.69 mm)

(Ref. 7). The outer GorteX layer of is made from expanded PTFE, so although the two fabric types are
very different, they both have ﬂuorinated hydrocarbons as the outermost material. Three samples of
Ortho-fabric were ﬂown as part of the MISSE-7 Spacesuit Fabrics Exposure Experiment as well, with one
being pristine, a second abraded with J SC-lA to the same level as the FEP, and the third being abraded
with J SC-lA for twice as long.

2.2 Dust Abrasion

A Dust Abrasion of EVA Fabric Protocol was developed as a standardized set of procedures by which
to abrade PGA fabrics for the MISSE-7 experiment (Ref. 8). The goal was to reproduce damage seen on
Alan Bean’s Apollo 12 suit. An ASTM standard test (Ref. 9) was modiﬁed so that damage was inﬂicted
on small patches of fabric using loose lunar dust simulant, rather than an abrasion wheel. A photograph of
the abrasion apparatus in shown in Figure 4. The fabric was mounted on the horizontal wheel and covered
with a thin layer of J SC-lA lunar simulant which was plasma activated in the Lunar Dust Adhesion Bell
J ar at the NASA Glenn Research Center, a high ﬁdelity lunar environment simulation chamber. Without
breaking vacuum, the wheel was rotated at 70 rpm. As it spins, it also spins the two vertically mounted
abrasion wheels. These are slightly offset from the horizontal rotation aXis so that one scuffs in and the
other scuffs out. One sample of PEP fabric and one sample of Ortho-fabric were thus abraded for 8000
cycles. A second Ortho-fabric sample was abraded for 16,000 cycles, and will be referred to as the 2x
abraded sample. The protocol is detailed in the pre-ﬂight report (Ref. 5).

"
"10","2.3 Photography and Microscopy

To the extent possible, pre-ﬂight and post-ﬂight analyses were done using the same protocols, and
these are also detailed in the pre-ﬂight report (Ref. 5). Survey photos, such as that shown in F igure 3,
were taken of the samples in the sample holder to record the orientation and local environment of each
sample in the ﬂight conﬁguration. Imaging included optical microscopy at magniﬁcations of 7.1x, 10x,
25x, 50><, and 100x; F ield Emission Scanning Electron Microscopy (FESEM) at 50x, 100x, 250x, 1000><,
and 4000>< and Atomic F orce Microscopy (AFM) with scanning ﬁelds of 60pm, 10 um, I um, and 100
nm. The one aspect that was different between the pre-ﬂight and post-ﬂight analyses was the sampling
areas. Whereas one of the goals of the pre-ﬂight characterization was to establish the baseline structure, in
the post-ﬂight analysis changes and anomalies were the target. For example, in the F ESEM ﬁve regions
were surveyed pre-ﬂight, but only two maj or regions of the post-ﬂight, one that was eXposed and one that
was shielded by the sample holder. Within those regions images were taken that were representative of
the whole, and of areas of anomalous wear.

In addition to survey photos taken of the entire sample holder, post-ﬂight photographs were taken
with the samples illuminated by a UV lamp. F luorescence under UV illumination can indicate the
presence of contamination or sample degradation. Energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS) was also
used post-ﬂight to examine the samples for contamination. This was done in conjunction with the F ESEM
such that the elemental composition of speciﬁc microscopic areas of the samples could be determined.
2.4 Total Reﬂectance Spectroscopy

Optical spectroscopy was performed on the fabrics to look for signs of degradation. Of particular
concern was whether the thermal properties, primarily the integrated solar absorptance, 0t, would increase
as this would impose an additional heat load on the suit. Total reﬂectivity (p00), was measured with a
Cary 5000 (Varian) spectrophotometer equipped with an integrating sphere over wavelengths (7») from
250 to 2500 nm in increments of 1 nm, at a scan rate of 600 nm/min. A deuterium lamp was used to
illuminate the samples to measure the 250 to 350 nm data, and a halogen lamp to illuminate the samples
to measure the 350 to 2500 nm data. Immediately prior to measuring each sample, a spectrum of the
Spectralon was collected as a sample, to determine whether the baseline was still valid. In all instances
the deViations in the baseline were less than 1 percent. The integrated solar cc of each sample was
determined from the convolution of the scaled p(?t) with the ASTM air mass zero solar spectral irradiance
table E—490—00 and expressed as a fraction of the solar spectrum.

2.5 Mechanical Properties

Individual ﬁlaments from the Alan Bean sample were tensile tested to measure the ultimate tensile
strength, elongation, and Young's modulus of ﬁbers. Pre- and post-ﬂight values were compared to
measure mechanical degradation. Only the Alan Bean ﬁbers were tested because the F EP fabric used for
the pristine and abraded F EP samples was constructed of thicker ﬁbers (on the order of 300 um in
diameter as opposed to an average 23 um for the Bean ﬁbers) as was the Ortho-fabric outer layer PTF E
ﬁbers (on the order of 500 um in diameter). The protocol described below was not effective for these
thicker ﬁbers because they would slip out of the adhesive before breaking. F uture testing should include
developing a method to tensile test these thicker ﬁbers.

The ASTM Standard Test Method for Tensile Strength and Young’s Modulus of F ibers was used to
develop the tensile test protocol (Ref. 10), each ﬁber was ﬁrst mounted on a 5 3- by l5-mm tab cut from
an indeX card using the Reltek Teﬂon Bonding Kit procedure (Reltek, LLC). A 1/8 in. (3.1 mm) diameter
hole punch was used to punch three holes in the center of the tab, as shown in F igure 5. After the tab is
mounted in the instrument, the indeX card was out along the dotted line such that only the ﬁber connects
the two ends of the tab.

Figure 5.—Geometry of the tabs the fibers mounted with adhesive (shown
as grey circles) for the tensile test. After mounting the tab in the tensile
tester, the tab was cut along the dotted line so that the resulting halves
were connected only by the fiber.

The tensile tester was set to a start threshold of 0.01 N, end test of 266 s, and log rate of 30.10 Hz. The
pre-ﬂight Bean ﬁbers were pulled at a test rate of 203.2 mm/min. The post-ﬂight ﬁbers were pulled at a
test rate of 12.7 mm/min because they were more brittle so at higher test rates they would break before the
tensile tester could register any data. The tensile test data and the average pre-ﬂight and post-ﬂight ﬁber
diameters (obtained from FESEM photomicrographs by averaging the diameter in 10 positions on four
ﬁbers in each category) were used to calculate the ultimate tensile strength, elongation at failure, and
Young's modulus for each ﬁber. The mean and standard deviation of each value was calculated for pre-
ﬂight and post-ﬂight ﬁbers.

3.0 Results and Discussion
3.1 Survey Photography

Upon return of the ﬂight samples to the NASA Glenn Research Center, they were removed from the
Kapron they were bagged in and photographed. Figure 6 compares the ﬂight samples (right) with control
samples (left) that were treated identically, but not ﬂown in space. It can be seen in the photograph that
space exposure darkened the fabrics and gave them a somewhat reddish tint. This will be explored
quantitatively in the spectroscopy section of the study. A dark streak was noted on the space-eXposed
sample (01) that stretches diagonally across the abraded FEP fabric. There was no evidence of this streak in
the pre-ﬂight photographs, and study of the ﬂight environment around this sample did not yield a
potential contamination source. No additional details were revealed when the samples were illuminated
by UV light. More discussion of the streak appears in the sections on EDS and optical spectroscopy.

It was noted that the silver plated stainless steel heX nuts which were below the capscrews shown in
Figure 6 turned black during the experiment. This was probably due to exposure to atomic oxygen (A0)
in LEO during those periods when the 188 was reoriented such that the samples were exposed to the ram
facing environment.

After the initial photography, the ﬂight samples were removed from the sample holder. After
removing the assembly screws, the sample holder was placed face down on a Kapron surface and the base
plate was removed. When the aluminum shims were removed to reveal the back of the samples, n0

indications of contamination were evident. When the samples were removed from the ﬂight holder, the
perimeter area of the fabric that was shielded from the environment by being under the edge of the sample
holder was readily Visible in Figure 7. Space exposure similarly darkened all of the samples. Each sample
was immediately transferred to its own sample handler (Ref. 5) so that they could be imaged in the optical
microscope, the FESEM, and the AFM without needing to further handle the fabrics.
3.2 Microscopic Imaging
3.2.1 Pristine FEP Fabric
Images of all PGA fabric samples before and after space exposure taken with the light microscope,
the FESEM, and the AFM are collected in appendices of the pre-ﬂight and post—ﬂight reports (Refs. 5 and
6). At low magniﬁcation, optical microscopy showed that during exposure on the 188 the pristine FEP
sample reddened in some places and darkened on the whole, probably due to space radiation. Occasional

"13","dark specks in most of the images which occasionally reﬂect the light (Figure 8) may be metallic debris,
most likely contamination debris which occurred during retrieval. Fabric near the edge of the sample
holder appears to be more reddened than the bulk of the fabric surface, though the source of the reddening
has not been identiﬁed. There were no areas of obvious mechanical damage to the ﬁber up to 100x in
magniﬁcation.

The most revealing images were obtained in the FESEM. The pre-ﬂight inspection noted the
existence of cracks in the individual ﬁbers, with ﬁlaments observed within them. These same cracks are
noted in the post-ﬂight images, and their structure looks the same. Similarly, the scuff marks and holes
noted in the sample pre-ﬂight were located post ﬂight with no noticeable change. At magniﬁcation
> 1000>< a new feature was seen (Figure 9). The entire surface has been textured with pits ranging 1 t0
4 pm long and about half as wide. The long part of the pit tends to run across the ﬁber width, rather than
its length. These features are also clearly Visible in the AFM, which shows that there is additional
structure in the ﬂoor of the pits. FESEM images taken from the samples pre-ﬂight and the post-ﬂight
region protected by the samples holder show no such texture, conﬁrming that the texturing is due to space
exposure. The most likely cause of the texture is AO erosion.

Figure 10.—AFM image of pristine FEP at a magnification of 10 pm square in an area of the
samples exposed to A0. The pit depth was determined from scale on the right to be
consistent with the 0.6 pm prediction of erosion. The line midway across the image is a
raster imaging artifact.

Although the experiment was located on the wake face of MISSE, and nominally did not see AO,
there was signiﬁcant AO exposure nonetheless. The largest AO dose occurred when the 188 was
reoriented, such as happened when docking to the Space Shuttle. At those times the “wake” face was
turned 1800 and was exposed to the AO rarn direction. The A0 ﬂuence on the wake face was monitored
by several other MISSE-7 experiments. For example, Finokenor has determined the wake side AO ﬂuenoe
to be 2.9i0.3 x 1020 atorns/orn2 using the method of erosion rate of Kapton HN (Ref. 11). This is about
7 percent of the rarn—side ﬂuence of 4.2i0.1 x 1021 atoms/ornz. Expressed another way, during the
554 days of space exposure, the wake-side samples experienced the equivalent of more than 38 days of
ram AO exposure.

The A0 erosion yield for FEP ﬁlms has been determined previously to be 2.00><10'25 orn3/atorn
(Ref. 12). This predicts that about 0.6 pm should have been etched away from the surface. AFM imaging
(Figure 10) suggests that the erosion pits have a depth consistent with that value.

3.2.2 Abraded FEP Fabric

Plastic deformation and smearing of the ﬁbers caused by the dust abrasion technique was noted in the
pre-ﬂight characterization, and was clearly in evidence in the post-ﬂight optical and FESEM microscopy
(Figure 11). So too were areas of scufﬁng and scribing caused by the dust abrasion. At high magniﬁcation
in the FESEM, etch structures that were noted in the pristine fabric were observed in the abraded areas as
well. However, their morphology was somewhat different. Whereas the pristine ﬁber exhibited closed
ring pits, the abraded fabric exhibited a series of nearly parallel ﬁlaments, which appear to protrude high
off of the surface (Figure 12). No post-ﬂight images of these samples could be obtained in the AFM, and
it is speculated that these structures frustrated attempts to obtain AFM images. As with the pristine

"
"15","sample, FESEM images taken from the region protected by the sample holder show no such texture,
conﬁrming that the texturing is most likely caused by atomic oxygen.

The outstanding feature of the abraded FEP sample was a dark streak that that was about 1 mm wide
and extended at an angle of about 400 from the corner near the Bean sample across nearly the entire
sample. In the optical microscope the streak appeared to be produced by the same process that darkens the
entire exposed sample of the surface. The color appeared to be the same and at higher magniﬁcation it can
be seen that the streak is not at all continuous. The colorant merely covers a larger fraction of the fabric
surface in the streak region. The streak does not extend into the region covered by the sample holder. No
evidence of a different structure, texture, or composition for the region of the streak was observed under
the FESEM.

"16","3.2.3 Alan Bean Apollo FEP Fabric

The optical and FESEM photomicrographs of the Bean sample pre-ﬁight are consistent with those
previously reported in the literature (Refs. 8 and 13). At high resolution the ﬁbers eXhibit little plastic
deformation, but appear to be shredded and to have a lot of embedded dust. The embedded dust gives the
fabric a much darker color than that imparted by the dust abrasion with the J SC-lA lunar simulant. This
characteristic shredding of the ﬁbers and embedded dust clearly seen in the post-ﬁight samples was still
present, however; as may be noted from Figure 13, there were many fewer places where shredded pieces
of ﬁber stand up off of the ﬁber. Images at magniﬁcation >1000>< showed texturing that is similar to that
seen on the other FEP fabric samples. Interestingly, there are regions where the etch pattern looks more
like the pristine ﬁber, and other areas that look more like the dust abraded ﬁber (Figure 14).

3.2.4 Pristine Ortho—Fabric

As with FEP, optical microscopy revealed that the Ortho-fabric darkened and reddened upon space
exposure. Interestingly, as can be seen in Figure 15, the weft had a much greater color change than the
warp. On the pre-ﬁight analysis triangular indentations scattered throughout the sample were noted, most
likely a result of the weaving process. There were some cracks on the surface and ﬁlaments in some of the
cracks. There were a few impact sites on the sample. One that left a 12 um wide crater is shown in Figure
16. No remnant of the proj ectile is seen. The texture seen within the crater implies that the impact
occurred before the sample was exposed to a signiﬁcant ﬂuence of AO.

Despite the color change, at low magniﬁcation the post—ﬁight ﬁber morphology appears unchanged
from the pre-ﬁight. But at magniﬁcation > lOOOx, like the FEP ﬁbers, the surface appeared to have been
etched by A0. The dimensions and morphology of the pits are the same as that seen in the FEP fabric.
Once again the edge where the sample was protected under the sample holder was also very similar to the
pre-ﬁight sample.

3.2.5 Abraded Ortho-Fabric
In the samples pre-ﬂight, the weft (top) ﬁbers were plastically deformed and scored by the dust-
abrasion process, and a considerable amount of dust remained trapped between the ﬁbers. These features
were also observed post—ﬂight (Figure 17). Like the pristine Ortho-fabric, the abraded Ortho-fabric was
darker and redder than pre-ﬂight, with the color change being dominated by the weft. The ﬁbers of this
fabric were also etched, generally in patterns resembling the post—ﬂight pristine Ortho-fabric. In some
ﬁbers, however, the damage was much more severe with a large fraction of the ﬁber being etched away
through the entire volume of the ﬁber (Figure 18). J udging by the ﬁber diameter, these were probably
Nomex ﬁbers rather than PTFE. The atomic oxygen yield for Nomex is 10x that of PTFE, and so more
than 4 pm of the ﬁber might have eroded (Ref. 12). As with the other samples, the edge where the sample
was protected under the sample holder appeared very similar to the pre-ﬂight sample.

3.2.6 Twice Abraded Ortho-fabric

The post-ﬂight appearance of the doubly abraded Ortho-fabric was Virtually identical to that of the
singly abraded Ortho-fabric. Thus, doubling the number of abrasion cycles, from 8,000 to 16,000 had no
measurable effect.

3.3 Energy Dispersive X—Ray Spectroscopy (EDS)

The EDS spectra of several samples were measured in order to determine whether the discoloration of
the samples was due to radiation damage or contamination. Since EDS measures elemental composition
of the samples, and FEP and PTFE signatures are simple and characteristic, containing only carbon and
ﬂuorine, contamination is easy to identify. EDS requires an electron beam of relatively high energy in
order to excite inner shell electrons, so the samples were gold coated before the measurements were
made. As a precaution, all samples were imaged thoroughly before the gold coating, and only a fraction of
each sample was coated.

The most obvious candidate for contamination was the dust-abraded FEP fabric which contained a
dark streak across it. The EDS spectrum taken of the area of the streak was identical with that of a
characteristic area where the sample was exposed to the space environment, and an area where the sample
was protected from the environment. The three spectra were Virtually identical, showing only carbon and
ﬂuorine peaks with an approximate formula of CF2, characteristic of FEP.

Similar results were obtained for all three Ortho-fabric samples. This implies that the darkening was
caused not by contamination, but by an interaction of the fabrics with radiation in the space environment.
Darkening of Teﬂon upon radiation exposure, but not on AO exposure, is well established (Refs. 14 and
15). Although this seems the most likely explanation, and is consistent with the even appearance of the
discoloration on ﬁve of the samples, it is difﬁcult to explain how the streak could appear in the abraded
FEP sample.

3.4 Total Reﬂectance Spectroscopy

The results of space exposure on the reﬂectance spectrum of the FEP fabrics are shown in Figure 19.
There was little change in the p(?t) for wavelengths longer than 800 nm in the pristine fabric (Figure
l9(a)). But there is a dramatic reduction in p(?t) below 800 nm that becomes greater as )L becomes shorter,
hence the reddening. This darkening and reddening is in the Visible region (A. = 400 to 700 nm) which is
clearly shown in the optical photographs as discussed above. The oc increased upon space exposure, as is

"20","shown in Table 1. Although other measurements of the space degradation of fabrics have not been
reported, the degradation of the aluminum backed F EP (AIFEP) bi-stem thermal shield of the HST over
8.3 yr has been reported. The cc of the pristine bi-stem AIFEP was 0.131 i 0.007, its much lower value
attributable to it being a smooth ﬁlm as opposed to a bundle of ﬁbers. On the solar-facing surface of the
exposed material this increased to a value of 0.179 i 0.031 and on the anti-solar facing surface to 0.127 i
0.011 (Ref. 16). This gives a ratio of apost_ﬂight/0tpre_ﬂight of 1.36 and 0.97 for the solar-facing and anti-solar
facing respectively. This implicates solar particle radiation directly in the darkening since, unlike EM
radiation, particle radiation does not strike the samples primarily line-of-sight from the Sun. The
translucent White of the pre-ﬂight pristine F EP fabric ﬁbers had a higher O(Ipristinea but had a comparable
0cmst_ﬂight/0t};,re_ﬂight of 1.3. A0 texturing of F EP shifts much of the specular Ct to diffuse, and also increases
0t, but does not result in the reddening in the UV-Visible region (Ref. 17).

"21","TABLE I.—INTEGRATED SOLAR ABSORPTANCE, 0L, FOR THE SIX
MISSE-7 SAMPLES, BEFORE AND AFTER SPACE EXPOSURE.

The spectra of the pristine FEP (Figure 19(a)) can be used to help interpret the dust abraded FEP
spectrum (Figure 19(b)). The functional form of the pre-ﬂight and post-ﬂight spectra for the dust abraded
FEP sample above 500 nm is similar, except that the abraded sample is less reﬂective. In fact, Figure
20(a) shows that a simple rule of mixtures calculation, Where 64 percent of the spectrum is due to the
J SC-lAF spectrum (Ref. 18) and the remainder is due to the FEP fabric, results in a reasonable ﬁt to the
measured dust-abraded FEP spectrum.

However, this same rule of mixtures behavior clearly does not hold post-ﬂight. The spectrum at 7»
longer than 800 nm becomes increasingly reﬂective With 7» (Figure 19(b)). This is a spectral characteristic
of lunar dust as well (Ref. 19). This spectral “reddening” can be seen in the Alan Bean suit spectrum
shown in Figure 19(0), Which was infused With lunar dust pre-ﬂight. These data seem to indicate that
radiation blocked by the Earth’s atmosphere is essential in the reddening mechanism. Note that the p(7»)
decreased on space exposure, but uniformly across the spectrum by about 0.10 (Figure 19(0)).

Taken together, it appears that space exposure has three p(7») effects on dust abraded FEP fabric.
First, exposure darkens and reddens FEP at 250 to 800 nm 7», but has little or no effect on FEP at 7» > 800
nm. The shortest 7»’s are most affected. Second, space exposure reddens the entrapped dust, With p(7»)
becoming increasing reﬂective at 7» > 800 nm. Third, space exposure darkens the dust, as evidenced by
the decrease in p(7») 0f the already reddened lunar dust in the Alan Bean space suit fabric.

Figure 21(b) shows that the p(7») 0f Ortho-fabric slightly increases on space exposure for 7» > 800 nm,
but drops dramatically below 800 nm, and like the FEP the difference becomes greater as 7» becomes
shorter. As With the FEP this darkening and reddening in the Visible region (400 to 700 nm) is also clearly
shown in the optical photographs (Figure 6). The 0c of pristine Ortho-fabric increases by 38 percent upon
space exposure (Table I).

Figure 21(0) shows the post-ﬂight spectra of the pristine, abraded, and twice abraded Ortho-fabric.
The reddening at 7» > 800 nm that was so striking in the FEP spectrum does not appear in the Ortho-fabric
spectrum. There is only a darkening of the spectrum 0n abrasion. The dust appears to have little if any
effect on the spectrum, implying that the dust-abraded spectrum is dominated by abrasion damage, rather
than by dust particles.

"23","3.5 Tensile Test

Tensile testing of single ﬁbers from the fabrics was problematic. Since the ﬂight specimens were so
small, the length of ﬁber available for gripping was limited to 2 to 3 mm on each end. And since the
ﬁbers were F EP it was difficult to sufﬁciently grip the ﬁbers over such a small length to exert a force
large enough to break the ﬁbers. Both the Ortho-fabric and the F EP had ﬁbers much too large (200 to
600 um) to break using our protocol. Only the ﬁlaments from the Alan Bean suit were sufﬁciently thin.
The average ﬁlament diameters were measured to be 23 i 3 um, and did not measurably change during
exposure. This indicates that the A0 etching observed in the microscopy was a surface effect and likely
did not contribute signiﬁcantly to mechanical degradation of the ﬁlaments.

The results of tensile testing of ﬁlaments from the Alan Bean sample are shown in Table II. The
ultimate tensile strength of the ﬁlaments decreased by a factor of 4.1 i 1.4, the elongation to failure
decreased by 4.3 i 2.0, and the modulus increased by a factor of 2.2 i 1.0. Shimamura has shown that A0
texturing in polyimide ﬁlms can lead to deep local valleys and surface cracks which can decrease the
tensile strength by as much as 30 percent (Ref. 20). But deep surface cracks were not observed in the
microscopy, and since the A0 exposure was not enough to signiﬁcantly reduce the ﬁlament diameters,
the bulk of the degradation was likely caused by exposure to space radiation. The mechanical properties
of the F EP ﬁlms of the thermal blankets of the HST degraded much more drastically than these samples,
but they had much longer space exposure (6.8 yr as opposed to 1.5 yr) (Ref. 4).

TABLE II.—CHANGE 1N TENSILE PROPERTIES OF ALAN BEAN FABRIC SAMPLES
AFTER 18 MONTHS EXPOSURE TO THE LEO WAKE ENVIRONMENT
--———
Fibers Pa Pa

It should be noted that the sample was taken from the left knee of Alan Bean’s suit, an area that
perhaps would see more wear than any other part of the suit. Nevertheless, the degradation in tensile
properties of lunar dust abraded spacesuit fabric when exposed to the space environment was substantial.
This must be taken into account when planning for long term missions to the lunar surface. The fabric had
been exposed to light wear, only being worn on the lunar surface for 7.8 hr, yet that combined with
18 months of space exposure decreased the tensile strength by a factor of four. Clearly, during a long
mission, the integrity of the fabric would beneﬁt from shielding it from solar radiation when it is not
being worn. It is unfortunate that data were unable to be obtained for pristine fabrics in order to determine
how much the dust abrasion changed the degradation properties. Somewhat larger samples including
pristine F EP fabric are currently being exposed on MlSSE-8, and may shed light on this.

4.0 Conclusions

SiX samples of pristine and dust abraded outer layer spacesuit fabrics were exposed to the wake LEO
environment on the 18$ for 18 months. Comparison of pre- and post-ﬂight characterizations showed that
space radiation darkened and reddened all siX fabrics. On space exposure, the cc of the F EP fabric
increased by 27 percent, and that of the Ortho-fabric increased by 38 percent. The cc of F EP fabric
abraded with J SC—lA increased by 7 percent, and J SC-lA abraded Ortho-fabric increased 9 percent. In
both cases most of their spectra could be explained as a linear addition of the fabric and the dust, though
the correlation did not hold in the Visible and UV wavelengths for the Ortho-fabric. Spectroscopically, the
lunar dust laden Apollo 12 sample darkened, but did not appreciably redden, though it appears redder to
the eye. No evidence of contamination was seen in the EDS results, suggesting that the discoloration was
due to radiation damage. Even though the samples were positioned on the wake side, because the ISS
periodically reorients the samples were exposed to the equivalent of about 38 days of ram A0. Evidence

"24","for this was seen in the oxidation of silver-coated fasteners and the etching of fabric ﬁbers. The erosion

seen in the ﬁbers was quantitatively consistent With previously reported values for the erosion yields of

the materials. Space exposure decreased the ultimate tensile strength and elongation to failure of the Alan

Bean Apollo 12 space suit ﬁlaments by a factor of four and increased the elastic modulus by a factor of

two. The severity of the degradation of the fabric samples over the 18 month exposure period

demonstrates the necessity to ﬁnd ways to prevent or mitigate radiation damage to spacesuits When
planning extended missions to the Moon.

14. ABSTRACT
Six samples of pristine and dust-abraded outer layer spacesuit fabrics were included in the Materials International Space Station
Experiment-7, in which they were exposed to the wake-side 10w Earth orbit environment on the International Space Station (188) for 18
months in order to determine whether abrasion by lunar dust increases radiation degradation. The fabric samples were characterized using
optical microscopy, optical spectroscopy, ﬁeld emission scanning electron microscopy, atomic force microscopy, and tensile testing before
and after exposure on the ISS. Comparison of pre- and post-ﬂight characterizations showed that the environment darkened and reddened all
six fabrics, increasing their integrated solar absorptance by 7 to 38 percent. There was a decrease in the ultimate tensile strength and
elongation to failure of lunar dust abraded Apollo spacesuit ﬁbers by a factor of four and an increase in the elastic modulus by a factor of
two.
