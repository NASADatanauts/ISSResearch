Although muscle atrophy is a serious problem during spaceﬂight, little is known about the sequence of molecular events leading to
atrophy in response to microgravity. We carried out a spaceﬂight experiment using Caenorhabditis elegans onboard the Japanese
Experiment Module of the International Space Station. Worms were synchronously cultured in liquid media with bacterial food for
4 days under microgravity or on a 1—6 centrifuge. Worms were visually observed for health and movement and then frozen. Upon
return, we analyzed global gene and protein expression using DNA microarrays and mass spectrometry. Body length and fat
accumulation were also analyzed. We found that in worms grown from the L1 larval stage to adulthood under microgravity, both
gene and protein expression levels for muscular thick ﬁlaments, cytoskeletal elements, and mitochondrial metabolic enzymes
decreased relative to parallel cultures on the 1-6 centrifuge (95% conﬁdence interval (P< 0.05)). In addition, altered movement and
decreased body length and fat accumulation were observed in the microgravity—cultured worms relative to the 1—6 cultured worms.
These results suggest protein expression changes that may account for the progressive muscular atrophy observed in astronauts.
