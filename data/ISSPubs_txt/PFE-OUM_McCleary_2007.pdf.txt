"5","Introduction
Aerobic deeonditioning occurs during long duration space ﬂight despite the use of
exercise countermeasures (Convertino, 1996). As a part of International Space Station
(188) medical operations, periodic tests designed to estimate aerobic capacity are
performed to track changes in aerobic fitness and to determine the effectiveness of
exercise countermeasures. These tests are performed prior to, during, and after missions
of greater than 30 days in duration.
Crewmembers selected for missions aboard the ISS perform a graded exercise test on a
cycle ergometer approximately 270 days prior to their scheduled launch date in order to
measure peak oxygen consumption (VOsz) and peak heart rate (HRpk). Approximately
30 to 45 days prior to launch, erewmembers perform a submaXimal cycle ergometer test
at work rates set to elicit 25 , 50 and 75% of their pre-ﬂight VOsz. This test, known as
the Periodic Fitness Evaluation (PFE), serves as a baseline measure to which subsequent
in-and post-ﬂight exercise tests are compared. While onboard the ISS, erewmembers are
normally scheduled to perform the PFE beginning with ﬂight day (FD) 14 and every 30
days thereafter. The PFE is also conducted 5 and 30 days following ﬂight.
Using PFE data, aerobic ﬁtness is estimated by quantifying the V02 vs. HR relationship
using linear regression and calculating the V02 that would occur at the erewmember’s
previously measured HRpk. Currently, for data collected during ﬂight, this technique
assumes that the pre- vs. in-ﬂight oxygen consumption per given cycle workload is
similar. However, the validity of this assumption is based upon a sparse amount of data
collected during the Skylab era (Michel, et a1. 1977). The method of using heart rate and
cycle ergometer work rates has been used to estimate aerobic fitness in normal graVity
(Astrand and Ryhming, 1954; Lee, 1993). Due to spaceﬂight induced physiological
alterations, such as shifts in extracellular ﬂuid (e.g. plasma) volume, this method may not
be valid during space ﬂight. In addition, the ergometer onboard 188 is Vibration-isolated
and moves with the astronaut’s application of force into the pedals. The effect of this
movement on the V02 of cycle exercise on 188 has not been quantiﬁed.
Though the measurement of V02 during 188 ﬂight has not been conducted to date, it has
been a long-waived requirement found within the International Space Station Medical
Operations Requirement Document (188 MORD), ReV C. An attempt to meet this
requirement was made using accessories for the Gas Analyzer System for Metabolic
Analysis Physiology (GASMAP). The GASMAP is a mass spectrometer and was
developed by the NASA’s 188 Human Research Facility (HRF) to support multiple
studies on-board 188, including measurements of V02 during exercise. However,
ground-based laboratory testing showed that, though the GASMAP mass spectrometer
performed well in the analysis of static gas samples, the software used to measure V02
was not accurate (A. Moore, personal communication, February 2000). Subroutines
within the software were unable to calibrate the turbine ﬂowmeter using a standard three
liter calibration syringe. Further, the delay calculation required to measure breath by
breath V02 was continuously out of phase and unable to align the expired gas fractions
with the corresponding expired ventilation measurement. When compared to the J ohnson
Space Center Exercise Physiology Lab’s (EXL) reference metabolic gas analysis system,
5

"
"6","the GASMAP was 24 and 11% higher for submaXimal workloads 0f 25 and 50% V02
peak, respectively. It was concluded that without further design and software
modiﬁcations, the GASMAP was not an adequate device for measuring V02 on 188. The
expense of engineering support and hardware modifications required to conﬁgure the
GASMAP to perform accurate measures of V02 was considered prohibitive at the time
and were not implemented.
A device capable of measuring exercise V02 on-board 188 has recently been developed
by a contractor to the European Space Agency. The device, known as the Pulmonary
Function Module/Photoacoustic Analyzer Module (PFM/PAM) is part of the ISS
Pulmonary Function System (PFS). For the purposes of this report, the PFS/PAM and
PFS will be referred to simply as the PPS. The PFS is located in the Human Research
Facility (HRF) Rack 2 0f the Destiny Laboratory on-board the 188. The manufacturer of
the PPS, Damee, (Damec Research ApS, Odense, Denmark) has a history of developing
equipment designed to measure the effects of microgravity 0n the human respiratory
system. Previous products by this company include the Respiratory Monitoring System
(RMS) for the Anthroraek used during the Space Lab missions, the RMS-II used during
the EuroMir 95 mission, and the Advanced Respiratory Monitoring System used aboard
STS-107.
The PFS system was initially launched to the ISS aboard STS-114 (LF 1) in July 2005 ,
followed by a hardware upgrade, which was launched on a Russian Progress supply
vehicle on April 2006. A collaborative effort has been initiated between NASA and BSA
Life Sciences personnel to integrate the use of the PPS into the PFE tests for the support
of Medical Operations obj ectives. J ensen et a1. (2002) performed an in depth comparison
of the AMIS 2001, the commercial version of the PPS, versus the standard Douglas bag
method and found that the system was reliable and accurate for measuring V02.
However, prudence dictates that an evaluation of the ﬂight—like PFS device is required to
determine if it provides valid metabolic gas analysis prior to implementation on-board
ISS.
Purpose
The purpose of this investigation was to compare exercise metabolic gas analysis
measurements (including V02) obtained by the PPS to those collected using a reference
metabolic gas analysis system (the ParvoMedics TrueOne© 2400 system). The
ParVOMedics TrueOne© 2400 system has been extensively validated (Basset, et a1, 2001;
Crouter, et a1, 2006) and is currently utilized by the NASA’s Exercise Physiology
Laboratory for pre- and post-ﬂight testing astronauts assigned to 188 ﬂights.
Methods
Subjects
Eight healthy male subj eets volunteered to perform two peak cycle tests over a period of
12 days (Table 1). A11 subj eets completed a modified Air—Foree Class III physical exam
prior to participation and received written and verbal explanations of test protocols before
6

"7","providing written informed consent. Test protocols and procedures were reviewed and
approved by the NASA-Johnson Space Center Committee for the Protection of Human
Subj eets.

Protocol
Each subj eet performed two peak cycle ergometer tests. The ergometer used for testing
was a LODE Excalibur Sport (LODE, AN Groningen, The Netherlands). Metabolic gas
analysis was accomplished using one of two systems in random order: the ParVOMedics
TrueOne© 2400 (ParVOMedies, Salt Lake City, UT) metabolic gas analysis system or the
PPS. Subj eets completed the two tests within a 12 day period. A minimum of 48 hours
was allowed between each test to prevent residual soreness and fatigue. Sessions were
conducted at approximately the same time of day, limiting variance to within i 2 hours of
the initial testing session to limit any circadian effect on physiological variance (Carter,
2002). Subj eets were also requested to maintain the same dietary and sleeping habits
throughout the testing period. Compliance was monitored through a subj eet screening
form that was completed by the subj eet before each test.
Metabolic gas analysis was conducted continuously throughout the cycle test protocol
(Figure 1). The cycle work rate was increased according to the protocol until the subj ect
indicated that they could no longer continue. Each subj ect was allowed to choose their
desired pedal cadence (revolutions per minute; RPM) and was required to maintain that
same cadence throughout the two tests. Lepers, et a1. (2001) found no difference in V02
when subj eets were allowed to choose their optimal cadence between 70 and 100 RPMs.
All test subj eets in the current evaluation maintained a pedal cadence within a range of
80- 100 RPMs.

Heart rate was measured electrocardiographically (Q-Stress, Quinton Instruments,
Seattle, WA) and blood pressure was measured using a mercurial sphygmomanometer
and stethoscope. Ratings of Perceived Exertion (RPE) were reported during the last 30
seconds of each stage. Blood pressure was not recorded above 250 watts (W) if the
subj eet showed a normal blood pressure response to increases in workload for workloads
below 250 W. Immediately post exercise, blood pressure was recorded and the subject
was monitored for any adverse effects caused by maximal exertion.
Metabolic Gas Analysis Systems Description
The ParvoMedics TrueOne© 2400 metabolic gas analysis system uses a paramagnetic
oxygen analyzer (operating range 0-25% 02) and an infrared single beam, single wave
length carbon dioxide analyzer (operating range 0-15% C02) to measure the composition
of expired gasses. The subj ect inspires through a two-way non-rebreathing valve (Hans
Rudolph M0de12700, Kansas City, MO, USA) and expired air composition is analyzed
in a 4 liter mixing chamber. The inspired gas composition is assumed to be standard
atmospheric values (i.e. 20.93% 02 and 0.03% C02). Expired ventilation is measured
using a Hans Rudolph Model 3813 linear pneumotaeh (operating ﬂow range 0-800
L/min). Computational software is provided with the system and runs with the Windows
XP Professional operating system.
The Damee Pulmonary Function System uses two types of technology for gas analysis.
For carbon dioxide, a photo-acoustic method of gas analysis is utilized. In this technique,
the gas sample is exposed to intermittent infrared light. The gas sample absorbs the light
8

"
"9","and the absorbed energy results in a rise in pressure by heating. The intermittent infrared
light is divided into different pulsation frequencies and is ﬁltered optically. Each optical
filter allows only a specific wavelength of light to pass through and the wavelengths
correspond to the infrared absorption spectra of the sample gasses. When the light-souree
is removed, the gas cools down, resulting in a pressure ﬂuctuation. By choosing a
pulsation frequency in the audible range, the pressure ﬂuctuation becomes an acoustic
signal which is detected by a microphone. The audible sounds recorded by the
microphone are analyzed and the amplitude of each signal is used to calculate the gas
concentration. The operating range for carbon dioxide is from 0—12%. Gasses other than
carbon dioxide can be detected utilizing the photo-aeoustie method, but an evaluation of
these was beyond the scope of our investigation. For oxygen analysis, an OxigraiT M
sensor is used in the PPS. The OxigraiTM technology is based on a laser diode absorption
spectroscopy technique. The sample gas is exposed to a laser tuned to a wavelength of
760 nm (the peak of oxygen absorption). The laser signal is attenuated in proportion to
the concentration of oxygen present in the sample. The operating range is from 0-100%.
When the PPS is used during exercise testing, the subj ect inspires through a custom-
designed (Damec Research Aps., Odense, Denmark) two-way non-rebreathing valve and
the expired gasses are sampled in a 15 liter anesthesia bag, which serves as a mixing
reservoir. Inspired gas concentrations are measured on the inspired side of the respiratory
circuit. This is done because inspired gas concentrations on board the spacecraft
typically deviate slightly from normal atmospheric values. Ventilation is measured on
the inspired side of the non-rebreathing valve using a Damec custom-designed
pneumotaeh (operating ﬂow range 0-900 L/min).
Metabolic Gas Analysis Data Reduction
Data were collected continuously by the ParVOMedics and PFS systems. Data were
averaged in 30-seeond intervals to the nearest whole breath. Peak V02 was accepted as
the highest V02 attained for a single 30-seeond period. The dependent variables in this
investigation were V02, carbon dioxide production (VCOz), pulmonary ventilation (VB),
and fractions of expired oxygen and carbon dioxide (F1302 and FECOz). Custom data
reduction templates were created using Microsoft Excel (Microsoft Corporation,
Redmond, WA).
Data collected using the ParVOMedics were automatically reduced to 30-seeond intervals
by the ParVOMedics software. The exported data were further reduced using a data
reduction template and averaged over the last 30-seeonds of each stage. The
ParVOMedics sampled the QRS signal directly from the Q-Stress ECG system and
calculated heart rate. Heart rate data were reduced in the same fashion as the metabolic
gas analysis variables.
Damee provided a Ground Support Equipment (GSE) software package to calculate the
dependent measures from the raw data signals measured by the PPS. Similar to the
ParVOMedics data, all PFS data were reduced in 30-seeond intervals and exported to
Excel. A data cable to collect heart rate data from the Q-Stress ECG system directly by

template from the Q-Stress ECG printout.
Data Analysis
Data analysis for each dependent variable was conducted as a series of pre-planned
comparisons (dependent T-tests with a Bonferroni adjustment made for multiple
comparisons). This data reduction strategy was selected instead of the more traditional
analysis of variance for two reasons. The ﬁrst is that the dependent measurements (V02,
VCOz, and VB) will increase with exercise intensity — there was no need for a statistical
test to corroborate a physiological certainty. The second is that the primary question of
interest involves determining if the measured metabolic gas analysis variables differed
between the devices at any stage of exercise. Testing of this question is much more
straightforward using preplanned comparisons. A significant difference was deemed to
occur if p<0.05. A linear regression analysis comparing the V02 data collected from both
devices across all exercise stages was also performed and confidence intervals developed
for the slope and intercept of the relationship. Finally, a comparison of the peak V02
data attained from each of the devices was performed using a paired T-test.
Results
The average work rate attained by the subj ects was 319 i 53 W. All subj ects completed
each exercise stage through 250 W. Therefore, the planned comparisons of the
dependent variables were conducted at 100, 150, 200 and 250 W.
Oxygen Consumption (V02)
Oxygen consumption did not differ between devices at 100, 200, and 250 W; however, a
statistically signiﬁcant difference between the devices was observed at the 150 W stage
(Figure 2). The percent difference in V02 between the two devices was 5.4% at this
stage. When the V02 values measured on the ParVOMedics and the PPS were compared
using linear regression, the Pearson-Product moment correlation was high (r=0.987),
indicating that 97.5% of the variance observed in the measure was shared between the
two devices (Figure 3). In addition, the intercept of the relationship was not signiﬁcantly
different than 0 and the slope of the relationship did not differ from 1.0. The peak
oxygen consumption of the subj ects did not differ between the two systems
(ParVOMedics: 4.47 i 0.73 L/min; PFS: 4.64 i 0.77 L/min, a 3.8% difference).

"13","Discussion
Comparison of metabolic gas analysis systems is complicated by human variability in
day-to-day exercise responses and performance. One way to control for day-to-day
variation in exercise responses is to test both systems simultaneously, either in series or
in parallel. While this is possible using some systems, the investigators of the current
study and the designers of the hardware concluded that use of the ParvoMedios system
and the PPS simultaneously may induce error related to a novel test set up. For example,
if the ParvoMedios was sampling “in-line” past the PPS, the increased pressure of gas
passing through the ParvoMedios may change the mixing bag characteristics of the PPS.
Thus, two separate tests were performed on the subj eots. While every attempt was made
to limit variation, including limiting testing for subj eots to the same time of day, it has
been reported that day to day variability in V02 ranges from 4 to 6% (Shephard, et al,
1984), while others have reported variability in VOzpk as high as 10 to 12% (Versteeg, et
al, 1989).
The ParvoMedios reference system and the PPS measures of V02 did not statistically
differ for the majority of exercise stages examined (Figure 2). For the 150 W stage, the
systems did statistically differ by 5.4%. This appears to be a random ﬁnding that has no
apparent physiological or methodological explanation. One of the subj eots did
experience an unusually large difference between the two devices at that stage (2.49
L/min PFS vs. 2.17 L/min ParvoMedios, a 14.7% difference), and this undoubtedly
contributed to the statistical difference. Consideration was given to removing the subj eot
as an “outlier” from the data set, but because of the small sample size and the fact that all
of the other stage data appeared normal for this subj eot, he was retained in the data set.
From a clinical relevance stand-point, a 5.4% difference, i.e., the difference between the
mean values of the two systems at 150 W, is within most of the day-to-day variations of
V02 reported in the literature; therefore, based upon the stages of exercise examined, the
two devices exhibited acceptable agreement. In addition, the peak V02 of the subj eots
demonstrated a non-signifioant difference of 3.8% between the two devices, also within
the ranges reported in the literature of day-to-day variation in peak V02.
The V02 relationship between the two systems shows that the systems exhibit very close
agreement. One would expect high agreement between two devices designed to measure
the same physiological parameter, thus a high Pearson product moment coefﬁcient of
correlation (r); however, a high r alone does not ensure that the results between the two
devices are similar (Bland and Altman, 1986). If a high r is coupled with the slope of the
relationship being approximately 1.0, and an intercept near 0, the two devices can be
judged as yielding similar results (Moore, et al, 1997). In the case of the current
evaluation, the slope of the relationship between the ParvoMedios and PFS measurements
of V02 did not signiﬁcantly differ from 1.0, nor did the intercept differ from zero.
Interestingly, no differences were seen in expired pulmonary ventilation (VB), even
though the systems compute pulmonary ventilation using differing methods. Both the
FPS and ParvoMedios use a differential pressure pneumotaoh to measure ﬂow; however,
the PPS measures ﬂow on the inspiratory side, while the ParvoMedios measures ﬂow on
the expiratory side. The software of both systems uses the Haldane Transformation

13

"
"14","correction (Luft, 1973) to correct for the differences in inspiratory and expiratory
ventilation When calculating V02 and VCOz. The PFS measures inspired ventilation,
rather than the more traditional expired measurement, to minimize the chance of
condensation 0r saliva contamination 0n the pneumotaeh surface. This design feature is
important for space ﬂight because traditional methods to reduce contamination from
moisture contained in expired gas rely on gravity and thus would not work in the ISS
environment.
Use of the PPS during exercise testing on-board 188 should provide improved accuracy
of the estimates of aerobic ﬁtness Which currently rely on the assumption that V02 per
given workload is similar on 188 to preﬂight measurements. However, the prediction of
peak oxygen uptake from the heart rate response to submaXimal exercise, even With gas
exchange measurements, Will still have limited accuracy. If accurate aerobic capacity
measurements are desired by NASA, serious consideration must be given to the
performance of maximal exercise testing With metabolic gas analysis.
In conclusion, laboratory evaluation of the PPS demonstrated that it provides similar
results to those measured by the reference metabolic gas analysis system. It is
recommended that the PPS be incorporated into the standard periodic ﬁtness evaluation
testing performed on board 188.
