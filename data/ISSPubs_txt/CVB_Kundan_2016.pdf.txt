ARTICLE INFO ABSTRACT

Article history: The Constrained Vapor Bubble (CVB) is a transparent, wickless heat pipe experiment carried out in the

Recewed 9 Odd)“ 2015 US Labs of the International Space Station ([55). Experiments were carried out using the 40 mm CVB,

Performance limitation to force it away from the heater and ultimately, dry out the hot end. The CVB experiment shows that high

Dry'OUt' HOOdmg temperature gradients lead to a totally opposite behavior, i.e., ‘ﬂooding’ of the heated end. Flooding of
the heater end is attributed to a competition between Marangoni—induced ﬂow due to high temperature
gradients at the heater end and capillary return ﬂow from the cooler. This creates a thick liquid layer in
the corner of the cuvette at the heater end. At the point of ﬂow balance, a thick layer of liquid is observed
on the ﬂat surface of the quartz cuvette. This is deﬁned as the central drop. The region from the top of
the heater end to the central drop is referred to as the interfacial ﬂow region. The interfacial ﬂow region
develops at a power input of around 0.7 W, and increases in length to the power input of 2W. At 2W,
the strength of the Marangoni forces saturate. As a result, the forces in the ﬂooded interfacial region are
not able to push the liquid further into the capillary region and a further penetration of liquid down the
axis of the heat pipe is arrested. As the power input is increased to nearly 3W, an increase in the vapor
space is observed near the heater end at 3W. This behavior suggests that the ﬂooding might just be an
intermediate stage in reaching the dry—out limitation.

The ﬂat quartz surface at the hot end is covered by a wavy thin liquid ﬁlm due to the interfacial
forces. The hot end region closest to the heater is a superheated vapor region that leads to the conden—
sation. This additional observation is discussed in Appendix.
