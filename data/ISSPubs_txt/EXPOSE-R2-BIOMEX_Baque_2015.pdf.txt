Abstract The space mission EXPOSE-R2 launched on the 24th of July 2014 to the Interna-
tional Space Station is carrying the BIOMEX (BIOlogy and Mars EXperirnent) experiment
aimed at investigating the endurance of extremophiles and stability of biomolecules under
space and Mars—like conditions. In order to prepare the analyses of the returned samples,
ground-based simulations were carried out in Planetary and Space Simulation facilities. During
the ground-based simulations, Chroococcidiopsis cells mixed with two Martian mineral
analogues (phyllosilicatic and sulfatic Mars regolith simulants) were exposed to a Martian
simulated atmosphere combined or not with UV irradiation corresponding to the dose received
during a 1-year—eXposure in low Earth orbit (or half a Martian year on Mars). Cell survival and
preservation of potential biomarkers such as photosynthetic and photoprotective pigments or
DNA were assessed by colony forming ability assays, confocal laser scanning microscopy,
Raman spectroscopy and PCR—based assays. DNA and photoprotective pigments (carotenoids)
were detectable after simulations of the space mission (570 MJ/rn2 of UV 200—400 nm
irradiation and Martian simulated atmosphere), even though signals were attenuated by the
treatment. The ﬂuorescence signal from photosynthetic pigments was differently preserved
after UV irradiation, depending on the thickness of the samples. UV irradiation caused a high

copy. Further investigation will be needed to ensure unambiguous identiﬁcation and operations
of future Mars missions. However, a 3-month exposure to a Martian simulated atmosphere
showed no signiﬁcant damaging effect on the tested cyanobacterial biosignatures, pointing out
the relevance of the latter for future investigations after the EXPOSE-R2 mission. Data
gathered during the ground-based simulations will contribute to interpret results from space
experiments and guide our search for life on Mars.

Introduction

Cyanobacteria are among the oldest life forms on Earth, with ear1iest evidence in the
fossil record between 3.5 and 2.8 billion years ago (Schopf 2002; Schwartzman et a1.
2008; Bosak et a1. 2013), at a time when environmental conditions (noteworthy water
availability and UV irradiation) are thought to be similar on the Earth and on Mars
(McKay 1997; Wynn—Williams and Edwards 2000). If life eXists on present-day Mars, it
is likely underground and photosynthesis-independent, given the harsh conditions at the
surface where solar light is available (see, e.g., Westa11 et a1. 2013; Cockell 2014).
However, if environmental conditions on Mars were life-permissive long enough for life
to originate there (McKay 2010; Westa11 et a1. 2013; Cockell 2014) and to evolve
metabolic systems as complex as oxygenic photosynthesis, and/or if life was exchanged
between the two planets (see, e.g., Nicholson 2009), remains from life forms analogous to
desiccation- and radiation-resistant cyanobacteria or other photosynthetic microorganisms
might still eXist and be detectable on Mars.

Since the Viking 1anders in 1976, no hardware landed on Mars was dedicated to the search
for life there. However, two rovers planned to be sent to Mars in the near future will be so: the
ExoMars (Barnes et a1. 2006; Vago et a1. 2006) and Mars 2020 (Fries et a1. 2010) rovers will
carry instruments to detect organic molecules and potential biomarkers on Mars in 2018—2020.
Miniaturized Raman spectrometers such as the Raman Laser Spectrometer (Barnes et a1. 2006;
Vago et a1. 2006; Hutchinson et a1. 2014) will be on-board the ExoMars rover, while an UV
Raman spectrometer will be on-board Mars2020 (Tarcea et a1. 2007; Fries et a1. 2010).

Studies on terrestrial life in extreme environments guide our instrument choices and target
biosignatures for future missions to Mars (Horneck 2000; Rothschild and Mancine11i 2001).
Extensive ﬁeld and laboratory investigations have focused on carotenoids and photosynthetic
pigments in Mars terrestrial analogues, for instance Via the development of Raman and
ﬂuorescence emission techniques (Edwards et al. 2005a; Vitek et al. 2009a; Smith et a1.
2012; J orge-Villar and Edwards 2013; Groemer et a1. 2014). In preparation for future missions
to Mars, a focus was given to their optimization in the presence of Martian analogue minerals
(Vitek et al. 2009a; Bottger et a1. 2012; Vandenabeele et a1. 2012; J ehlicka et a1. 2014) along
with the assessment of potential biosignature degradation under Mars—like conditions (Dartne11
et a1. 2011, 2012; Dartne11 and Patel 2013; Stromberg et a1. 2014).

In addition, technologies based on laser excitation of autoﬂuorescent biomolecules
have been proposed to survey potential target regions on Mars before further analysis
(Grifﬁths et a1. 2008; Storrie-Lombardi and Sattler 2009; Dartne11 and Patel 2013;
Smith et al. 2014b). In this context, cyanobacteria are relevant models as they contain

photoprotective and antioxidant molecules (e.g., carotenoids), ultraviolet screening
compounds (e.g., scytonemin), photosynthetic pigments (e.g., chlorophyll a and
phycobiliproteins) and their degradation products (e.g., porphyrins), which have been
classified as high priority targets for biomolecule detection (Parnell et al. 2007).
Among them [3-carotene is of particular interest due to its stability and easy identi-
ﬁcation by Raman spectroscopy (due to a strong Raman resonance effect), even when
embedded in a mineral matrix (e.g., Wynn-Williams and Edwards 2000; Edwards
et al. 2005b; Vitek et al. 2010; Bottger et al. 2012; Vandenabeele et al. 2012).
Moreover, even fossilized carotenoids (such as carotane) remain easily identiﬁable
by Raman spectroscopy (Marshall and Marshall 2010); carotenoids and fossil carot-
enoids (such as carotane) were identified with GC/MS and Raman spectroscopy in
1.44 million-year-old halite brine inclusions (Winters et al. 2013) and in 1.64-billion-
year-old samples, respectively (Lee and Brooks 2011).

Likewise, DNA is also considered a high priority biosignature target due to its ubiquity in
organisms on Earth (Parnell et al. 2007; Lyon et al. 2010; Martins 2011). Instruments for its
detection on Mars, based on biochip technologies (Parro et al. 2008; Martins 2011; Parro et al.
2011; Sims et al. 2012) or PCR methods (Isenbarger et al. 2008; Carr et al. 2013), are under
development.

To ensure unambiguous identiﬁcation of potential biomarkers, degradation of biosignatures
by environmental stressors and potential interference of surrounding minerals should be taken
into account. In this context, the BIOlogy and Mars EXperiment (BIOMEX) aims at investi-
gating not only the endurance of extremophiles mixed with Lunar and Martian mineral
analogues, but also the stability/degradation of their macromolecules under space and Mars-
like conditions (de Vera et al. 2012). BIOMEX is one of the four astrobiology experiments of
the European Space Agency (ESA) EXPOSE-R2 mission, started on the 24th of July 2014
with its launch to the International Space Station (188) and its installation on the 18th of
August 2014 on the outside of the Russian Zvezda module. In the EXPOSE-R2 facility, the
astrobiological samples will be exposed to space and simulated Martian conditions for 12—
18 months (de Vera et al. 2012).

Among the selected extremophiles and macromolecules for the BIOMEX experi-
ment is a desert cyanobacterial strain, Chroococcidiopsis sp. CCMEE 029. The
endurance of this cyanobacterium under extreme conditions including deserts on Earth
(Friedmann 1980; Grilli Caiola and Billi 2007; Billi et al. 2013), prolonged laboratory
air-dry storage (at least up to 4 years; Billi 2009), high doses of ionizing radiation (up
to 15 kGy; Billi et al. 2000) and UVC irradiation (up to 13 kJ/niz; Baque et al.
2013b) makes it a relevant model when assessing biosignature stability over prolonged
periods under Martian-simulated conditions.

In the present paper, we investigated the role on the preservation of cyanobacterial
biosignatures of Phyllosilicatic Mars Regolith Simulant (P-MRS) and Sulfatic Mars Regolith
Simulant (S—MRS). P-MRS and S—MRS reﬂect minerals formed during the Noachian (Early
Mars) and Hesperian/Amazonian (Late Mars) epochs, respectively (Bibring et al. 2006;
Mustard et al. 2008; Bottger et al. 2012; de Vera et al. 2012; Ehlmann and Edwards
2014). Our main motivation is to contribute to the search for traces of life forms naturally
present on Mars, but these biosignatures might also be useful for the detection of human
cyanobacterial contamination of Mars caused by human activity. Such contamination might
come from spacecraft contaminated on the ground or, in a more distant future, leak from a
biological life support system (see VerseuX et al. 2015). As a secondary objective, we also

assessed the survival of Chroococcidiopsis spp. under space- and Mars-like stress factors.
Such data can be elements in the debate around the lithopanspermia theory (for a review, see
Nicholson 2009), but might also be useful in the assessment of the risk of Mars’s contam-
ination by terrestrial cyanobacteria. The experiments reported here were performed in the
framework of ground-based Scientiﬁc Veriﬁcation Tests (SVTs), using facilities of the
Planetary and Space Simulation (PSI) at the DLR-Institute of Aerospace Medicine in Koln
(Germany) and for analysis the Astrobiology Raman Lab at the DLR-Institute of Planetary
Research in Berlin (Germany) and the Department of Biology of the University of Rome Tor
Vergata (Italy), in preparation of future analyses of samples from the BIOMEX experiment.
Dried cells of Chroococcidiopsis sp. CCMEE 029 mixed with P-MRS or S—MRS were
exposed to a Mars—like atmosphere in combination or not with 570 M J/ni2 of polychromatic
UV radiation (200—400 nm). This UV dose simulated the one expected in a 1-year exposure
mission in low Earth orbit, or 383 sols on the Martian surface {Cockell et al. 2000; Rabbow
et al. 2012; DacheV et al. 2014; Rabbow et al. 2014). After exposure, the detectability of
biosignatures from photosynthetic pigments (chlorophyll a and phycobiliproteins), the
photoprotective pigment B-carotene and DNA, was evaluated by confocal laser scanning
microscopy, Raman spectroscopy and PCR-based assay, respectively. In addition,
cyanobacterial survival was assessed by testing colony forming ability.

Material and Methods

Culture Conditions, Martian Mineral Analogues and Sample Exposure
Chmococcidiopsis sp. CCMEE 029 was isolated by Roseli-Ocampo Friedmann from
cryptoendolithic growth in sandstone in the Negev Desert (Israel). The strain is part of the
Culture Collection of Microorganisms from Extreme Environments (CCMEE) established by
E. Imre Friedmann and now maintained at the Department of Biology of the University of
Rome Tor Vergata. Cyanobacteria were grown under routine conditions at 25 0C in BG—ll
medium under a photon ﬂux density of 40 umol/mZ/s provided by ﬂuorescent cool-white
bulbs with a 16/8 h light/dark cycle.

Multilayered planktonic samples were obtained by plating pellets from 2-month-old liquid
cultures (~2 X 109 cells) on top of BG-ll agarized medium and mixed (or not) with ~0.2 g of a
Mars regolith analogue mixture, either Phyllosilioatic Mars Regolith Simulant (P-MRS) or
Sulfatic Mars Regolith Simulant (S—MRS). The composition of the two Mars mineral ana-
logues (Table 1) was prepared by the Naturkunde—Museum (Berlin) in the framework of the
Helmholtz-Alliance “Planetary Evolution and Life”. Size distribution of the two mineral
mixtures is reported in Fig. 1. Samples were allowed to dry before cutting disks to the size
of the exposure carrier cells (~115 mmz) under sterile conditions. Following the accommoda-
tion plan scheduled for the EXPOSE platform, SVTs allowed only one replicate per sample (de
Vera et al. 2012).

Samples were exposed inside the PSI chamber to a simulated Martian atmosphere (95.55 %
C02, 2.70 % N2, 1.60 % Ar, 0,15 % 02, ~ 370 ppm H20, Praxair Deutschland GmbH) to a
ﬁnal pressure of 780 Pa for 89 days, in combination or not with polychromatic UV (200—
400 nm) radiation produced by the solar simulator SOL2000. The dose of 570 MJ/m2 was
reached by running the SOL2000 for 125 hours at 1271 W/niz. Neutral density ﬁlters
attenuating 99.9 % of the radiation spectrum (0.1 % ND ﬁlter) were used for samples exposed

constant monitoring of the temperature during irradiation to avoid the risk of sample heating.
Temperature varied from —25 to 30 oC throughout the experiment but remained below 10 0C
during irradiation times. Laboratory controls were kept at DLR in the dark, at room
temperature.
Confocal Laser Scanning Microscopy
Microscopy analyses were performed on fragments of approximately 2 mmz, using a
confocal laser scanning microscope (CLSM; Olympus Fluoview 1000 Confocal Laser
Scanning System) coupled with spectral analysis (CLSM-Ascan). Photosynthetic pig-
ment chlorophyll a and phycobiliproteins autoﬂuorescence was investigated by suc-

emitted ﬂuorescence in the 555—609 and 655—755 nm channels, respectively. Mineral
reﬂectance was recorded after excitation at 488 nm by collecting the reﬂective signal
between 490 and 510 nm. Three-dimensional images were captured every 0.5 pm and
processed with Imaris V. 6.1.0 software (Bitplane AG Ziirich, Switzerland) to obtain
maximum intensity projections. The spectral analysis of regions of interest (ROI) was
performed using the 543-nm laser at 54 % 0f the maximum power (0.54 mW) and
collecting the emission from 543 to 800 nm. Mean ﬂuorescence intensity (MFI) was
measured on 71215 cells from three different areas. Spectral analyses on minerals were
performed using the 488 and 543-nrn lasers at 1 mW and collecting the emission of
ROIs from 488 to 800 nm and from 543 to 800 nm, respectively. Curve plotting and
normalization were performed using the GraphPad Prism program (GraphPad Soft-
ware, San Diego, CA).

wavelength was 532 nm, which is the value proposed for the RLS instrument on
EXOMars, and the surface laser power 1 mW, a compromise between measurement
time in the lab and the RLS irradiance values (Hutchinson et a1. 2014). The spectral
resolution of the spectrometer was 4—5 Gm_1. A Nikon 10X objective was used to
focus the laser on a 1.5 pm spot. Based on the optimizations made by Béttger et a1.
(2012) for the detection of B-carotene in the same mineral matrices, acquisition time
was kept at 1 s to avoid signal saturation from chlorophyll ﬂuorescence with 1

and up to 2500 image points were obtained. The coverage of the B-carotene signal on
image scans was calculated in two steps. First, signal recognition was achieved using
the width filter function of the WITec Project software, centered on the three main
peaks of the B-carotene spectrum (990<1009<1030, 1140<1159<1170 and 1490<
1518<1550 cm-l), to generate image masks so that white areas denote B-carotene

Random Amplification of Polymorphic DNA (RAPD) Assay
Small fragments (about 2 mmz) of control and exposed dried samples were resuspended
in 50 11L of sterile MilliQ water, washed twice by centrifuging 10 min at 10,000 rpm
and resuspended in 20 11L sterile MilliQ water. They were then subjected to three
cycles of freeze-thawing (—80 °C for 10 min and 60 0C for 1 min) and boiled for
10 min. After centrifugation, 5 tLL 0f lysed cell suspensions were used for PCR
ampliﬁcation with the HIPl-CA primer (5'-GCGATCGCCA-3'). PCR conditions were
as follows: 94 °C for 3 min, 30 cycles at 94 °C for 30 s, 37 °C for 30 s and 72 °C for
1 min, and 72 0C for 7 min. Genomic DNA from l-month-old cultures of
Chroococcidiopsis was used as control. PCR products were loaded on a 1.5 % agarose
gel and electrophoresis was run at 90 V in TAE buffer. RAPD patterns were revealed
under UV lamp with ethidium bromide staining.

Survival Assessment
Irradiated samples were diluted in BG11 and plated on agarized BG11 medium. Plates were
incubated under routine conditions and formed colonies were scored. Chroococcidiopsis
usually forms cell aggregates of 2 to 10 cells; each aggregate was here counted as one colony
forming unit (CFU). Due to the low amount of samples exposed when 110 survivors were
scored 011 the ﬁrst attempt, the number of cells per plate was increased from 106 to 108.

to 2—3 cell layers when mixed with S—MRS (Fig. 2a and b), but were signiﬁcantly thicker when
mixed with P-MRS with a total thickness of about 15 um corresponding to 4—5 cell layers
(Fig. 2c and d). This is probably due to the different grain size distribution in the two prepared
analogues, P-MRS presenting thinner grains than S-MRS (Fig. 1). After exposure to simulated
Martian atmosphere, CLSM analysis revealed that 110 morphological alteration occurred in
dried cells mixed with S—MRS (Fig. 2b) 0r P-MRS (Fig. 2d) compared to controls (not shown).
On the other hand, exposure to simulated Martian atmosphere in combination with 5 70 MJ/rn2
0f polychromatic UV irradiation resulted in bleached photosynthetic pigments and altered cell
morphology in cells mixed with S—MRS (Fig. 2a) or with P-MRS (Fig. 2c, upper left corner).
However, cells with an unaltered morphology and unbleached photosynthetic pigments were
scored in samples mixed with P-MRS (Fig. 2c, middle).

CLSM-hscan with a 543-nm laser was used to reveal the effect of simulated Martian
atmosphere and polychromatic UV radiation on the emission spectrum of the photosynthetic
pigments of dried cells of Chroococcidiopsis sp. CCMEE 029 mixed with P-MRS (Fig. 3a) or
S—MRS (Fig. 3b). Cells from liquid culture showed an emission spectrum with a peak at 65 0—
660 nm due to the overlapping emission of phycobiliproteins (phycocyanin and
allophycocyanin) and chlorophyll a (Roldan et a1. 2004). The emission spectrum of dried
cells without minerals was identical to that of liquid controls (not shown), whereas the
emission spectrum of unexposed dried cells mixed with P-MRS 0r S—MRS presented an

altered shape, shifted towards lower wavelengths starting from 580 nm instead of 600 nm
(Fig. 3a and b). However, the maximum emission intensity at 653 nm was not signiﬁcantly
different to that of controls, with 104.1i4.1 % for P-MRS and 104.6i5.3 % for S—MRS at
653 nm (Table 2). In addition, the emission spectrum of dried cells mixed with P-MRS or S-
MRS showed a peak at 563 nm that was signiﬁcantly higher than that of control, 34.0i7.5 %
for P-MRS and 31.0i4.1 % for S-MRS compared to 4.6i0.4 % for cells in liquid culture
(Table 2). These differences might be due to minerals interfering with ﬂuorescence excitation
and emission; indeed, the maximum projection images showed a high reﬂectance of the
minerals (Fig. 2b and (1). Furthermore, when mineral particles spotted on a glass slide without
cells were excited with the 543-nm laser, an emission peak at 543 nm, extending to ~5 80 nm,
occurred and can be attributed to reﬂectance (Fig. 4). Comparable results were obtained with
the same cyanobacterial strain mixed with anorthosite (Baqué et a1. 2014), which is a dominant
component in Lunar regolith (Ashwal 1993).

The maximum emission intensity of the emission spectrum of the photosynthetic pigments
of dried cells mixed with P-MRS 0r S—MRS was not affected by the exposure to simulated
Martian atmosphere (representing 95.8i5.6 and 104.0i1.7 % 0f the maximum emission
intensity of the spectrum of cells from liquid culture, respectively). However, the lower
wavelength shift observed in unexposed dried cells mixed with minerals was less evident in
S—MRS than in P-MRS samples. This was probably due to a reduced mineral interference in

the regions selected for the analysis (not shown), as supported by the lower emission at 563 nm
of S—MRS (3.5i0.5 %) than P-MRS (16.7146 %).

Exposure to simulated Martian atmosphere combined with 570 MJ/m2 of polychromatic
UV resulted in an overall bleaching of the photosynthetic pigments in cells mixed with
minerals, as pointed out by a reduction in the emission peak at 653 nm (compared to the
liquid control) for S—MRS and P-MRS down to, respectively, 1.6i0.1 and 4.4i0.1 % (Fig. 3).
However, the non-homogeneous cell-mineral association and the thin layering of the dried
samples (Fig. 2) impaired an easy discrimination between top and bottom layers, as previously
reported for thick-dried bioﬁlms (Baqué et al. 2013a). CLSM-Ascan analysis showed cells in
P-MRS sample with an emission peak at 653 nm reduced to either 57.9i4.3 or 1.6i0.1 %,
thus reﬂecting the presence of differently shielded cells as shown in Fig. 2c. Results are
summarized in Table 2.

Moreover, some ﬂuorescent minerals were spotted on both Martian analogues with two
small emission peaks at 620 and 660 nm, as shown on the fully exposed sample with the P-
MRS analogue (Fig. 3a). Mineral ﬂuorescence from both preparations (without cells) was
therefore further investigated with both the 488 and 543 nm lasers. The emission spectra of
both mineral analogues produced ﬂuorescent peaks, most notably around 620 and 660 after
543 nm excitation. In addition, high reﬂectance peaks, extending from 490 to 520 nm after
488 nm excitation and from 550 to 580 nm after 543 nm excitation, were observed (Fig. 4).
Preservation of B-Carotene as Revealed by Raman Spectroscopy

spectra of Chroococcidiopsis sp. CCMEE 029 mixed with S—MRS (Figs. 5 and 7a) or P-MRS
(Figs. 6 and 8a). The 1518 and 1159 cm_1 bands are strong and characteristic for the C=C and
C—C stretching Vibrations while the smaller feature at 1009 cm_1 corresponds to the rocking

modes of the CH3 groups (Vitek et al. 2010). Chlorophyll a ﬂuorescence is also present as a
broad band centered at 3500 cm—1 due to the 532 nm excitation laser used.

Average spectra generated from image scans described the global behaVior of the
samples before and after exposure to the Martian simulations (Figs. 5 and 6). The [3-
carotene features were dominant in both unexposed mineral matrices (Figs. 5 and 6,
control, green spectra) and occurred after exposure to simulated Martian atmosphere
(Figs. 5 and 6, blue spectra). However, the combination of simulated Martian atmosphere
with 570 MJ/m2 of polychromatic UV caused the disappearance of B-carotene features
from the average spectra for cells mixed with S—MRS (Fig. 5, red spectrum) or P-MRS
(Fig. 6, red spectrum). In the same way, the strong chlorophyll a ﬂuorescence was
present in unexposed samples (controls), as expected from a typical cyanobacterial
spectrum (Figs. 5 and 6, green spectra), but its intensity was slightly reduced after exposure
to simulated Martian atmosphere only (Figs. 5 and 6, blue spectra) and completely disappeared
after exposure to all simulated Martian conditions (5 70 MJ/m2 polychromatic UV and simulated
Martian atmosphere) for both mineral matrices (Figs. 5 and 6, red spectra). Characteristic
minerals of both analogues could be identiﬁed in spite of using a non-optimal low acquisition
time (1 s), as described by Bottger et al. (2012), but [3-carotene and chlorophyll completely
dominated the overall spectra (not shown). Another surprising feature noted for both mineral
matrices (but stronger for the S—MRS analogue) was the high increase in ﬂuorescence back-
ground with a maximum around 1400 cnf1 after exposure to polychromatic UV (Figs. 5 and 6,
red spectra) which is not connected to the above mentioned chlorophyll a ﬂuorescence but
equivalent to the 575 nm emission noted on Fig. 4.

Nevertheless, the identiﬁcation of the three characteristic bands of [3-carotene remained
possible even on the highly ﬂuorescent spectra of UV—exposed samples (presented as back-
ground corrected spectra), with either of both S—MRS (Fig. 7c) and P-MRS (Fig. 8c) ana-
logues. However, the high ﬂuorescent background impaired the optimization of the signal-to-
noise ratio by increasing acquisition time or accumulations.

Figures 7 and 8 present the background corrected spectra and the images derived
from Raman scans of cells mixed with S-MRS and P-MRS analogues, respectively,
for the three conditions tested: control (A and D), exposure to simulated Martian
atmosphere (B and E) and all simulated Martian conditions (C and F). The coverage
of [3-carotene’s three main peaks was calculated by extracting the areas of appearance
from the Raman images generated by the 2500 scans and treated with the width ﬁlter
function of the WITec Project software. Due to the unequal distribution of the
ﬂuorescent background in UV exposed samples, classical ﬁlters such as peak area,
center of mass or intensity ﬁlters failed to represent an accurate coverage of the [3-
carotene signal contrary to the width ﬁlter. The resulting images, processed with the
threshold function of Adobe Photoshop, allowed for B-carotene coverage percentage
calculation (Figs. 7 and 8, D E F). The presence of the B-carotene bands (denoted by
the white areas) was veriﬁed for each position and the typical resulting spectra are
shown in Fig. 7d, e and f for S-MRS and Fig. 8d, e and f for P-MRS. This process
allowed us to conﬁrm the omnipresent coverage of the B-carotene bands for uneX-
posed samples, present in ~97 % of the image scan for S-MRS (Fig. 7d) and ~94 %
for P-MRS (Fig. 8d). Consistently with previous results, exposure to the simulated
Martian atmosphere did not impair B-carotene coverage, with values Virtually identical
to the unexposed samples for either S-MRS (~96 % coverage, Fig. 7e) or P-MRS
(~95 % coverage, Fig. 8e). Exposure to 570 MJ/m2 of polychromatic UV irradiation

in combination with simulated Martian atmosphere, however, dramatically decreased
B-carotene coverage in our samples where the values dropped down to ~2 % for S-
MRS (Fig. 7i) and ~5 % for P-MRS (Fig. 81). The three main peaks of B-carotene are
Visible with a slightly better signal-to-noise ratio on the spectrum of the P-MRS
sample (Fig. 8c) than on the spectrum of the S-MRS sample (Fig. 7c), probably
due to the lower ﬂuorescent background noted on the P-MRS average spectrum.
DNA Detection by PCR—based Assay and Survivability

The persistence of DNA in dried cells of Chroococcidiopsis sp. CCMEE 029 exposed to
Martian-sirnulated conditions was assessed by testing its suitability as template in a PCR-based
assay (Fig. 9). Positive ampliﬁcation of DNA from dried cells mixed with the two Martian
analogues was veriﬁed for unexposed controls (not shown), even though the composition of
the mineral matrix (especially clay containing minerals such as montrnorillonite in P-MRS; see
Table 1) is known to be problematic (Alvarez et al. 1998; Direito et al. 2012).

When dried cells without minerals were exposed to 570 kJ/ni2 of polychromatic UV
radiation (570 MJ/m2 with 0.1 % ND ﬁlter) combined with a simulated Martian atmosphere,
no PCR amplicons were yielded (lane 2). When cells mixed to S—MRS and P-MRS were
exposed to 570 MJ/m2 of polychromatic UV radiation (without ND ﬁlter), PCR ﬁngerprints
were obtained although with altered proﬁles (lanes 3—4) compared to PCR ﬁngerprints
obtained from the liquid control (lane 1). However, dried cells of Chroococcidiopsis sp.
CCMEE 029, mixed or not with P-MRS and S—MRS, lost their colony-forming ability when
exposed to polychromatic UV irradiation (with or without ND ﬁlter) in combination with a
simulated Martian atmosphere.

On the other hand, PCR proﬁles Virtually identical to the control (lane 1) were yielded when
dried cells were exposed to simulated Martian atmosphere (for 89 days) in the absence
(Fig. 9b, lane 2) or presence of S—MRS (lane 3) or P-MRS (lane 4) and was correlated by
the scoring of survivors, regardless of the presence of a mineral matrix.

Discussion

The BIOMEX experiment is aimed at exposing extremophiles and biomolecules to space and
Martian-like conditions in low Earth orbit, the latter being simulated in one of the trays of the
ESA EXPOSE-R2 facility containing a simulated Martian atmosphere. After ground-based
simulations, the detectability of biomarkers (photosynthetic pigments, [3-carotene and DNA)
was investigated in dried cells of Chroococcidiopsis sp. CCMEE 029 mixed or not with P-
MRS or S—MRS after exposure to 570 MJ/ni2 of polychromatic UV irradiation (combined with
a simulated Martian atmosphere), as expected in 1 year in LEO (Rabbow et al. 2012, 2014) or
383 sols on the Martian surface (Cockell et al. 2000; Schuerger et al. 2003).

Exposure to 570 MJ/m2 of polychromatic UV irradiation led to a strong reduction (1—4 %
of control values) of the emission spectrum of photosynthetic pigments in Chroococcidiopsis
sp. CCMEE 029 mixed with P-MRS or S-MRS. This pointed out that both the 4—5 cell layers
obtained when mixing with P-MRS, and the 2—3 cell layers obtained when mixing with S-
MRS, did not provide efﬁcient shielding against UV radiation. Consistently, when dried
monolayers of Chroococcidiopsis sp. CCMEE 029 were exposed to 72 KJ/ni2 of a Martian-
like UV ﬂux, the pigment autoﬂuorescence dropped to less than 5 % of controls (Cockell et al.

2005). Nevertheless, among cells mixed with P-MRS, pigment autoﬂuorescence was only
reduced to 60 % of control values. This might be a consequence of the thinner grain-size of P-
MRS that impaired the preparation of homogeneous samples, thus leading to thicker and
protected areas in the samples. Hence, although photosynthetic pigments are expected to
bleach when exposed on the Martian surface for a period as long as 383 sols, they might
retain their ﬂuorescence if sufﬁciently shielded with minerals.

In the present work, the reﬂectance of S—MRS and P-MRS minerals, when excited with a
543 -nm or a 488-nm laser, impaired the identiﬁcation of ﬂuorescent breakdown products of
the photosynthetic pigments. Indeed, photolytic destruction of photosynthetic pigments was
reported in Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803 exposed to UV and ionizing radiation, yielding
ﬂuorescent breakdown products with an emission peak at ~450 nm (Dartnell et al. 2011;
Dartnell and Patel 2013). An emission peak at 563 nm, probably due to chlorophyll
photolysis, occurred in unshielded Chroococcidiopsis sp. CCMEE 029 exposed to 800 MJ/
m2 of polychromatic UV irradiation. It was however absent from cells mixed with anortho-
site, a lunar mineral analogue, as shown by the lambda scan spectra obtained on mineral-free
areas to avoid mineral reﬂectance (Baque et al. 2014, MB personal communication). P-MRS
and S-MRS have autoﬂuorescence peaks at 620 and 660 nm and, although it was not
possible to obtain cell pigment spectra in mineral-free areas, the typical emission peaks of
phycocyanin, allophycocyanin and chlorophyll a in UV—eXposed Chroococcidiopsis were
detected.

Fluorescent signals were also reported for Martian relevant minerals when excited in the
UV (266 and 355 nm) and Visible (532 nm) regions. In particular, calcium perchlorate has a
strong ﬂuorescent peak at around 600 nm after 532 nm excitation (Smith et al. 2014b). Hence,
a more thorough analysis is needed to insure that Martian soil does not interfere with the
identiﬁcation of selected autoﬂuorescent molecules. This might be relevant when using the
foreseen instrumentation on-board the ESA/Roscosmos mission, for example the UV/Vis
camera ﬁlters or the VIS—NIR spectrometer Ma_Miss (Mars Multispectral Imager for Subsur-
face Studies) (De Angelis et al. 2014).

In the present study, the persistence of the [3-carotene signature in dried Chroococcidiopsis
was assessed by using a confocal Raman microscope with an excitation wavelength of
5 32 nm, as foreseen for the RLS instrument on-board the ExoMars rover. In unexposed cells,
[3-carotene spectrum and chlorophyll a ﬂuorescence were the dominant signals and remained
Virtually identical to controls after exposure to simulated Martian atmosphere. On the contrary,
after 570 MJ/ni2 of polychromatic UV irradiation, in cells mixed with S—MRS or P-MRS the
[3-carotene signal dropped to 2 and 5 % of control, respectively. The lowest [3-carotene amount
detected was about 4 pg/ug of sample (4 mg/kg), based on an estimation of the carotenoid
content in Chroococcidiopsis (0.1 pg/cell) and considering a homogeneous repartition of the
cells on the investigated areas (2.109 cells on 115 mmz).

In relevant Martian minerals the detection limits of pure [3-carotene were reported to go
down to 0.1 mg/kg in an evaporitic matrix with a 514.5 nm laser (Vitek et al. 2009a) and
1 mg/kg in halite with a 785 nm laser (Vitek et al. 2009a; Vandenabeele et al. 2012). Hence,
after the EXPOSE-R2 space mission in Chroococcidiopsis shielded with Martian regolith, a
lower [3-carotene amount might be detected. In fact, during the EXPOSE-E and EXPOSE-R
missions, the exposure to about 570 MJ/m2 of polychromatic UV 200—400 nm, resulted in the
failure of the Raman analyses to detect [3-carotene in epilithic cyanobacterial bioﬁlms (Cockell
et al. 2011) and in Chroococcidiopsis sp. CCMEE 029 layered on rocks, as opposite to UV-
shielded samples (Bryce et al. 2014).

UV irradiation is one of the main biological damaging factors encountered in space or on
the Martian surface. However, as Mars lacks an intrinsic magnetic ﬁeld (possibly lost, at least
3 .5 Gya ago), ionizing radiation of solar energetic protons (SEP), and galactic and solar cosmic
rays (GCRs and SCRs) reach today’s Martian surface and subsurface with high energies.
Curiosity reported a GCR dose rate of 76 mGy/year on the Martian surface and of 8.7 mGy/
year at 2 m under the surface (Hassler et al. 2013; Farley et al. 2014). This suggested that
although over geological time scales dormant microorganisms might be inactivated even at
depths between 1 and 2 m below the Martian surface, transient habitable conditions might
allow them to repair the accumulated damages (Dartnell et al. 2007; Hassler et al. 2013). This
data also gives clues on biosignature preservation over geological timescales, suggesting that
organic matter could be preserved in recently exposed rocks or soils (Ming et al. 2014), such as
mudstone at Gale crater’s surface (in situ radiometric measurements revealed its exposure time
of 78i30 million years (Farley et al. 2014)). In particular, gamma-rays were shown to
diminish [3-carotene Raman signal after 15 kGy and to destroy it after 150 kGy (Dartnell
et al. 2012). Therefore, Raman identiﬁcation of [3-carotene would be impaired after ~2 million
years on the Martian surface and after ~17 million years at 2 m under the surface, correspond-
ing to the foreseen ExoMars drill depth.

On the other hand, an ionizing radiation dose of 675.4 uGy/day (resulting from GCR,
energetic protons of the inner radiation belt and electrons from the outer radiation belt (DacheV
et al. 2014)) was recorded during the EXPOSE-R mission, hence the EXPOSE-R2 mission
will simulate an exposure of ~30 years (in a 12-month mission) to ~40 years (in an 18-month
mission) at a 2 m depth on Mars.

The observed reduction of the [3-carotene signal in thin layers of Chroococcidiopsis mixed
with the Martian regolith simulants after exposure to a UV dose simulating half a Martian year
on the Martian surface suggested that remains of carotenoid-containing life forms close to the
surface would quickly lose their Raman signature. On the contrary, under thicker UV—shielding
materials, Raman signature destruction is driven by the ionizing radiation environment and
could persist for several million years.

In our study, UV irradiation caused an augmentation in the mineral ﬂuorescence back-
ground, which was more pronounced in S—MRS but did not impair the [3-carotene identiﬁca-
tion in Chroococcidiopsis exposed to a dose corresponding to that received in 383 sols.
Nevertheless, it might have detrimental implications for the identiﬁcation of biomarkers and
mineral context on the highly UV irradiated Martian surface. Blue-green excitation is known to
induce a strong ﬂuorescent background in Raman spectra (Edwards et al. 2013), but a 532 nm
excitation, as foreseen for ExoMars’s RLS, enhances the Raman signal by producing a strong
resonance effect on [3-carotene molecules due to their conjugated C=C double bonds (e.g., Gill
et al. 1970; Marshall et al. 2007; Vitek et al. 2009b).

In order to evaluate the contribution of Martian regolith to the preservation of DNA in
dried Chroococcidiopsis cells exposed to polychromatic UV irradiation in combination
with a simulated Martian atmosphere, DNA detection was attempted by a PCR-based
assay. A dose of 570 kJ/m2 of polychromatic UV irradiation (570 MJ/m2 attenuated with
a 0.1 % ND ﬁlter) impaired the DNA detectability, whereas amplicons were yielded in
thin layer of cells (from 2—3 cell layers to 4—5 cell layers) mixed with P-MRS or S-MRS
and exposed to 570 MJ/m2 of polychromatic UV irradiation, simulating half a Martian
year. Consistently, the ampliﬁcability of DNA in Chroococcidiopsis sp. CCMEE 029
mixed with anorthosite and exposed to 800 MJ/m2 of polychromatic UV irradiation was
previously reported (Baque et al. 2014). On Earth, DNA was recovered from samples

between 400,000 years and 1.5 million years old (Paabo et a1. 2004; Sankaranarayanan
et a1. 2014); on Mars, DNA might remain detectable at least for several million years in
the presence of UV shielding regolith, and amid the extreme dryness and low temper-
atures (WillersleV et a1. 2004).

Even though the protection provided by P-MRS 0r S-MRS allowed biosignature
detection in Chroococcidiopsis exposed to Martian simulated conditions, no survivors
were scored after polychromatic UV radiation (570 MJ/mz); survivors were scored
only after a 3-month exposure to simulated Martian atmosphere regardless of the
mineral matrix. This lack of survival is in agreement with a scenario in which several
features might affect Chroococcidiopsis’s survival, including the thickness of cell
envelopes, the presence of UV shielding minerals, or the abundance of extracellular
polymeric substances (EPS) produced by bioﬁlms as opposite to planktonic cultures
(Baque et a1. 2014). In the present work, planktonic cultures were dried whi1e mixed
with minerals, the thickness not exceeding 15 um (corresponding to 4—5 cell layers).
This thickness did not guarantee the survival even of bottom layers cells when
exposed to 570 MJ/m2 0f polychromatic UV. It was previously reported that in
Chmococcidiopsis biofilms exposed to UVC radiation, damage occurred in the ﬁrst
3—4 cell layers and that dried biofilms better survived 570 kJ/ni2 0f polychromatic UV
radiation compared to dried planktonic multilayers (Baque et al. 2013a).

For the EXPOSE-R2 space mission, neutral density ﬁlters were applied to reduce the
received dose to 0.1 % 0f the total ﬂux, thus leading to an expected dose of 570 kJ/ni2 of
UV 200—400 nm for a 1-year mission. The reduced dose could simulate light conditions in
some natural hypolithic communities (Warren-Rhodes et a1. 2013; Smith et al. 2014a) 0r
evaporite communities below 2 mm of gypsum (Stromberg et a1. 2014). The mineral matrix
composition and thickness is moreover relevant when considering target Martian habitats
(Martinez-Frias et a1. 2006) because different rocks provide different UV shielding for
hypolithic communities (Smith et al. 2014a). A basalt dust (basalt is one of the main
components of Martian dust) with a thickness of ~300 um reduces a polychromatic UV ﬂux
to 0.1 % of its incident value (Caro et a1. 2006). However, their role in effectively protecting
potential biological remains and their consequent impact on biosignatures identiﬁcation has
been poorly studied and are among the investigated subjects of the BIOMEX experiment.

In conclusion, insights into the preservation potential of cyanobacterial
biosignatures in a Martian environment were obtained from Chmococcidiopsis eX-
posed to Martian simulations carried out in the frame of the BIOMEX space mission.
Polychromatic UV irradiation simulating 1 year in LEO or 383 sols 0n the Martian
surface (570 MJ/mz) differently impaired the detectability of the investigated
biosignatures. The B-carotene Raman signal was always detectable regardless of the
layer thickness of the cell mixed with regolith simulants (up to 15 um). Photosyn-
thetic pigments were strongly bleached in both 2—3 cell layers and in 4—5 cell layers,
whereas autoﬂuorescence could be detected in a few cells occurring in thicker layer
yielded when mixing the cells with the thinner-sized grains of P-MRS. DNA was a
suitable template for PCR amplification regardless of whether cells were mixed with
P-MRS 0r S-MRS, whereas it was not ampliﬁable in the absence of minerals. When
the analysis of the samples exposed to simulated Martian conditions outside the ISS
inside the EXPOSE-R2 facility will be carried out, new insights will be gathered on
the inﬂuence of all the space parameters on Chroococcidiopsis’s survival and preser-
vation of its cellular components.

"19","Preservation of Biomarkers from Cyanobacteria
In the present work, the radiation received within 383 sols 0n the Martian surface was
estimated using the average UV ﬂux of ~50 W/m2 predicted by previous models (Cockell et a1.
2000; Schuerger et a1. 2003). However, according to the latest Curiosity measurements, this is
probably an overestimation since the maximum UV irradiance (200—3 80 nm) recorded at
midday at Gale’s crater was ~20 W/m2 (Gémez—Elvira et a1. 2014). Hence the results inferred
from the Martian simulation during the EXPOSE-R2 space mission could suggest longer
preservation of potential bicsignatures on Mars. In addition, since the Martian analogues
showed a strong ﬂuorescence when investigated by Raman analysis, further investigation is
needed to ensure unambiguous biosignature detection in future Mars missions.
