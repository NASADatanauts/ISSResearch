"2","ABSTRACT
In this study, we have attempted to combine standard immunological assays with the cellular
' resolving power of the ﬂow cytometer to positively identify the specific cell types involved in
spaceﬂight-induced immune alterations. We have obtained whole blood samples from 27
~ astronauts collected at three timepoints (L-lO, R+0 and R+3) surrounding four recent space
shuttle missions. The duration of these missions ranged from 10 to 18 days. Assays performed
included serum/urine cortisoL comprehensive subset phenotyping, assessment of cellular
activation markers and intracellular cytokinc production following mitogenic stimulation.
Absolute levels of peripheral granulocytes were signiﬁcantly elevated following spaceﬂight, but
the levels of circulating lymphocytes and monocytes were unchanged. Lymphocyte subset analysis
demonstrated trends towards a decreased percentage of T cells and an increased percentage of B
cells. Nearly all of the astronauts exhibited an increased CD4:CD8 ratio, which was dramatic in
some individuals. Assessment of memory (CD45 RA+) vs. na'ive (CD45 RO+) CD4+ T cell
subsets was more ambiguous, with subjects tending to group more as a ﬂight crew. All subjects
from one mission-demonstrated an increased CD45RA:CD45RO ratio, while all subjects from
another mission demonstrated a decreased ratio. While no signiﬁcant trend was seen in the
monocyte population as deﬁned by scatter, a decreased percentage of the CD 14+ CD16+ V
monocyte subset was seen following spaceﬂight in all subjects tested. In general, most of the
cellular changes described above which were assessed at R+0 and compared to L- 10 trended to
pre-ﬂjght levels by R+3. Although no signiﬁcant differences were seen in the expression of the
cellular activation markers CD69 and CD25 following exposure to microgravity, signiﬁcant
alterations were seen in cytokine production in response to mitogenic activation for speciﬁc
subsets. T cell (CD3+) production of IL-2 was signiﬁcantly decreased after at R+0 as was IL-2
production by both CD4+ and CD8+ T cell subsets for most subjects. Production of IFN'Y did not
appear to be affected by microgravity exposure in either T cells in general or in the CD8+ T cell
subset. There was a spaceﬂight-induced decrease in IFNY production in the CD4+ T cell subset,
hoWever it did not reach statistical signiﬁcance. Serum and urine stress*hormone analysis
indicated signiﬁcant physiologic stresses in astronauts following spaceﬂight. In summary, these
results demonstrate alterations in the peripheral immune system of astronauts immediately after
spaceﬂight of 10 to 18 days duration and support continued research regarding microgravity and
immunology (including in-ﬂight sampling) prior to routine long-term spaceﬂight for astronauts.

"
"3","INTRODUCTION .

Dysregulation of the immune system has been a well-documented effect of human exposure to
a microgravity environment during spaceﬂight (1). Extensive ground based studies using
clinorotation cell culture, animal restraint unloading and human long term bed-rest have
demonstrated a variety of the effects of simulated microgravity on the immune system. These
effects have included altered cytokine production (2,3,4), reduced proliferative/activation
responses (5,6) and altered signal transduction pathways (5,7). In addition to these ground based
models, studies performed on subjects exposed to the space environment during and immediately
after landing have also demonstrated altered immune responses (8). These data have included
altered cytokine production (9,10,11) and altered distribution of peripheral immune cells (12,13).
Recent reports have documented immunological studies performed in-flight (14). When tested
during spaceﬂight, delayed type hypersensitivity was reduced, indicating a dysregulation of cell-
mediated immune function (15,16). The mechanisms which produce this dysregulation have not
been clearly established. In addition to the direct effects of microgravity on cellular physiology
other factors may also have influence. These may include radiation, changes in calcium usage in
the musculosystem and psychological issues such as stress. ‘

The production of cytokines plays a critical role in the ability of a host to mount an immune
response against an invading microorganism. In addition, the particular cells producing cytokines
and the Speciﬁc cytokines produces directly determine the type and magnitude and duration of the
immune response. It naturally follows that a decreased ability to produce cytokines can result in
potentially signiﬁcant immune alteration and a reduced ability to ﬁght infections.

In the [9903 the ability to detect cytokine production in individual positively identiﬁed cells by .
ﬂow cytometry was developed (17,18,19). Conventional assays to detect cytokine production
have several drawbacks. Bioassays are not necessarily cytokine-speciﬁc in that they measure

W functional properties. Supernatant cytokine protein can be readily measured by ELISA methods,
but unless a highly puriﬁed cell population was cultured this method does not identify the

_ population of cells responsible for the cytokine production (i.e.: PBMC’s). In addition, the results
of ELISA assays reﬂect the net outcome of produced, absorbed and degraded cytokine and do
not necessarily distinguish between biologically active and inactive substances. In situ
_ hybridization and RT-PCR detect cytokine gene expression and are highly sensitiye but they are
labor-intensive and the presence of cytokine RNA does not guarantee translation to cytokine
protein. The advantages of this ﬂow cytometric detection of cytokines are the detection of
cytokine protein, as opposed to cytokine RNA and the ability to examine the production of
cytokines by individual cell populations while still culturing mixed populations of cells (PBMCS)
to retain the various cechell interactions. The assessment of cytokine production has been shown
‘ to have great value in the research laboratory for investigating basic biological interactions

(20,21,22). Recently, ﬂow cytometric cytokine detection has been demonstrated to have
diagnostic value in clinical situations (23,24) and will conceivably enter into clinical use for the
rapid and routine monitoring of cytokine production and peripheral immune balance.

In this study, we have attempted to combine standard immunological assays with the cellular
resolving power of the ﬂow cytometer to positively identify the speciﬁc cell types involved in
microgravity induced immune dysregulation. Blood was collected from 27 astronauts
(representing four recent space shuttle missions) both before launch and at 2 points after landing.

‘ "" A comprehensive battery of standard immunological assays was performed. in addition to the .
‘ detection of cytokine responses by flow cytometry. Due to the limitations in available sampling

"
"4","for each ﬂight all assays were not performed on all shuttle ﬂights, however all assays were
performed on samples from at least two of the four shuttle ﬂights (intracellular cytokine
assessment was performed on three ﬂights). We found that the ability to produce IL—2 was
depressed after spaceﬂight, and that CD4+ and CD8+ T cell subsets seemed equally sensitive to
the effect. Regarding IFNY production, only the CD4+ T cell subset demonstrated decreased
production after spaceﬂight. lFN'y production by the CD8+ subset appeared largely unchanged.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Whole blood collection. Whole blood was collected from 27 healthy astronaut donors at three
timepoints surrounding space shuttle ﬂights. These subjecfs consist of the entire crew from four
separate shuttle missions, which varied in length from 10 to 18 days. Blood collection was
obtained 10 days prior to launch (L- 10), immediately after landing (R+0) and three days after
landing (L+3). The whole blood was collected into EDTA Vacutainer tubes (Becton Dickinson,
Mountain View, CA). Informed consent was obtained from all participants.
Hematology analysis. Standard clinical hematology analysis was performed according to the
manufacturers instructions on a Coulter MaxM hematology analyzer. Results obtained included a
standard complete blood count and WBC differential, including cell percentages and absolute
counts. '
Cell culture for activation. Four m1 of whole anticoagulated blood was diluted 1:1 with sterile
phosphate buffered saline (PBS) and subjected to centrifugation over a Ficoll-I-lypaque density
gradient (Pharmacia, Upsala Sweden) to isolate PBMC's. The isolated cells were washed 3 times
in sterile PBS and resuspended in RPMI medium 1640 (Gibco BRL, Grand Island, N Y)
<:-~‘-‘f containing 10% fetal bovine serum (GIBCO) and l x 105 mg/ml penicillin and streptomycin
(GIBCO). The ﬁnal concentration of cells was determined using a hemaCytometer. A ﬁnal
concentration ranging from 0.7—1.3 x 10‘5 cells/ml was used in all experiments. For intracellular
cytokine analysis cells were cultured in either medium containing 10 ng/ml PMA and 1 mg/ml
. ionomycin for 5 hours or medium containing 10 ug/ml with 5 ug/ml lipopolysaccharide E.coli
. strain 011:B4 (LPS; Sigma). In all cases 3 mM monensin (Sigma) was added to the PBMC
cultures to shut down extracellular transport of cytokines and allow intracellular accumulation.
. For assessment of the cell surface activation markers CD69 and CD25 in response to stimulus
isolated PBMC’s were cultured in medium containing 10 ug/ml PHA for 24 hours.
9; Surface marker staining. For WBC surface marker analysis 100 pl] of peripheral whole blood
. was stained along with the manufactures suggested amount of FLl:ﬂuorescein isothiocyanatc
(FITC), FL2zphycoerythrin (PE) or FL3zPeridinin Chlorophyll Protein (PercP) labeled monoclonal
_ antibodies in 100 1.11 of phOSphate buffered saline (PBS). The mixtures were incubated on ice for
15 minutes, 3 m1 of .85% ammonium chloride was added and the mixture was incubated in the .
dark for 5 minutes to lyse the RBC's, washed 3 times with 3 ml of PBS and resuspended in 0.5 ml
PBS with 1% parafonnaldehyde.
For the assessment of CD69 and CD25 the cells (activated in culture) were washed and
, resuspended in 500111 PBS to which the manufacturers suggested amount of labeled monoclonal
antibodies to CD69 and CD25 were added. Following incubation for 10 minutes the cells were .
washed and resuspended in 5001.11 of PBS containing 1.0% paraformaldehyde prior to analysis.

"
"5","Intracellular cytokine staining. An antibody conﬁguration was selected which assessed T cell
production of [FNY and IL-2 in T cells (including production from CD4+ and CD8+ T cell

‘ subsets) in response to PBMC stimulation with PMA and ionomycin. Surface markers were
stained ﬁrst by resuspending the cells in 200 ml of PBS to which [.0 mg of PerCP labeled mouse
monoclonal antibody to CD3, CD4vor CD8 was added, samples were incubated at RT. for 10
minutes and then washed with PBS. The PBMC's were then ﬁxed in 200 ml of 4.0%
paraformaldehyde in PBS for 10 minutes, then washed again in PBS. To detect intracellular
production of IFN‘Y or IL-2 in conjunction with a surface marker, ﬁxed PBMC's were resuspended
in 200 ml of permeabilization buffer (PB), consisting of 5.0% non-fat dry milk and 0.5% saponin
in PBS to which 0.5 mg of labeled mouse antibody to either IFNY or IL-2 was added. Cells were
incubated at room temperature for 25 minutes. The cells werethen washed in PBS containing
saponin (P888) and resuspended in 1.0% parafonnaldehyde for analysis.

To detect intracellular production of IL- la in conjunction with surface CD14 in monocytes,
the activated PBMC’s were resuspended in 200 ml of PBS to which 1.0 mg of FITC labeled
mouse monoclonal antibody to CD14 was added and incubated at RT. for 10 minutes. The
PBMC's were then washed in PBS and ﬁxed in 200 ml of 4.0% paraformaldehyde in PBS for 10
minutes, then washed again in PBS. To detect intracellular IL-ltx, the ﬁxed PBMC's were
resuspended in 200 ml of PB with 0.5 mg of a PE labeled antibody to IL- 1a (Pharmingen),
incubated for 25 minutes at RT. and washed with P888. The cells were then resuspended in
[.0% paraformaldehyde for analysis.

Flow cytometry analysis. For 'analysis, a Coulter XL ﬂow cytometer was conﬁgured with
appropriate electronic compensation for spectral overlap of the light emitted by the different
ﬂuorochromes. The lymphocyte cluster was identiﬁed by plotting forward versus side (90°) light
scatter. The lymphoid cells were then ’gated’ for immunoﬂuorescence analysis, including only the
i"" lymphoid cells in the data analysis. Thresholds for positive were set using isotype matched
control antibodies. Sample analysis was performed using System 2 software on a Coulter-XL ﬂow
cytometer
Serum and urine stress hormone measurement. Analysis of Serum and 24-hour urine were
4 performed using commerciallyavailable kits according to the manufacturer’s instructions. .
Serum/urine cortisol were performed by RIA (DiaSorin, Stillwater, MN); urine aldosterone was
1:3 ‘ performed by RIA (Diagnostic Product Corporation, Los Angeles, CA); urine ADH was
perfomed by RIA (Diagnostic Systems Laboratories, Inc., Webster, TX); urine
epinephrine/norepinephrine were performed by RIA (ALPCO, Windham, NH). .
. Statistical analysis. To test the signiﬁcance of differences observed as a result of exposure to
microgravity either a one way repeated measures analysis of variance (three groups) or a paired T
test (two groups) was performed. The results obtained from preflight (L-IO) testing were
compared to the results obtained from landing day (R+0) testing. Statistical signiﬁcance was '
deﬁned by P<0.05 and differences which achieved signiﬁcance are indicated as such in the ﬁgures.

"
"6","RESULTS
White Blood Cell Differential. The data were consistent with signiﬁcant alterations in the
status of the peripheral immune system upon landing. An analysis of relative percentages of
granulocytes, lymphocytes and monocytes from all four shuttle ﬂights indicated a statistically
signiﬁcant increase in the percentage of peripheral blood granulocytes, which was accompanied by
a corresponding signiﬁcant decrease in the relative percentage of peripheral blood lymphocytes
(data not shown). Considering that the percentages of WBC subsets are relative with respect to
each other, an analysis of absolute peripheral blood cell counts was performed. Absolute levels of
peripheral granulocytes were signiﬁcantly elevated following spaceﬂight, but the levels of
circulating lymphocytes and monocytes were unchanged (Fig. 1). These data indicate that the
differences in circulating granulocytes had artiﬁcially skewed thelymphocyte percentage data.

I After three days of exposure to unit gravity, the percentages in most of the subjects had returned
to near baseline. N 0 signiﬁcant alterations regarding levels of circulating monocytes were seen
following spaceﬂight (Fig. 1).

Surface Marker Subset Analysis. Lymphocyte subset analysis demo nstrated a signiﬁcantly
decreased percentage of T cells (CD3+) in 10 of 13 subjects (P<0.05, Fig. 23) and a slightly
increased percentage of B cells (CD19+) in 9 of 13 subjects (Fig. 2b). No real trend was seen in
the percentage of N K cells (CDl6/56+; Fig. 2c). Nearly all (23 of 27) astronauts had an increased
CD4:CD8 ratio, which was dramatic in some individuals-(P<0.05, Fig. 2d). For the majority of
the subjects with an increased CD4:CD8 ratio at R+l, the ratios returned to near baseline (L—lO)
values within three days after landing (R+3). Assessment of memory (CD45RA+) vs. na’ive
(CD45RO+) CD4+ T cell subsets was more ambiguous, with subjects tending to group as a ﬂight
crew. All subjects from one mission (7 of 7) demonstrated an increased CD45RA2CD4SRO ratio,
while all subjects from another mission (5 of 5) demonstrated a decreased ratio (Fig. 2e).

“e.- Subjects from a third mission exhibiteded no signiﬁcant trend. The reason for this grouping is
unclear. While no signiﬁcant trend was seen in the monocyte population as de’fmed by scatter, a
signiﬁcant decrease in the percentage of CD14+ CD16+ monocyte subset was seen in all subjects
tested (P<0.0S, Fig. 2f). All of the cellular changes described above which were assessed at R+O
trended to pre-ﬂight levelsby R+3.

Expression of Cellular Activation Markers. Isolated PBMC’s from astronaut whole blood
samples were cultUred in the presence of 10 ug/ml PHA for 24 hours to assess the capacity of the
cells to respond to a mitogenic signal. Under normal conditions, the expression of CD69 occurs
early during lymphocyte activation, and the expression of CD25 occurs somewhat later during the
activation process. No signiﬁcant diﬂ‘erences were seen in the expression of the cellular activation
markers CD69 and CD25 following activation in culture for 24 hours at either R+0 or R+3 as
compared to L~10 preﬂight samples (data not shown). ' .
Intracellular Cytokine Detection by Flow Cytometry. Signiﬁcant alterations in cytokinc
production by speciﬁc lymphocyte subsets in response to mitogenic activation were detected by
flow cytometry. Representative ﬂow cytometry scatter plots demonstrating decreased production

_ of [FNY and [L-Zafter spaceﬂight (R+0), as compared to preﬂight (L-lO) and a three day
recovery after ﬂight (R+3) fer one astronaut are presented in ﬁgure 3. The mean percentages of
cytokine producing cells for all timepoints were determined and are presented in ﬁgure 4. In the '
grouped subjects, the data indicate a suppression in the ability of stimulated T cells (CD3+) to

"
"7","produce [L—2 after spaceﬂight. T cell production of [FNy was not affected. When cytokine
production by the individual T cell subsets (CD4+ and CDS+) was examined,
the suppression of IL—2 production was evident in both the CD4 and the CD8 T cell subsets
(ﬁgure 4). In contrast, IFNY production was reduced in the CD4+ T cell subset while CD8+ T
cell production of IFN‘Y appeared to be unchanged.
- To examine the subjects individually, the cytokine production data for the astronauts at L- 10
was normalized to 100% (Fig. 5). Thus, the relative increases or decreases at R+0 may be
visualized for all subjects while maintaining the ability to look at individual data points. T cell
(CD3+) production of IL—2 was decreased after at R+0 in all subjects assayed (7 of 7; Fig. 53).
In these same subjects, however, no trend emerged regarding the T cell expression of IFN'Y (Fig.
5d). Speciﬁc T cell subset (CD4 vs. CD8) cytokine production was assessed for a larger
p0pulation of astronauts. It was found that the ability to produce IL-2 in response to mitogenic
stimulus was depressed for both the CD4+ subset (11 of 12 subjects; Fig 5b) and for the CD8+
subset ( 18 of 20 subjects; Fig 5c).
Generalized T cell (CD3+) production of IFN'Y was altered, although this assay was performed
on only one mission with a sample size of seven. The production of IFNY by speciﬁc T cell
subsets was investigated on a larger sample size Spanning three missions. When T cell production
of IFNy was assessed in the context of CD4+ and CD8+ subsets, the CD4+ T cell subset appeared
to be more sensitive to the effects of spaceﬂight. The majority of astronauts tested demonstrated a
decrease in production (10 of 12; p<0.05; F ig. 5e) of IFNy. The production of IFNY by CD8+ T
cells was effected by spaceﬂight as no clear trend emerged (Fig. SD.
The ability of monocytes to produce IL-la in response to mitogenic stimulus was also
assessed. No dramatic alterations and no clear trends emerged for the majority of the subjects (14
of 20; data not shown), however for a small number of subjects (6 of 20) a dramatic increase in
IL-la production was seen at R+0. For these subjects these re3ponses trended towards L—10
... levels by R+3. This population represented the entire crew for one space shuttle ﬂight out of the
"" three ﬂights for which this assay was performed. A comparison of the mean percentage of IL-la
producing monocytes for L-lO and R+O indicated the increase in production was statistically ,
significant (p<0.05). '
Serum and urine chemistries. Serum and urine stress hormone analysis was performed on
subjects both pre-ﬂight and immediately post-ﬂight to investigate the physiologic stress resulting .
from spaceﬂight/landing. Serum cortisol and ACTH, as well as urine cortisol, aldosterone, ADH,
epinipherine and norepinepherinc were assessed. All mean measurements were elevated post- ,
ﬂight, as compared to preﬂight values (Fig. 6). The'elevations for urine cortisol, aldosterone and
norepinepherine achieved statistical signiﬁcance (P<0.05, Fig .6). These results indicate that the
astronaut subjects were subjected to signiﬁcant physical stresses during, or immediately following
spaceﬂight. . » ,

"8","DISCUSSION
The dysregulation of the immune system is a well-documented result of prolonged exposure to
microgravity. Several studies have identiﬁed altered cytokine production proﬁles in subjects
exposed to microgravity for prolonged periods (9,10,11). In addition, ground based studies have '
also indicated that simulated microgravity also results in a depressed immune response and
reduced capacity to produce speciﬁc cytokines (2,3,4,S,6,7). -
Here we confirm the ﬁndings of others regarding alterations in the peripheral blood immune
cell subsets. In particular, we demonstrate an increase in the percentage of peripheral blood
granulocytes and a decrease in percentages of lymphocytes immediately following spaceﬂight.
This is consistent with the results seen by Stowe, et al who recently reported on neutrophil
_ percentages and function following spaceﬂight (25). Since the [Tércentages of WBC subsets are
relative with respect to each other, an analysis of absolute peripheral blood cell counts was
performed. Absolute levels of peripheral granulocytes were signiﬁcantly elevated following
spaceflight and the absolute levels of lymphocytes and monocytes were unchanged (Fig. 1).
These data indicate that the differences in circulating granulocytes had artiﬁcially skewed the
lymphocyte percentage data. Regarding speciﬁc lymphocyte subsets, we report here that the T
cell CD4:CD8 subset ratio increasedfollowing spaceflight. It is likely that this resnlt would be
‘ attributed to decreased levels of CD8+ T cells, as opposed to increased levels of CD4+ T cells,
given the overall decrease in the levels of total T cells. These results will require continuation in
the future on a larger sample size and perhaps using recently developed methods to directly
quantify absolute counts during ﬂow cytometry analysis. No signiﬁcant trends emerged regarding
levels of B cells and N K cells following spaceﬂight in our study. In addition, ratios of memory
(CD45RO+) to naive (CD45RA+) T cells did not demonstrate signiﬁcant trends in our study.
This was not unexpected, as the duration of these ﬂights was probably not long enough to result
in a broad eXpansion of memory cells, and since no signiﬁcant lengthy illnesses were reported
m: during these four shuttle ﬂights. No alterations in monocyte levels were detected when analyzing
by scatter properties alone. The recently described subset of CDl4+/CD 16+ peripheral blood
monocytes was also assessed in this study. This unique subset, functionally appearing like tissue
macrophages, has recently been identiﬁed and associated with Speciﬁc disease processes (26,27).
This subset comprises approximately 10% of the total peripheral blood monocyte populatio [1.
Our preﬂight CD [4+ CD 16+ monocyte values correlated well with that value, and a signiﬁcant
- decrease was observed postﬂight. Values rebounded to levels at or above the preﬂight value by
' R+3. Although the clinical signiﬁcance of this ﬁnding is unknown, this subset has been reported
to be proinflammatory in nature. Levels were reported to be decrease in subjects after extreme
exercise (26). This decreasemay be an acute response to the physical stresses of landing. In-
ﬂight measures will be required to further investigate the role of these cells in spaceﬂight immune
responses. » A
In this study we have identiﬁed speciﬁc subpopulations of immune cells which demonstrate
alterations in their ability to produce cytokines. This was accomplished by utilizing ﬂow
cytometry, with which cytokines and surface markers can be stained simultaneously, resulting in
positive identification of cytokine producing cells. This technology was used to positively identify
the particular subsets of T cells susceptible to spaceﬂight-induced cytokine (IFNy and [L-2)
dysregulation. We report here that the ability of T cells to produce IL-2 was depressed in the
' ' total T cell population, as well as in both the CD4+ subset and the CD8+ subset. This alteration
' was Statistically signiﬁcant for all three populations, and results trended towards preﬂight values
in the R+3 SpCClanS. This indicates that a recovery in IL-2 responsiveness was occurring several I 5

"
"9","days after landing. An interesting differentiation in the effects of spaceﬂight was observed for the
T cell subsets regarding the production of IFNy. While total T cell production of IFN‘Y was not
effected in a signiﬁcant fashion (although tested in a notably small sample size), the CD4+ subset
did demonstrate asigniﬁcant reduction in IFNY production. This effect was not observed in the
CD8+ subset. Although the individualized data plot for CD4+IIFNY production reveals 5 of 20
astronauts with increased production after spaceflight, statistical analysis of the entire population
demonstrated a signiﬁcant reduction overall (with 15 of 20 astronauts demonstrating a reduction

_ for this subset). In the context of the increased CD4zCDS ratio demonstrated earlier, it is possible
that the bias of the peripheral blood CD4+ T cell population is being shifted away from IFNY
production. Future studies investigating this phenomenon should include a comprehensive study
the effect of microgravity on the Thl/Th2 cytokine balance. Further testing with increased sample
size is clearly indicated to conﬁrm these results. This data suggest that the eﬂects of spaceﬂight
on cytokine production may dzﬁer for both the individual cytokines and also for diﬂ'erent cell
subsets responsible for cytokine production.

It should be noted that assessments of biological activity, such as the ones conducted in this
paper, on astronauts returning from spaceﬂight can be skewed by the psychological and
physiological stresses of landing and readaptation to unit gravity. The serum and urine stress
hormone results reported here indicate that subjects returning from spaceﬂight have been exposed
to signiﬁcant physical stress. The only way to overcome this potential shortcoming is to perform
testing during spaceﬂight. Unfortunately, the technical limitation of experimentation in spaceﬂight
has precluded performing many sophisticated laboratory analyses in the space environment. The
deveIOpment of newer innovative biological spaceﬂight-compatible hardware for performing
routine immunologic monitoring may overcome some of these problems (28, 29).

As increased numbers of humans will be subjected to spaceﬂight of increasing duration, the
dysregulation of the human immune system in microgravity is becoming a great concern to the
spaceﬂight medical community. This is especially true as NASA and other space agencies prepare

-‘ for lengthy missions to Mars. Thorough investigation of the effects of spaceﬂight on the human
immune system may result in the development of effective countermeasures either via
pharmacology or thro ugh manipulation of the spaceﬂight environment (to. artiﬁcial gravity, or
other mechanisms). It is expected that the International Space Station will serve as an excellent
platform to further extend research into the immunology effects on human physiology, as well as
other related biological sciences. This data would then enhance our ability to develop required

l countermeasures and ensure the health and safety of future long-duration spaceﬂight crew
members. _
