The Vane Gap Capillary Flow Experiments are part of a suite of low-g experiments
ﬂown onboard the International Space Station to observe critical wetting phenomena in
‘large length scale’ capillary systems. The Vane Gap geometry consists of a right cylinder
with elliptic cross-section and a single central vane that does not contact the container
walls. The vane is slightly asymmetric so that two gaps between the vane and container
wall are not of the same size. In this study, we identify the critical wetting conditions of this
geometry using the Concus-Finn method for both perfectly and partially wetting ﬂuids as
a function of container asymmetry. In a cylindrical container in zero-g, single—valued ﬁnite
height equilibrium capillary surfaces fail to exist if a critical wetting condition is satisﬁed.
This nonexistence results in signiﬁcant redistribution of the ﬂuids in the container. It will
be shown that there could be three critical geometric wetting conditions that include one
in each gap region and one for a global shift of bulk ﬂuid which, among the three, is the
most signiﬁcant.
I. Introduction and Background
I ”XPERIMENTS aboard the International Space Station (188) provide a Clear picture of the extent to
Which liquid behavior aboard spacecraft can be controlled by wetting and container geometry. The
experiments are referred to as the ‘Vane—Gap’ (VG) experiments and are part of a more general set of simple
handheld Capillary Flow Experimentsl(CFE) designed and developed at the NASA’S Glenn Research Center
for conduct on 188. The CFE—VG experiments Clearly illustrate the sensitivity of a capillary ﬂuid surface
to container shape and how small Changes to said shape may result in global shifts of the ﬂuids Within the
container. Understanding such behaviors is key to the passive management of liquids aboard spacecraft and
in certain cases permits us the ability to move large quantities (potentially tons!) of liquid by a simple Choice
of container shape. In other words, in the absence of signiﬁcant gravity the container geometry can act as
a pump to position the ﬂuid in a desirable location Within the container (i.e. liquid fuel over the fuel exit
port).

The CFE—VG experiments are the latest of a line of experiments performed in low—g environments and
sponsored in part by NASA to observe critical corner wetting phenomena in ‘large length scale’ capillary
systemsﬂi4 Mathematicians Concus and Finn5 were perhaps ﬁrst to construct the mathematical foundations
of the critical interior corner wetting condition that, if satisﬁed, spontaneously draws the liquid into and
along the corner to an impressive extent, and at known rates.6 Such critical wetting conditions dictate the
design of systems seeking to exploit the passive pumping capacity of the interior corner geometry. Critical
wetting conditions also dictate how to design system in Which the goal is to maintain liquid in one location.

Adding geometric complexity introduces signiﬁcant complexity to the critical geometric wetting criteria.
For example, an intricate geometric wetting condition arises for interior corners that do not actually contact.

wall, as studied by Chen and Collieott.7 The CFE-Vane Gap experiments are devised to investigate such
phenomena and provide a benchmark to both conﬁrm and guide methods of design for systems of increased
complexity.

360O Clockwise (CW) and counter-Cloekwise (CCW) varying the angle between the vane and the wall and
consequently the size of the vane-Wall gaps. The vane is also slightly asymmetric so that two gaps can be
tested for each container. TWO wetting conditions are studied between two Vane Gap containers (VG-l With
”y = 00 and VG-Z With 7 = 550).

The vane angle oz is deﬁned as the smallest angle between the vane and the major axis of the ellipse. At a
critical vane angle the ﬂuid Wicks up along the small gap and corner forming a slender column over the entire
extent of the vane. The ﬂuid also Wicks up the large gap corner With a further increase of the vane angle.
Note that in between the small and large gap wetting there is another critical wetting condition resulting in
a bulk shift of ﬂuid from right to left side of the vane as shown in the 4th and 5th image in the top row of
ﬁgure 2. This bulk shift is signiﬁcant because of the amount of ﬂuid involved. It is observed that the bulk
shift takes place between the small and large gap Wicking When the small gap is in quadrant 1—3. However,
for the small gap in quadrant 4 it is found that the bulk shift takes place before the Wicking in the two
gaps takes place, as shown in ﬁgure 3, in Which it can be seen that the ﬂuid shifts from let to right. The
critical vane angles for the small gap in different quadrants are listed in table 1. The data shows that there
is asymmetry present in the geometry.

It is interesting to note that the bulk shift is not observed in the preliminary Surface Evolver computations
as shown in the bottom row of ﬁgure 2. The computations assume perfect geometry Which is apparently
not true With the experiment vessels Where ﬁnite tolerance of fabrication, however small, is present. This
suggests that tiny asymmetries in fabrication result in signiﬁcant differences in the behavior of the ﬂuid
interfaces.

Critical vane angles for CFE VG—Z are listed in table 2. For the VG—Z only small and large gap Wickings
are observed throughout the entire range of the vane angle. Note that a vane angle range is provided in each
quadrant for wetting and de—wetting cases. The range is substantially larger as compared to that of CFE
VG—l. It is believed that this is caused by contact angle hysteresis. In the experiments, it is observed that
the movement of the meniscus tip in the gap is relatively slow and ‘stick—slip’. It often resumes advancing
When the vane angle is increased. In addition, due to the contact angle difference, the cross—sectional area
of the wetting liquid column in the gap region is smaller than that of CFE VG—l. A sample image is shown
in ﬁgure 4.

The critical vane angles for both the wetting and de—wetting are provided in table 1 and 2. De—wetting
takes place When the vane is rotated from the position aligning With the short aXis towards that aligning
With the long axis of the ellipse. The critical vane angle for the de—wetting is lower than that for the wetting.
It is believed that this is caused by the contact angle hysteresis due to the pinning edges of the vane.

In the remainder of this paper, the various critical wetting conditions are identiﬁed theoretically following

the ﬂuid in the container, either covering the base, or along a particular wall leaving a portion of the base
uncovered. In addition to the vane angle and ﬂuid wetting properties (for ideal sharp corners) the critical
geometric wetting conditions for the Vane Gap vessels depend on the speciﬁc vane gap, vane thickness,
ellipse size and shape as shown by analysis. The results are then compared to experiments. Exploiting such
phenomena, ﬂuids may be positioned as desired by simply and slightly Changing the geometry of container.
Conversely, knowledge of such critical geometric wetting behavior might avoid mishaps. For example, a
slight but uncontrolled container asymmetry might lead to a highly unfavorable shift in ﬂuid preventing
or limiting system function. As a result, the ISS CFE—Vane Gap experiments help provide a means for
specifying container tolerance.

II. Analysis
ILA. Concus-Finn Method
The analytic method described below identiﬁes the existence of equilibrium surfaces in any cylindrical con—
tainer. To avoid confusion, the equilibrium surface refers to a ﬂnite—height single—valued ﬂuid surface that
covers the base of the container, see ﬁgure 5. Note that there is only one simply connected contact line on
each simply connected solid wall boundary for such equilibrium ﬂuid conﬁgurations. This type of equilibrium
surface is called a simple surface. In a generic cylindrical container as shown in ﬁgure 5, such equilibrium
simple surfaces in general eXist in terrestrial conditions Where gravity overwhelms the capillary force. In
zero gravity, however, the existence of such a surface can not always be guaranteed. Nevertheless, a surface
‘non—eXistence’ is desirable in many applications as it provides a passive means to transport and/or locate
ﬂuids. The non—eXistence of a simple surface means that there is always a curvature gradient along the free
surface such that part of the interface rises to inﬁnity While the bulk surface remains one of constant mean
curvature given that there is enough liquid to cover the base of the container. Such a situation is not likely to
take place in practice. In reality, What happens is that the ﬂuid Wicks along part of the container wall With
relatively high curvature until it either reaches the top of the container or part of the base of the container is
exposed. Of course, the ﬂuid surface Will ultimately possess some equilibrium shape in a container of ﬁnite
size. Such equilibrium surfaces are different from simple surfaces and are called complex surfaces. In general,

"5","complex surfaces may either have multiple disconnected contact lines on every simply connected solid wall
or have portions of contact lines pinned along edges of the boundary walls. Essentially, the Concus—Finn
method predicts the transition from a simple surface to a complex one in a cylindrical container of ﬁnite
extent.

A necessary condition for the existence of a simple surface in a cylindrical container is established by
Concus and Finn. The derivation of the condition is only outlined here. A complete presentation can be
found in Finn10 and references contained therein. For a general cross section shown in ﬁgure 6, S2 represents
both the entire domain and its area and 2 represents the entire boundary of S2 and its length. In the domain
S2 one can draw arcs F of radius

than or equal to v. The angle of the corner A measured inside of S2 is greater than 1800 and is called a
reentrant corner. The angle at Which F meets A is dictated by Gibbs’s inequality

Where v is the equilibrium contact angle, ﬂ is the angle at Which the free surface meets the edge of the corner

A natural question following the non—eXistence 0f the simple equilibrium surface is What Will happen to
the ﬂuid surface. Finn and Neel11 point out that there is a solution surface in a singular sense, called a
Cylindrically singular solution, referred to as C—singular solution. Typically, there is a subdomain $20 as
shown in ﬁgure 8 over Which the free surface has constant mean curvature; the surface meets the solid wall

F0 With radius of curvature R0. In other words, the surface rises to inﬁnity for any approach to F0 from
Within {20. Over the subdomain S2 — $20, the interface rises to inﬁnity. Arc F0 serves as a barrier between the
subdornain $20 over Which the simple surface exists and the subdomain S2 — $20 over Which the simple surface
fails to exist. Note that When (I) = 0, the radius of curvature R0 = R7. However, for cases Where (I) < 0 the
radius of curvature R0 > R7 and R0 is determined by integrating the Young—Laplace—Gauss equation
over $20 and applying divergence theorem to obtain

F0 + (cos @230 — ZHOSZO = 0. (8)
Solving Eq.(8) gives rise to R0.
ILC. Analysis: Perfectly Wetting Case (CFE VG-l)
For the perfectly wetting case Where the contact angle is zero, it can be shown that there are at least four {2*
conﬁgurations as shown in ﬁgure 9. For each conﬁguration two arcs F are necessary With various portions
of the solid boundary to enclose a subdomain {2* and evaluate CI). Note that the four corners of the vane
are all reentrant as sketched in ﬁgure 6. Based on the vane angle, are P either meets the vane surface at
contact angle v, or it can meet the vane corner at any angle Within the range speciﬁed by Eq.(5). Arc F in
the former case is called regular While the latter is called irregular. With the vane centerline aligned With the
center of the ellipse and When all arcs F are regular, Pa and PC, and Pb and Pd are antisymmetric about the
axes of the ellipse. Otherwise, for certain vane angles, Pa and PC are not antisymmetric (i.e. not the same)
and must be determined independently; Pb is regular for the entire range of the vane angle so Pd does not
need to be identiﬁed independently. Furthermore, When both Pa and PC are regular, it can be shown that (I)
has the same value for cases 3 and 4.

mentioned above, arcs F0 can be identiﬁed that separate the small gap region from the rest of the domain
in the sense that the surface rises to inﬁnity over the small gap region While remaining a simple surface of
constant mean curvature in the rest of the domain. With further increases of the vane angle oz, the question
remains Whether there is always a simple solution over the rest of the problem domain. Since F0 serves as
a barrier between the small gap region and the rest of the domain it is necessary to subtract the small gap
region {21 from the entire domain 9 in order to analyze the rest of the domain. The approach employed
here is as follows. For each vane angle oz one needs to ﬁrst locate F0 Whose radius R0 satisﬁes Eq.(8) as
shown in ﬁgure 11a. Subsequently, the small gap region included on the convex side of the arcs F03 and
F010 is subtracted giving rise to a new modiﬁed domain shown in ﬁgure 11b. In the new domain, one draws

in the large gap region. Interestingly, experiments show that the bulk shift takes place at vane angles below

To compare the analytical and experimental results critical vane angles in different quadrants for the
small gap, large gap, and bulk shift are listed in table 1. A comparison of theoretical predictions and the
experimental results is shown in ﬁgure 14, Which reveals that the critical vane angle differs from quadrant t0
quadrant. The bulk shift takes place between the small gap and large gap wetting When the small gap is in
quadrant 1, 2, and 3, While it takes place before either gap wetting When the small gap is in quadrant 4. The
difference is apparently caused by the asymmetry in the geometry currently presumed Within the speciﬁed
tolerance of fabrication. The asymmetry could mean that the gap size is not exact 01‘ the vane is somehow
misaligned such that the vane center—line does not exactly pass through the center of the ellipse. The
experiment also shows that the bulk shift always takes place at the same side of the vane for both Clockwise
and counter—Clockwise operation of the vane, Which further suggests that there are geometric asymmetries.

It is also remotely possible that asymmetry of the ellipse contributes to the difference observed. A detailed
inspection of the test cell is not possible at present. However, a preliminary investigation of the gap size and
misalignment of the vane is carried out analytically below.

It can be shown that if there is any misalignment of the vane then (134 7E (133 such that CI) of the three

be shown that at 01 = 480 in quadrant 1 in order for the bulk shift to take place one should have )1 = 1.277

Figure 17. Modiﬁed domain for the vane in the quadrant 4 Where the bulk shift takes place ﬁrst

It is necessary to point out that What happens in quadrant 4 is very interesting because the bulk shift
takes place ﬁrst at 01 = 42.50. A detailed analysis shows that in order for this to happen, it is necessary to
have )1 = 0.541 While H is held constant. The effect of H is found to be negligible. Once there is a bulk
shift, corresponding C—singular solutions exist. Note that even though there are C—singular solutions and the
ﬂuid on one side of the vane would rise to inﬁnity, the free surface on this side of the vane still has certain
constant mean curvature. This means that it is still possible to analyze this part of the free surface for
the critical wetting condition. The modiﬁed domain is shown in ﬁgure 17b. In a sense, this is the opposite

critical wetting in the gap regions can be analyzed in the modiﬁed domain as shown in ﬁgure 17C and d. By
keeping A = 0.541, it is found that H = 0.971 in order for the wetting to take place in the small gap region
at oz 2 46.50. This gives the offset of the vane rotation center relative to the ellipse center. Based on this
offset, for the other quadrants, the critical vane angles are computed and compared in ﬁgure 18. Agreement
in quadrant 2 and 3 is not as good as that in quadrant 1 and 4. Obviously the determination of the vane
rotation center is not the only explanation. Further analysis and / or test cell measurements are necessary to
fully identify the cause.

Note that once there is Wicking in both the small and large gaps, the C—singular solutions in the two
regions have the same radius of curvature. The free surface between the two C—singular solutions has constant
mean curvature Which is actually greater than the curvature of the free surface on the other side of the vane.
As a result, the bulk shift oo—eXists With the Wicking in the two gap regions. This also implies that the arcs
F on the two sides of each gap actually have different radii of curvature. This is different from cases Where
there is no misalignment of the vane for Which the radii of curvature should always be same.

II.D. Analysis: Partially Wetting Case (CFE VG-2)
CFE VG—2 test cell examines a partially wetting case. The interior surface is coated such that the effective
contact angle of the test ﬂuid is around 550. Except for the thickness of the vane Which is twice that of the
vane in the CFE VG—l test cell, all other dimensions are the same for VG—l anol VG—2.

The critical wetting conditions are found in the same manner as that for the perfectly wetting case. It
can be shown that for any given vane angle arcs F of both regular and irregular types exist. However, only
the irregular type yields critical wetting conditions Where the functional (1) vanishes at certain vane angles
oz. It is found that the small gap wetting takes place at oz : 53.47O Whereas the large gap wetting takes
place at oz 2 62.290, Which compares suitably With the experimentally determined angles 470 g ozcr g 620
and 660 g ozcr g 790, respectively. The experimental results are listed in table 2. A comparison between the
analysis and the experiment is shown in ﬁgure 19. The difference between the average experimental value and
the prediction is 4.8% for the small gap wetting While it is 14.2% for the large gap wetting. It is speculated
that both geometric asymmetry and contact angle hysteresis could play a role causing the difference and this
shall be Clariﬁed once detailed measurements of the test cells is available. A bulk shift is not observed in the
experiment Which can be shown to be possible only When there is substantial misalignment of the vane.

III. Conclusions

Critical capillary wetting phenomena can be observed in many situations. It has important applications

in fuel systems, ﬂuids handling, and material processing in the liquid state on spacecraft. To fully understand

it provides important and useful means to perform operations more efﬁciently. In this work a Vane Gap
geometry is studied as part of the Capillary Flow Experiments conducted onboard the International Space
Station. This geometric conﬁguration features typical critical wetting phenomena that can be analyzed
using the Concus—Finn method. The geometry is relatively simple While the phenomena observed through
experiments and its analysis is rich.

In general, it is observed that there are three wetting conﬁgurations for the perfectly wetting ﬂuid in
CFE VG—l test cell. Those are the small gap wetting, the large gap wetting, and the bulk shift. Among the
three the bulk shift is most signiﬁcant because of the amount of the liquid involved. Analysis shows that the
bulk shift is not likely to happen if there is perfect symmetry. It also shows that fractions of a millimeter
0f misalignment of the vane can cause the bulk shift to take place revealing the geometric sensitivity of the
critical wetting. In contrast, only the small gap wetting and large gap wetting are observed for the partially
wetting ﬂuid in CFE VG—2 test cell. 13qu shift is unlikely unless there is substantial vane misalignment or
the contact angle is small enough With relatively small misalignment.
