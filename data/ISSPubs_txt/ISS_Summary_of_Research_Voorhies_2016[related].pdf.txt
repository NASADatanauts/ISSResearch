9 Abstract
10 Astronauts Will face a host of challenges on long-duration space missions like a human
11 expedition to Mars, including the difficulty of maintaining a balanced and healthy
12 microbiome. The human microbiome is the collection of all microorganisms residing in and 011 a
13 human host, and it plays an essential role in keeping humans healthy. However, imbalances in
14 the microbiome have also been linked to many human diseases. Space travel has been shown to
15 alter the microbiome of astronauts in ways that are not yet completely understood. Here we
16 review past and current microbiology and microbiome research With the aim of determining the
17 extent of change to the human microbiome caused by space travel and implications for astronaut
18 health. We also address several challenges that Will need to be overcome in order to facilitate
19 long-duration human exploration missions. These challenges include maintaining environmental
20 conditions that favor healthy microbiomes, controlling the microbial organisms astronauts are
21 exposed to, the impact of galactic cosmic radiation on the microbiome, and medical interventions
22 that can potentially damage the microbiome.
23 Introduction
24 A manned mission to Mars Will present a host of challenges for the astronauts making the long
25 journey, including the difficulty of maintaining a healthy microbiome. The human microbiome
26 is the collection of all microorganisms residing in and 011 the human body, and includes bacteria,

"
"3","27 arohaea, single-oelled eukaryotes and Viruses. Our miorobiome helps us break down food,

28 protects us from infection and bolsters our immune system; we could not live without it.

29 However, imbalances in oommensal miorobiota have been associated with a wide range of

30 medical conditions, from irritable bowel syndrome [1] to diabetes [2], different types of cancer
31 [3] and even depression [4] (Fig. 1). Frequently, the transition from a healthy to a disease state is
32 accompanied by inﬂammation and a reduction in microbial diversity. Stressful conditions, like
33 those typically found during a space mission, including cosmic radiation [5, 6] and microgravity
34 [7], have been shown to promote microbial dysbiosis and changes in bacterial physiology [8-11].
35 Therefore, keeping a healthy miorobiome during the 1000+ days of a manned mission to Mars

36 will not only be challenging, but also imperative for crew health and mission success.

37 Maintaining a healthy and diverse miorobiome on Earth is something most people do not think
38 about. You take in microbes when you breathe, when you eat food, or even wipe your mouth.

39 You encounter microbes when you shower, use your keyboard, or kiss your children. We are

40 constantly replenishing our miorobiomes with a fresh collection of new organisms that help us

41 maintain a diverse and healthy collection of microbes [12-15]. Taking in a greater diversity of
42 organisms is usually correlated with a healthier miorobiorne, and chronic health issues like

43 asthma have even been correlated with population shifts from rural to urban living spaces, and
44 the subsequent reduction of exposure to a diverse collection of microorganisms in urban

45 environments [16].

46 Not all of the organisms we incorporate from the environment are beneﬁcial to humans. Some
47 microorganisms are opportunistic pathogens, a term that describes organisms that are healthy or
48 neutral at low concentrations, but become pathogens when their populations increase or under

49 certain favorable environmental conditions, such as an altered host miorobiome or a weakened
50 immune system. Most opportunistic pathogens are outeompeted by oommensal organisms, and
51 only become a medical concern when a healthy miorobiome is damaged or thrown out of

52 balance.

53 While on a space mission, astronauts do not get the same replenishment of microbes that they get
54 on Earth. The traditional View of health microbiology is that microbes make you sick and should
55 be removed from the spacecraft environment whenever possible. Astronauts” food is specially
56 designed to last for long periods of time and has almost no microbial content [17]. To minimize

"
"4","57 the risk of infections, the air that astronauts breathe on space missions is heaVily ﬁltered, and

58 everything shipped to the 188 is monitored to remove as many microorganisms as possible [18].
59 While keeping an extremely clean spaceship environment has been an effective preventive

6O measure for protecting astronauts from infections caused by many dangerous pathogens, the lack
61 of microbial intake for long periods of time may have a detrimental effect on the diversity of the
62 crew microbiota and, therefore, on astronaut health, to a sufﬁcient extent that it may not be a

63 Viable strategy for long-term space missions.

64 While many impacts caused by microbiome imbalances, like diarrhea in Irritable Bowel

65 Syndrome (1B S), are inconvenient and painful on Earth, they would be extremely distracting on
66 space missions where astronauts need to stay healthy and focused on the mission obj eetives. A
67 great deal of microbiome research is currently being conducted by NASA to determine how best
68 to maintain mierobiome homeostasis and astronaut health on future long-duration exploration

69 missions.

70 Past and Current Research

71 A signiﬁcant amount of microbiology research has been done that spans the Apollo, Skylab,

72 Space Shuttle, and International Space Station (188) programs. Until relatively recently, space
73 microbiology research and monitoring consisted of growing microorganisms in petri dishes, and
74 using microscopy and biochemical assays to determine what organism was present and what

75 chemistry that particular organism was performing. Culture-based microbiology has the beneﬁt
76 0f singling out an individual organism so that the observed chemistry can be attributed to that

77 organism.

78 Identiﬁcation of microbes associated with astronauts and space vehicles has been an active area
79 of research, and reduction of pathogens from space missions has been a maj or priority from both
80 a research and monitoring perspective [18]. During the Apollo missions, the microbiomes 0f

81 astronauts were classified in order to later recognize terrestrial contamination in lunar samples
82 returned to Earth. Apollo astronauts were also examined to identify future microbial health

83 hazards for the coming Skylab missions [19]. During the Skylab program, astronauts were

84 methodically sampled before, during, and after missions, and it was found that while overall

85 gastrointestinal (GI) microbial counts went up, diversity of the GI community went down

"
"5","86 following space ﬂight. They also found an increase in certain pathogens like Serratia
87 marcescens and Staphylococcus. aureus after space ﬂight, and it was shown that S. aureus was
88 transferred from astronaut t0 astronaut [20], demonstrating that pathogens can be transmitted
89 between crew members in the confined environment of a spaceship.
90 Traveling to space has been shown to reduce immune functioning in astronauts [21-23] causing
91 reactivation of latent Viruses like herpes simplex Virus 1, varicella zoster Virus, and Epstein-Bar
92 Virus [24-27] in astronauts on short- (weeks) and long- (months) duration missions. These
93 Viruses remain latent in humans and our immune systems usually keep them inactive, but they
94 become reactivated in astronauts. That means that even if an opportunistic pathogen is dormant
95 or present at trace, undetectable levels in an astronaut before they embark on a mission, reduced
96 immune function may create a favorable environment for their reactivation or growth, becoming
97 a potential health risk.
98 In recent years, advances in 0mies technologies have allowed researchers to perform genome-
99 wide experiments to investigate the effects of space travel on microorganisms. These studies
100 have demonstrated that several bacteria change their behavior, Virulence, and gene expression
101 under microgravity conditions. The opportunistic pathogen S. aureus, for instance, has been
102 shown to form bioﬁlms under simulated microgravity, causing a reduction in overall Virulence
103 and growth [9]. Another opportunistic pathogen, Pseudomonas aeruginosa PAOl, was shown to
104 change gene and protein expression under real or modeled microgravity, but it is unknown if
105 these changes increase virulence of the pathogen [28]. The fungal pathogen Candida albicans
106 changed its budding conﬁguration, gene expression, and cell aggregation while grown in space,
107 although no enhancement of Virulence was detected [29]. Salmonella enterica serovar
108 Typhimurium, 0n the other hand, was shown to increase Virulence, cell counts in infected mice,
109 and survival within a macrophage cell line when grown in simulated microgravity [11].
110 There are several drawbacks to eulture-based microbiology, including the fact that the maj ority
111 of known microbes cannot be grown in the lab. The exact percentage of microbes that can be
112 cultured is still debated, but entire phyla of microbes have only been identiﬁed by marker gene
113 studies with no cultured representatives [30]. There is also the danger that isolating a
114 microorganism that usually eXists in a mixed community of organisms will cause it to change its

"
"6","115 behavior. Because of this, several oulture-independent methods of investigating microbial

116 communities have been developed and are being applied to space microbiology research.

117 The Astronaut Miorobiome proj eot is a large study currently underway that seeks to employ

118 oulture-independent methods for studying the miorobiome of astronauts, surfaces, and water at
119 the 188 [31]. The proj eot seeks to track the miorobiome of astronauts before, during, and after
120 188 missions lasting from siX months to one year using multiple techniques With the goal of

121 measuring changes in the miorobiome during space ﬂight. The ﬁrst technique involves

122 sequencing of the 16s ribosomal RNA gene, Which is a marker that all microbial life possesses
123 and allows identiﬁcation of the microbes living in an environment. This approach provides a
124 snapshot of bacteria present in an environment When the sample was taken. While this is helpful
125 knowledge, 16s analysis does not provide accurate information about the biological functions
126 performed by most of these microorganisms, making further investigation necessary. The

127 second approach used by the proj eot is metagenomio sequencing, Which consists of sequencing
128 all the DNA molecules present in an environment, and Which determines the chemistry and

129 metabolism that could be performed by the collection of genes encoded by the sequenced DNA
130 molecules. Metagenomios is a more expensive and computationally intensive process, but it

131 provides a more comprehensive knowledge about the chemical and metabolic potential of a

132 microbial community compared to 16s analysis. The Human Miorobiome Proj eot found that
133 While the collection of microbial taxa may change among subj eots from a particular healthy

134 human cohort, the metabolic pathways represented by those organisms tend to remain relatively
135 constant [32]. Therefore, to evaluate how perturbations in the astronauts” miorobiome promoted
136 by space missions affect crew health, it is necessary not only to look at changes in microbial taxa
137 through 16s analysis, but also to carry out metagenomios studies to evaluate the impact of those
138 changes on the metabolic capacity of the miorobiome. Identiﬁcation of variations in encoded
139 microbial metabolic pathways during space ﬂight Will shed light into the impact of space travel
140 on the miorobiome and deﬁne What intervention, if any, is needed to maintain a balanced and
141 healthy miorobiome on long-duration exploration missions.

142 Future Directions

143 Methods for maintaining a balanced and healthy miorobiome on long-term space missions Will
144 likely be a subj eot for ongoing research in the foreseeable future. Here we Will address several

"
"7","145 areas of needed microbiome research as it relates to space travel. The ﬁrst question is: HOW do
146 we create environments in and around the astronauts that allow commensal organisms to ﬂourish
147 While still keeping pathogen concentrations as low as possible? And beyond that: HOW do we
148 keep up a constant inﬂux of commensal organisms to maintain the microbiomes of astronauts in
149 homeostasis? HOW much damage Will the microbiorne sustain from Galactic Cosmic Radiation
150 (GCR) once astronauts leave the Earth’s Van Allen Belt? Finally, how Will astronauts deal With
151 bacterial infections that require antibiotic intervention and subsequent microbiome damage?

152 Keeping environmental conditions that favor the growth and maintenance ofhealthy bacteria in
153 the astronauts ’ gut.

154 Prebiotics is a generic term used to describe dietary interventions that seek to create a healthy
155 environment for the GI mierobiome. Studies comparing the GI microbiome of tribal people,

156 under high-ﬁber low-fat diets, t0 the mierobiome of people from industrialized countries,

157 consuming western diets rich in animal fats and poor in ﬁber, highlight the impact of diet on

158 human health [33-35]. Indeed, these studies have shown that people following a western diet
159 present a number of changes in their GI mierobiota and metabolites that have been implicated in
160 a number of human diseases, including cancer [3, 35] and inﬂammatory bowel disease [36, 37].
161 Typically, these changes involve a less diverse gut mierobiota, characterized by the loss of major
162 butyrate-produeing taxa and several microbial metabolic pathways, such as butyrogenesis and
163 saccharolytic fermentation, known to protect against inﬂammation and reduce cancer risk [38].
164 Fortunately, these disease-assoeiated features can be reverted in a relatively short period of time
165 When switching to a low-fat high-ﬁber diet [35].

166 Although still not conclusive, there is a wealth of evidence suggesting that space travel may lead
167 to microbial dysbiosis and metabolic changes in the human gut, including a drop in alpha

168 diversity and changes in gene expression of culturable bacteria. Also, reported dysregulation of
169 the astronauts” immune system following short and long space ﬂights, may be a consequence to
170 in-ﬂight alterations of the GI mierobiota. It is likely that these negative effects might be

171 potentially controlled or even prevented by diet-based therapies proven to promote a healthier G1
172 microbial composition, such as those With a higher content of ﬁber [39, 40].

"
"8","173 One way to add ﬁber to a diet is to increase the intake of fresh fruit and vegetables. To

174 investigate whether this type of diet ameliorates the impact of spaoe-travel on the immune

175 system, gut microbial composition and overall astronaut’s health, NASA has funded a proj eot
176 titled “Food Physiology” [41] which will seek to measure changes in the gut miorobiome,

177 immune system and metabolites when fresh fruit, vegetables, and ﬁsh (which contain omega3
178 fatty acids) are added to an astronaut’s diet. Fresh fruit and vegetables have the added beneﬁt of
179 association with healthy soil, one of the most miorobially diverse environments we know of [42].
180 While getting fresh fruit and vegetables to the 188 is an expensive but theoretically feasible

181 proposition, it would only work on a mission to Mars if plants were gown in the spacecraft.

182 Hydroponic gardens onboard space ships make for beautiful cinematography, but they create a
183 host of issues for astronauts. Where do they get fresh soil? What do they do with the leftover
184 plant material they do not eat? If they compost plant and astronaut waste, how do they keep

185 humidity and fungus from spreading to the rest of the ship? Studies are currently underway at
186 the 188 to better understand how to grow fruits and vegetables in space, but more research is
187 necessary before spaoe-grown food could make up a substantial portion of an astronaut’s diet
188 [43, 44].

189 Another approach would be to try increasing the prebiotio qualities of space food, but that

190 method also faces limitations. Food for a trip to Mars must be preserved for years and still be
191 palatable. Astronauts will need to take food with them for the entire expedition, which places
192 strict limits on the composition of the food [17].

193 Controlling the inﬂux Ofcommensal organisms to maintain the microbiomes ofastronauts in
194 homeostasis.

195 It was mentioned earlier that microbial diversity in the GI tract of astronauts went down during
196 the Skylab space missions [20]. There are likely several reasons for this phenomenon including
197 nearly sterile meals and heaVily filtered water and air. Astronauts aren’t exposed to the same
198 inputs of microorganisms as those present in terrestrial environments, and while transmission of
199 bacteria from spacecraft to astronaut has been demonstrated [20], it by no means makes up for
200 the lack of incoming microbial diversity. There are several approaches that could address this
201 shortfall of new microbial species. As previously discussed, growing fresh fruit and vegetables

"
"9","202 in-ﬂight has many positive aspects but also comes with a host of logistical issues that would need
203 to be worked out.

204 An alternative approach for introducing a constant input of microbial diversity to astronauts on
205 long-duration missions would be prophylactic use of probiotios. Probiotios is a generic term
206 used to describe dietary inputs of beneficial microbes. Probiotios can describe anything from
207 yogurt with live cultures of bacteria and fungi, pills containing specific consortia of organisms,
208 and even fecal transplants from healthy individuals. Humans have been eating probiotios in one
209 form or another for much of our history, and the FDA labels many organisms as Generally

210 Recognized As Safe, whose metabolic potential is unknown, but that humans have been

211 consuming for many years without adverse health effects [45].

212 Use of probiotios would have several advantages, including ease of use, packaging, and storage,
213 as well as being low on mass and space requirements, which will be issues on a trip to Mars.
214 Further studies will be required to determine the most advantageous combination of

215 microorganisms, as well as delivery mechanisms best suited for long-term stowage and stability
216 during long-duration space missions [46].

217 Impact ofGalactic Cosmic Radiation (GCR) 0n the astronauts ’ microbiome beyond the Earth ’5
218 Van Allen Belt.

219 One question, which will need to be addressed before a human mission to Mars becomes a

220 reality, is how to deal with GCR and, speciﬁcally, any potential damage it may cause to the

221 miorobiome. Astronauts on a mission to Mars will encounter low dosages of high-energy

222 radiation that is ubiquitous outside of the Earth’s Van Allen Belt [47]. Astronauts at the 188 are
223 shielded from the full effects of GCR because the orbit of the 188 is still inside the Van Allen
224 Belt, meaning researchers have a limited knowledge about the effects of constant low-dosage
225 radiation on the crew miorobiome. Most microbes are not resistant to radiation, and studies that
226 have investigated the effect of higher doses of radiation on Earth have demonstrated that

227 radiation can cause substantial damage to the miorobiome [5, 6]. To further complicate matters,
228 GCR could potentially damage most microbes in the spacecraft, including those on and in the
229 astronaut body as well as those from probiotio stocks. Further research will need to address

"
"10","230 potential GCR damage to the miorobiome so that more complete measures of risk to the

231 astronaut’s health can be determined.

232 Antibiotic usage and microbial dysbiosis.

233 Currently, the recommended countermeasure to deal With bacterial infections in the 188 is the
234 administration of antibiotics. Antibiotics have been an effective method for treating bacterial
235 infections for many years. While antibiotics Will effectively remove most bacterial infections,
236 they Will also do substantial damage to the oommensal members of the GI miorobiome [48].

237 This can cause a range of issues, including pathogenic colonization of Clostridium dzfﬁcile,

238 Which can cause chronic GI issues and extreme diarrhea [49, 50]. In normal conditions, C.

239 dzfﬁcile is usually present at low levels in the human GI tract, mostly due to competitive

240 displacement by oommensal GI microbes. However, C. dzfﬁcile has been found to colonize the
241 GI tract When oommensal GI microbial communities are damaged by antibiotics [50].

242 Probiotios constitute an excellent option to help replenish the GI miorobiome during and after
243 antibiotic treatment, and they are currently used clinically to treat C. diﬁﬁcile infections that are
244 resistant to antibiotics [51-56]. One potential issue for long-duration space missions is that

245 probiotios provide only a limited selection of oommensal GI organisms. On Earth, probiotio use
246 is supplemented by a healthy inﬂux of organisms from food, water, and air; these are sources of
247 oommensal organisms not currently available to astronauts in-ﬂight.

248 One option for emergency in-ﬂight antibiotic use may be to package astronauts’ stool into

249 probiotio capsules While they are healthy on Earth. This would allow an astronaut to refresh

250 their GI miorobiome With a diverse set of organisms from their own healthy GI tract. Regardless
251 of the source, one or more methods of rebalanoing a damaged miorobiome Will be essential for
252 long-duration space missions.

253 Conclusion

254 Extensive research into the maintenance of a healthy miorobiome of astronauts on space

255 missions has been a topic of research for decades, and further studies are currently underway.
256 These studies are starting to reveal that space travel alters the composition and physiology of the
257 astronauts” gut miorobiome. In the long run, compositional changes in the gut ﬂora, in

"
"11","258 combination With an already weakened immune response, might pave the way for infections by
259 opportunistic pathogens 0r predispose astronauts to a number of diseases such as IBS or even
260 cancer. This scenario could be made worse by long-term exposure to the extremely clean

261 environment of the spacecraft and the potential deleterious effect of GCR 0n the astronauts”

262 mierobiota, and therefore, the risks associated With these factors should be explored in more

263 depth.

264 Diet based therapies, such as the incorporation of fresh fruit and vegetables, are a promising

265 countermeasure to deal With health risks associated With microbial dysbiosis in space. Fiber-rich
266 diets promote the growth of healthy butyrate-produeing bacteria in the gut and help to revert

267 metabolite-proﬁles associated With human diseases. Although space farming is still in its

268 infancy, the Food Physiology proj eet at NASA Will use a combination of metabolomics,

269 metatranscriptomies, 16s taxonomic proﬁling and immunological approaches to directly test the
270 hypothesis that diets rich in fiber are able to reverse the detrimental effects of space travel on the
271 human mierobiome and immune response.

272 Probiotics are also a promising alternative to ﬁght microbial dysbiosis in space, particularly in
273 situations Where the GI ﬂora has been signiﬁcantly depleted of its original microbial content, for
274 example following antibiotic treatment. Further research Will be needed to determine Whether
275 commercially available probioties containing just a small number of beneﬁcial bacteria species
276 0r fecal transplant pills are the more effective therapy for restoring an altered gut mierobiome.
