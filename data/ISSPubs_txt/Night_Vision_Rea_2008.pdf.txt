l Abstract ﬂ
Pznpose: Long—term space exploration requires biological life support systems capable of coping with the deleterious space ..
environment. The use ofoxygenic photosynthetic microorganisms represents an intriguing topic in this context, mainly from ""
the point of View of food and 03 production. The aim of the present study was to assess the effects of space ionizing radiation f
exposure on the photosynthetic activity of various microorganisms. f.
l A‘Iazerz'als and methods: Ground-based irradiation experiments were performed using fast neutrons and gamma rays on
I microorganisms maintained at various light conditions. A stratospheric balloon and a European Space Agency (ESA) ﬂight t
i facility were used to deliver organisms to space at the altitude of 38 and 300 km, respectively. During the balloon ﬂight, the [1
i . . . . . . . .
ﬂuorescence actwity oi the organisms was real—time monltored by means of a speCIal biosensor. i
1 Results: The quantum yield of Photosystem II (PSII), measured directly in ﬂight, varied among the microorganisms ‘1
depending on the light conditions. Darkness and irradiation of cells at 120 and 180 [(11101 mi ‘ s 1 enhanced the radiation- '
induced inhibition ofphotosynthetic activity, while exposure to weaker light irradiance of 20 and 70 ,umol m’ ‘ s 1 protected
I the cells against damage. Cell permanence in space reduced the photosynthetic grOWth while the oxygen evolution capacity of '
the cells after the ﬂight was enhanced.
szclusz'mzs: A potential role of P811 in capturing and utilizing ionizing radiation energy is postulated.
