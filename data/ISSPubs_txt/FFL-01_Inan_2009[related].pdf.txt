The system presented in this paper for monitoring ﬂy activity is
an inexpensive, compact, and ultralow bandwidth alternative to cur-
rently available options, making it a suitable candidate for biological
experiments on small satellites or ﬁeld experiments. In contrast to most
actimeters, multiple ﬂies can be imaged in a small apparatus. Addi-
tionally, the ﬂies are contained in a larger Chamber (20 cm2 vs., e.g.,

1.2 01112) that permits motion in two axes rather than one. This may
allow the ﬂy behaVior to more Closely approximate the natural state.

It should be noted, however, that a current limitation of this system is
that it does not provide information regarding the speed of movement,
distance moved, or spatial distribution of the ﬂies. Speed of movement
is a parameter that may be encoded in the amplitude of the activity
signal, and this is the subj ect of current investigations. Additionally, to
permit motion in the vertical direction as well, an approach with two
perpendicular cameras is being constructed. This would allow studies
of lateral motion and ﬂight without signiﬁcantly increasing cost or size. —

The methods for monitoring and analyzing the ﬂy movement detected
by each camera would be similar to those presented in this paper.
Finally, the method described in this paper could be used to image
other species, rendering it a versatile solution for many behaVioral
studies.
