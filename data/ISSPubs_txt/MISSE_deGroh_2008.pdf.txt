Abstract
NASA Glenn Research Center (Glenn) has 39 individual materials ﬂight experiments (>540 samples)
ﬂown as part of the Materials International Space Station Experiment (MISSE) to address long duration
environmental durability of spacecraft materials in low Earth orbit (LEO). MISSE is a series of materials
ﬂight experiments consisting of trays, called Passive Experiment Carriers (PECs) that are exposed to the
space environment on the exterior of the International Space Station (188). MISSE 1-5 have been
successfully ﬂown and retrieved and were exposed to the space environment from one to four years. MISSE
6A & 6B were deployed during the STS-123 shuttle mission in March 2008, and MISSE 7A & 7B are being
prepared for launch in 2009. The Glenn MISSE experiments address atomic oxygen (A0) effects such as
erosion and undercutting of polymers, AO scattering, stress effects on AO erosion, and in-situ AO ﬂuenoe
monitoring. Experiments also address solar radiation effects such as radiation induced polymer shrinkage,
stress effects on radiation degradation of polymers, and radiation degradation of indium tin oxide (ITO)
coatings and spacesuit fabrics. Additional experiments address combined A0 and solar radiation effects on
thermal control ﬁlms, paints and oermet coatings. Experiments with Orion Crew Exploration Vehicle (CEV)
seals and UltraFleX solar array materials are also being ﬂown. Several experiments were designed to provide
ground-faoility to in-spaoe calibration data thus enabling more accurate in-spaoe performance predictions
based on ground-laboratory testing. This paper provides an overview of Glenn’s MISSE 1-7 ﬂight
experiments along with a summary of results from Glenn’s MISSE 1 & 2 experiments.
1. Introduction
Functional materials used on the exterior of spacecraft are subjected to many environmental threats that
can cause degradation in materials properties, possibly threatening spacecraft mission success. In LEO these
threats include AO, photon radiation, charged particle radiation, temperature effects and thermal cycling,
impacts from miorometeoroids and debris, and contamination. Atomic oxygen is the most predominant
species in LEO and is present in other planetary orbital environments. At spacecraft velocities, LEO A0 is
energetic enough (z4.5 eV) to cause bond breakage and subsequent oxidation. The oxidation products of
most polymers are gas species, therefore material erosion occurs. Atomic oxygen can produce serious
structural, thermal or optical degradation of spacecraft components.

F igure 2. Atomic oxygen undercutting degradation 0fthe solar array wing blanket box cover on ISS.

Figure 1 shows AO erosion of Teﬂ0n® ﬂuorinated ethylene propylene (FEP) around a small
protective particle. To assess the AO durability of a material for mission applicability, the erosion yield
(volume loss in cm3 per incident oxygen atom) needs to be characterized using actual space ﬂight data, as
ground AO facilities do not perfectly simulate the space environment.

The most common approach to protecting susceptible spacecraft materials from A0 erosion is to coat
the material with a thin AO protective ﬁlm, such as SiOX. Unfortunately, microscopic scratches, dust
particles or other imperfections in the substrate surface can result in defects in the protective coating.
These coating defects can provide pathways for A0 attack and undercutting erosion of the substrate can
occur. Undercutting erosion can be a serious threat to component survivability. An example is shown in
Figure 2, where AO undercutting erosion has severely degraded the P6 Truss port solar array wing two-
surface aluminized-Kapton® blanket box cover on the 188.1

An example of radiation induced polymer degradation is found through extensive embrittlement of
thermal control insulation on the Hubble Space Telescope (HST). During the second servicing mission
(8M2), after 6.8 years in space, severe cracking was observed in the aluminized-Teﬂon ﬂuorinated
ethylene propylene (Al-FEP) outer layer of the multilayer insulation (MLI) covering the HST Light
Shield. Astronaut observations combined with photographic documentation revealed extensive cracking
of the MLI in many locations, with the solar facing surfaces being heavily damaged.2 Figure 3 shows two
large cracked areas. Extensive testing was conducted on retrieved HST insulation, combined with
ground-based testing, which revealed that embrittlement 0f FEP 0n HST is caused by radiation exposure
(electron and proton radiation, with contributions from solar ﬂare X-rays and ultraviolet (UV) radiation)
combined with thermal effects.2

Unfortunately, accelerated laboratory testing often does not accurately simulate degradation caused
by combined on-orbit environmental exposures. One example was the inability to reproduce the extent of
embrittlement 0f Al-FEP insulation on the HST based on mission ﬂuence requirements.3 The fact that
highly accelerated ground-laboratory testing did not replicate the on-orbit degradation highlights the
necessity of actual long-duration space ﬂight data.

contribution to MISSE 5’s primary experiment, the Forward Technology Solar Cell Experiment (FTSCE).
The Glenn MISSE l & 2 materials experiments have already had a direct impact on the Exploration space

2. Materials International Space Station Experiment (MISSE) Overview

MISSE is a series of materials ﬂight experiments consisting of trays, called PECs, which are exposed to
the space environment on the exterior of the ISS providing long-duration space exposure. Each PEC
consists of two trays, hinged like a suitcase, as shown in Figure 4. The PECs are closed with the samples
facing each other and protected for launch on the shuttle and then are attached to the outside of 188 during an
extravehioular activity (EVA) and opened baok-to—baok, exposing the samples to space. The trays are
typically positioned with one surface facing the ram direction thus receiving A0 and solar radiation (Tray 1),
and the back surface facing the wake direction thus receiving solar radiation with minimal AO exposure
(Tray 2). The overall obj eotive of MISSE is to test the stability and durability of materials and devices in the
space environment in order to gain valuable knowledge on the performance of materials in space as well as
to enable lifetime prediction of new materials and components that may be used in future space ﬂight.

exposure durations. MISSE 6A & 6B were deployed during the STS-123 shuttle mission in March 2008
and were planned as a one-year mission. At the time of writing this paper, MISSE 7A & 7B are being
prepared for a 2009 launch.

Researchers at Glenn are principal investigators (PI) for seven materials experiments, with a total of
80 samples, ﬂown for nearly 4 years on the exterior of the 188 as part of MISSE 1 & 2. These Glenn
experiments investigated AO erosion of unprotected polymers, AO scattering characteristics, and effects
of the overall LEO environment on optical and mechanical properties of polymer ﬁlms. Experiments
were also ﬂown to provide data to calibrate ground-based facilities for simulating LEO AO effects on
polymers with protective coatings. Results of these experiments are provided, along with an example of
how the data are being used to improve LEO environmental durability prediction. The use of MISSE 1 &
2 data for durability prediction for speciﬁc missions is also provided.

Glenn has eight spacecraft materials durability experiments (with a total of 71 samples) that were
ﬂown as part of MISSE 3 & 4, and four experiments (with 105 samples) ﬂown as part of MISSE 5.
Glenn was also actively involved in the MISSE 5 FTSCE experiment. The MISSE 5 mission, which
received 13 months of space exposure, ﬂew directly after retrieval of MISSE 1 & 2. MISSE 3 & 4, which
was deployed before retrieval of MISSE 5, received 1 year of space exposure. Post-ﬂight sample
documentation and analyses have begun on these experiments.

MISSE 6 and 7 differ from the prior trays in that many of the experiments are active experiments.
The MISSE 6 active experiments are powered by 188 and the data are being stored on data loggers and
will be available when the experiments are retrieved. NASA Glenn has siX active experiments and siX
passive experiments on MISSE 6, with a total of 168 samples that are integrated into the two MISSE 6
PECs (6A & 6B). MISSE 6 was delivered to 188 during the STS-123 mission, and both 6A and 6B were
placed outside of the Columbus Module on March 22, 2008. MISSE 7 will be powered by, and will have
communication links through 188. Hence, the active data will be retrieved daily Via telemetry. Glenn has
a total of nine experiments (three active and siX passive), with a total of 120 samples that are being
developed for integration into the MISSE 7 PECs, with a planned launch in 2009. MISSE 7A will be
placed in a zenith/nadir orientation and MISSE 7B will be placed in a ram/wake orientation. The Glenn
MISSE 6 & 7 experiments include Exploration Mission relevant materials such as spacesuit fabrics,
thermal control blanket polymers and paints, solar array blanket materials, o-ring seals, and dust
mitigation materials.

"10","Estimated environmental conditions of AO, solar exposure, tray temperatures, and ionizing radiation
doses on MISSE 1 & 2 are described in detail by Pippin.4 Black light inspection of the trays showed
minimal to no contamination on the MISSE surfaces.4 Results of X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS)
contamination analysis of two MISSE 2 sapphire witness samples in MISSE 2 ram sample tray E6
indicated an extremely thin silica contaminant 1ayer (1.3 and 1.4 nm on each slide, respectively).5 A
small amount of ﬂuorine was also detected.5 The MISSE 2 environment was found to be an unusually
clean environment with very low spacecraft induced molecular contamination. This is due to low
outgassing of other MISSE 2 Tray 1 materials and also due to the position of MISSE 2 on 188.
Therefore, the ﬂight data was not affected by contamination. This further increases the importance of this
long duration ﬂight data.

4.1 Polymer Erosion and Contamination Experiment (PEACE) Polymers Experiment

(MISSE 2)

The PEACE Polymers experiment included 41 — 1” (2.54 cm) diameter samples (39 polymer samples
and 2 Kapton H AO ﬂuence witness samples). The experiment (sample tray E5) was ﬂown on the ram side
of MISSE 2 and was exposed to A0 along with solar and charged particle radiation (see Figure 6). The
objective of the MISSE 2 PEACE Polymers experiment was to accurately determine the AO erosion yield
(Ey) of a wide variety of polymeric materials exposed for an extended period of time to the LEO space
environment. The polymers range from those commonly used for spacecraft applications, such as Teﬂon®
FEP, to more recently developed polymers, such as high temperature polyimide PMR (polymerization of
monomer reactants). Additional polymers were included to explore erosion yield dependence upon chemical
composition so that an A0 erosion yield predictive tool could be developed. The majority of samples were
comprised of thin ﬁlm polymers, with numerous layers stacked together to last a minimum of 3 years in
LEO. The MISSE 2 PEACE Polymers experiment is unique because it contains the widest variety of well-
documented polymers exposed to identical long duration LEO AO conditions.

Figure 7 provides photos of the MISSE 2 PEACE Polymers experiment prior to, and after, LEO space
exposure. Although MISSE 2 was supposed to be a 1.5 year mission, planning for a three-year mission
exposure was crucial in the success of this experiment, as it was exposed to LEO A0 for four years. The
A0 ﬂuence for the experiment was determined to be 8.43 X 1021 atoms/cm2 based on mass loss of the two
polyimide Kapton H witness samples. Atomic oxygen erosion yield values have been determined for each
of the MISSE 2 PEACE polymers based on mass loss obtained from pre-ﬂight and post-ﬂight vacuum
dehydrated samples. Table 3 provides a list of each of the MISSE 2 PEACE Polymer samples, the MISSE 2
mass loss, the sample density, the exposure area and the MISSE 2 erosion yield data.6 Details on the speciﬁc
polymers ﬂown, ﬂight sample fabrication, pre-ﬂight and post—ﬂight characterization techniques, AO ﬂuence
calculations and A0 erosion yield results are reported by de Groh eta1.6’7

"
"12","An extensive error analysis was conducted to determine the error in the erosion yield values for each
of the MISSE 2 PEACE Polymers ﬂight samples. Three different equations were needed for determining
mass loss of the ﬂight samples, which is a factor in determining erosion yield. Therefore, it was
necessary to develop three different equations for determining the fractional uncertainty in the erosion
yield. SiX of the 41 samples were partially or completely eroded through all layers, hence the erosion
yield values for these samples are greater than those computed. These siX polymers are being re-ﬂown in
the MISSE 6 Stressed PEACE Polymers experiment (see Section 7.1 below).

4.1.1 Atomic Oxygen Erosion Yield Predictive T 00]

The MISSE 2 PEACE Polymers experiment consisted of 40 structurally different polymers (including
the Kapton H witness samples) not only to allow accurate measurement of the AO erosion yields of
commonly used polymers, but also to allow the development of a space validated AO erosion yield
predictive tool that can approximate the LEO erosion yields of polymers based on structural chemistry
and physical properties. The value of such a predictive tool is that as new polymers emerge, one would
not have to wait for several years for ﬂight experiment results to obtain AO durability information. A
Glenn Atomic Oxygen Erosion Yield Predictive Tool has been developed based on best ﬁt criteria for the
MISSE 2 PEACE Polymers erosion yield data. The predictive tool utilizes polymer structural and
physical properties, such as number and types of chemical bonds, density and ash content. The Atomic
Oxygen Erosion Yield Predictive Tool is described in detail by Banks et al.8
4.1.2 Ground-Labomtory t0 In-Space Correlation

Although space ﬂight experiments, such as the MISSE 2 PEACE experiment, are ideal for
determining LEO environmental durability of spacecraft materials, ground-laboratory testing is most
often relied upon for durability evaluation and prediction. Unfortunately, signiﬁcant differences eXist
between LEO A0 and A0 in test facilities. These differences include variations in species, energies,
thermal exposures and radiation exposures, all of which can result in different reactions and erosion rates.
In an effort to improve the accuracy of ground-based durability testing, ground-laboratory to in-spaoe AO
correlation experiments have been conducted based on the MISSE 2 PEACE polymers ﬂight data. In
these tests, the AO erosion yields of the 39 PEACE polymers were determined relative to Kapton H using
a radio-frequenoy (RF) plasma asher operated on air with the samples in metal holders. The asher erosion
yields were compared to the MISSE 2 erosion yields for the PEACE polymers to determine the
correlation between erosion rates in the two environments. The asher erosion yield of every polymer was
higher than that of its in-spaoe counterpart, and the asher to in-spaoe erosion yield ratios ranged from 1.0
(1.02) to 37.1. The ﬂuoropolymers in particular had higher ratios, ranging from 6.1 to 8.0. Kevlar, a
woven fabric, had a ratio of 24.0, and White Tedlar, a material containing AO durable ﬁller particles, had
a ratio of 37.1. Details of this research, along with the asher-to-spaoe Ey ratios, are provided by Stambler
et al.8
4.1.3 Application to the Commercial Orbital T ransportation System (COTS)

As one example of the use of MISSE data for Exploration Mission applications, the MISSE 2 PEACE
Polymers Ey data has been used to evaluate the effects of AO texturing of a potential solar cell polymer
cover being considered for the COTS mission solar array. The candidate polymer, polyvinyl ﬂuoride
(PVF, Tedlar), was subjected to end Hall AO (~70 eV 02+ ions) and then vacuum ultraViolet (VUV)
radiation to determine the effects of the combined A0 and VUV radiation (from deuterium lamps) on
solar cell performance. The erosion yield of PVF from the MISSE 2 PEACE Polymers experiment was
used along with the mission ﬂuenoe requirement to determine the expected mass loss per area. This mass
loss per area was then replicated in the end Hall AO facility to properly simulate the LEO erosion

causing a slight loss in solar transmittance.
4.1.4 PEACE T eam Collaboration

Glenn has numerous collaborative MISSE experiments with Hathaway Brown School in Shaker
Heights, Ohio. These experiments include the MISSE 2 and MISSE 5 PEACE Polymers experiments, the
MISSE 6A Stressed PEACE Polymers Experiment, and the MISSE 7B Polymers Experiment. Hathaway
Brown School is Ohio’s oldest independent day school for girls. Through Hathaway Brown’s Science
Research & Engineering Program (SERP) students join the Glenn/HB “PEACE” team, where they can
work on MISSE research at NASA Glenn throughout their entire high school career. Over the past 10
years, 20 students have been part of the Glenn/HB PEACE team. To date the student involvement has
included: MISSE pre-ﬂight research, MISSE 2, 5, 6A and 7B ﬂight sample fabrication, pre-ﬂight
characterization, and MISSE 2 post-ﬂight characterization & error analyses. The students have authored
research papers, presented their work at an international conference, and entered their research in science
fairs, winning over $80,000 in scholarships and awards through this collaboration.

4.1.5 The Handbook ofAtomic Oxygen Erosion

Glenn plans to write a Handbook of Atomic Oxygen Erosion, as a NASA Special Publication or
NASA Standard, which will document the MISSE 2 PEACE Polymers AO erosion yield data, allowing
proper selection of materials and thickness for future long-duration space ﬂight missions. The Handbook
will include an extensive background on LEO A0 and will document the AO erosion yield of the MISSE
2 PEACE Polymers. Details on the speciﬁc polymers ﬂown, ﬂight sample fabrication techniques, pre-
ﬂight and post-ﬂight characterization, and mission AO ﬂuenoe calculations will be documented along
with a summary of the AO erosion yield results. Details of the corresponding erosion yield error analyses
will also be included along with the Glenn Atomic Oxygen Erosion Yield Predictive Tool. The handbook
will inform users on how to use the predictive tool and how to use the erosion yield data for spacecraft
durability prediction.

4.2 Spacecraft Silicones Experiment (MISSE 2 & 4)

The objective of the Spacecraft Silicones Experiment was to determine changes in optical properties
and nanomeehanioal surface hardness of silicones exposed to various LEO A0 and UV radiation ﬂuenoe
levels. Silicones are widely used on spacecraft, such as the use of DC 93-500 to bond cover glasses to
solar cells for the ISS photovoltaic array blankets or as protective coatings on the back of solar arrays.
Silicones have previously been thought of as being AO durable because they typically do not lose weight
in an A0 environment and the surface converts to a glassy SiOX layer.10 Unfortunately, the oxidized
glassy layer eventually shrinks as it densiﬁes and cracks form, exposing the underlying silicone or coated
substrate to AD.10 Surface hardness measurements for silicones exposed to various AO ﬂuenoes are
desired so that comparisons of equivalent ﬂuenoes can be made with A0 ground-laboratory exposed
samples. These comparisons will allow ground-faeility to in-spaoe AO equivalent ﬂuenees to be
determined, such as those reported by de Groh, Banks & Ma.11 It is important to ﬁnd a technique which
enables effective ﬂuenoes in ground facilities to be determined based on space data because traditional
mass loss techniques do not work for silicones. Obtaining miorohardness data on MISSE ﬂown silicone
samples will allow this correlation to be made for high ﬂuenoe exposures. Therefore, the MISSE 2 and
MISSE 4 Spacecraft Silicones Experiments each included four DC 93-500 silicone samples. Three of the
four samples were covered with different thickness layers of Kapton H (0.3 mil, 0.5 mil and 0.8 mil) in
order for each of the samples in the same experiment to receive different AO ﬂuenoes, as the AO needs to
erode through the over-laying Kapton before attacking the underlying silicone. Because the 10 mil thick
silicone samples are rubbery and can stick to smooth surfaces, they were placed on 1/16” (0.16 cm) thick
NASA/TM—2008-215482 9

"
"14","fused silica slides to allow post-ﬂight optical properties to be made without the samples bending and
hence inducing cracking in the glassy oxidized layer. Silicones can darken with A0 and UV radiation
exposure increasing the solar absorptance 0f the material, and hence knowledge of the degree of
darkening on-orbit is desired. The MISSE 2 Spacecraft Silicones Experiment samples were ﬂown in PEC
2 sample tray E5 (samples 2-E5-1 to 2-E5-4), along with the MISSE 2 PEACE Polymers experiment, and
were exposed to ram exposure for 4 years. The MISSE 4 Spacecraft Silicones Experiment samples were
exposed to ram exposure for 1 year in MISSE 4 sample tray E22 (samples 2-E22-2 to 2-E22-5).

The MISSE 2 samples all crazed due to A0 exposure, which cause surface shrinking. Figure 8 shows
the “mud-tile” surface that developed due to conversion of the silicone surface to a silicate glassy layer.
Pre-ﬂight and post-ﬂight optical properties were obtained for each of the MISSE 2 samples with the fused
silica base. Two of the back-up samples were also measured post-ﬂight as control samples, with little
change from the pre-ﬂight measurements eight years earlier. The A0 ﬂuence for the MISSE 2 samples
ranged from 8.43 X 1021 atoms/cm2 (no cover) to 7.08 X 1021 atoms/cm2 (0.8 mil thick Kapton cover). The
ﬂuence values are provided in Table 4 along with the pre-ﬂight and control sample optical properties.
Figure 9 is a graph of the total transmittance spectral data for ﬂight sample 2-E5-1 (n0 Kapton H cover)
and for a control sample. Although the reﬂectance did not change signiﬁcantly, the diffuse transmittance
increased, the specular transmittance decreased, the total transmittance decreased and the solar
absorptance increased signiﬁcantly from 0.005 to 0033-0037.

4.3 Scattered Atomic Oxygen Characterization Experiments (MISSE 2 & 4)
When AO impinges upon a typical spacecraft surface (such as anodized aluminum) it can scatter With
a lower ﬂux and lower energy than the incoming AO. Yet scattered AO can react With, and hence, erode
spacecraft components not in A0 direct line of site. Therefore, it is desirable to characterize scattered A0
with respect to its scattering distribution and effective erosion yield. Small (1” (2.54 cm) diameter)
passive Scattered Atomic Oxygen Characterization Experiments have been designed to allow
measurement of the distribution and effective erosion yield of scattered AO (see Figure 10a).
NASA/TM—2008-215482 11

"
"16","In these simple scattering chambers, ram AO passes through an aperture (0.12” (3 mm) diameter) in a
SiOz-ooated polyimide Kapton H oriﬁce plate. The A0 impinges upon an aluminum disk at the bottom of
the chamber and the ejected, scattered, AO can 0Xidize the bottom side of the Kapton H oriﬁce plate (see
Figure 10b). Sodium chloride salt particles have been dusted onto the bottom surface of the oriﬁce plate
to provide isolated protected areas. Post-ﬂight the salt particles are washed off and proﬁlometry is used
to accurately measure the erosion as a function of ejection angle. The results of the MISSE 2 Scattered
Atomic OXygen Characterization EXperiment were rather surprising in that the AO scattered almost
eXClusively, from the bottom aluminum plate at a 45 degree angle rather than being a cosine (Lambertian)
distribution (see Figure 100). The effective erosion yield for Kapton H of the scattered AC was found to
be 6.54 X 10'25 em3/atom which is 21.8% of that of LEO A0 for Kapton H. Details of the eXperiment and
the results are reported by Banks et al., 2006.12
4.4 Double SiOX-Coated Kapton Ground to Space Erosion Correlation Experiment

(Mass Loss) (MISSE 2 & 4)

4.4.1 Experiment Description and Results

The ability to predict the durability of materials in the LEO environment by eXposing them in ground-
based facilities is important because one can achieve test results sooner, eXpose more types of materials,
and do it much more cost effectively than to test them in ﬂight. Flight eXperiments to determine the
durability of groups or classes of materials that behave similarly are needed in order to provide
correlation of how much time in ground-based facilities represents a selected duration in LEO for the
material type of interest. An eXperiment was designed and ﬂown on the ram facing surfaces of MISSE 2
(apprOXimately 4 years of eXposure in LEO) and MISSE 4 (apprOXimately 1 year of eXposure in LEO) in
order to develop this type of correlation between ground-based radio frequency (RF) plasma eXposure,
ground-based thermal energy directed AO beam eXposure, and LEO eXposure for coated Kapton based on
mass loss. The eXperiment consisted of four samples (two for each MISSE ﬂight) of Kapton H polyimide
coated with apprOXimately 1300 angstroms of silicon di0Xide by Sheldahl, Inc. Two of the samples were
eXposed to an A0 effective ﬂuence of apprOXimately 6 X 1019 atoms/om2 in a RF plasma prior to ﬂight
and the remaining two were eXposed to a thermal energy directed beam to an A0 effective ﬂuence of
apprOXimately 1 X 1021 atoms/om2 prior to ﬂight. Mass change for each sample was measured for the
ground facility eXposures. One of the RF plasma eXposed samples, and one of the directed beam eXposed
samples was then ﬂown on MISSE 2 and the remaining pair was ﬂown on MISSE 4 for comparison. The
directed beam eXposed samples have not been analyzed yet but the pre-ﬂight RF plasma eXposed samples
were eXposed again post-ﬂight in the RF plasma and the mass loss was recorded. This second eXposure
was performed in order to determine if the erosion would be the same as it had been in the same facility
pre-ﬂight, which would indicate if the sample had been damaged or not during ﬂight, and hence if defects
on the surface were those that were resident pre-ﬂight. The slopes of the mass change vs. ﬂuenoe plots
were then used to develop a correlation factor for predicting the durability of coated Kapton in a RF
plasma.

Results of these tests are shown in Figure 11 for the RF plasma eXposed samples. Comparison of the
slopes on the plots shows that there is good agreement between the pre-ﬂight and post-ﬂight mass loss
data. The correlation factor for RF ground-based eXposure to in-ﬂight eXposure for coated Kapton is
apprOXimately 18 i 2.13 This would indicate that eXposure in a ground-based RF plasma system for a
particular effective AO ﬂuenoe would produce the same amount of erosion for a coated Kapton sample
with apprOXimately a factor of 18 more ﬂuenoe eXposure in LEO. This knowledge can be used to more
accurately predict the performance of coated polymers such as coated Kapton in LEO through ground-
based eXposure testing.

4.4.2 Application ofMISSE 2 Results to Hubble Space T elescope (HST) Servicing Mission (4)

For HST SM4, it was necessary to determine if there would be a hazardous condition for astronauts
and the equipment if the double aluminized Kapton thermal insulation blanket covering the outside of
HST near the site of the proposed EVA would be damaged enough by exposure to the environment that
pieces of the blanket would break off during the EVA. A section of the insulation blanket used on HST
was exposed in an RF plasma to the point that the blanket began to break apart. In order to determine the
amount of real time this would represent in LEO, the MISSE Double SiOX Coated Kapton Ground to
Space Erosion Correlation Experiment correlation results were used comparing the RF plasma erosion for
coated Kapton to that in LEO on MISSE. The effective ﬂuence to make the blanket fail in the RF plasma
facility was multiplied by the RF facility correlation factor 18 to obtain the space ﬂuence that this would
represent. Results were able to show that the condition of the thermal blanket at the time of servicing
mission 4 would not pose a hazard for the EVA. Figure 12a and 12b show the thermal blanket after an
equivalent exposure of that near the servicing mission and at failure, respectively. The ﬂuence required to
make the blanket fail was much greater than that which HST would experience prior to the servicing
mission. These tests, which utilized the MISSE ﬂight data for ground-facility calibration, directly
impacted the decision to eliminate a planned SM4 EVA task (Bay 7 multilayer insulation coverage), thus
freeing time to perform other crucial tasks and potentially reducing critical EVA time.

(MISSE 2 & 4)

The A0 Undercutting Erosion SiOX Double-Coated Kapton H investigation is similar to the Double
SiOX-Coated Kapton Ground to Space Erosion Correlation Experiment, but the erosion characterization in
this experiment was based on undercut cavity growth in addition to mass loss, for both in-space AO
exposure (hyperthermal) and RF plasma AO exposure (thermal). There are a total of four samples of
0.001” (0.025 mm) thick Kapton H polyimide coated with z1300 angstroms of silicon dioxide by
Sheldahl, Inc. that were ﬂown on MISSE 2 and MISSE 4. Two of the four samples were exposed to an
A0 effective ﬂuence of 4.03 X 1021 atoms/cm2 in a RF plasma prior to ﬂight, and the undercut cavities
and mass loss were documented prior to ﬂight. One of the pre-eXposed samples and one unexposed
sample were ﬂown on MISSE 2, and one of the pre-eXposed samples and one of the unexposed samples
were ﬂown on MISSE 4. Mass and defect caVities (same caVities as documented pre-ﬂight) were
characterized after MISSE LEO AO exposure and the rate of undercut growth was determined.
Figure 13a shows a defect site in the protective coating of the MISSE 2 ﬂight sample. Figure 13b shows
an image of the shape of an undercut cavity post-ﬂight.

The growth of the undercut caVities was found to be signiﬁcantly smaller in LEO than in a RF plasma
asher environment. Figure 14 compares optical microscope photos of a pair of defect sites after two
different RF plasma AO ﬂuences. In most cases of pin window defect sites in the SiOX protective coating,
the AO exposure in space did not cause the pin windows to tear or open up in any manner which suggests
that the mass loss in the protected polymer is a rather uniform and linear progression with time. Results
of this experiment are reported by Snyder et a1.14

"19","4.6 Polymer Film Thermal Control (PFTC) & Gossamer Materials Experiments

(MISSE 1-4)

The main objective of the Glenn Polymer Film Thermal Control (PFTC) and Gossamer Materials
experiments on MISSE 1-4 was to assess radiation and temperature effects on optical and mechanical
properties of a variety of currently used and candidate thermal control materials. The materials included:
traditionally used Teﬂon® FEP and Kapton®, various thin polymer ﬁlm materials with and without
coatings for light-weight inﬂatable and deployable structures, and polymer ﬁlms with conductive coatings
for charge dissipation. The development of these experiments is fully described by Dever et al., in
reference 15 and is summarized here. Coatings are listed and deﬁned in Table 5 and samples are listed in
Table 6. For polymers with coatings, the material description indicates the various layers from the front
space-facing surface to the back surface in the following format: front surface coating(s) if used/
polymer/back surface coating(s). Also shown in Table 6 are the MISSE experiment PECs and whether
the samples were on a carrier surface which was AO-facing (ram facing) or non-AO facing (wake facing).
The various analyses that were planned for each material type are also indicated.

Tensile test samples were fabricated using a die manufactured according to specimen “Type V” under
the American Society for Testing and Materials (ASTM) Standard D-638. In order to occupy the least
area possible on the MISSE trays, tensile specimen holders were designed to allow the gage area of
samples to receive full space exposure while the grip ends were wrapped around mandrels (~48 mm
diameter) at the edges of the gage area and secured underneath the exposed gage area. Specimens for
optical property measurements were approximately 1” (2.54 cm) diameter. Results of optical properties
analysis and tensile testing of MISSE 1 and MISSE 2 specimens are summarized in the sections below.
Full details on the analyses of the MISSE 1 & 2 PFTC and Gossamer Materials experiments are provided
by Dever et al., 2006.16
4.6.1 Optical Results

Tables 7 and 8 show optical properties changes for the MISSE 2 PFTC (AO-facing) samples and
Gossamer Materials (non-AO-facing) samples, respectively. As shown in Table 7, the uncoated FEP/VDA
sample on the MISSE 2 A0 exposure tray experienced a signiﬁcant decrease in thermal emittance, a likely
result of AO erosion, which had caused a loss in FEP thickness for this non-coated sample. Among samples
on the AO-facing holder, the most signiﬁcant increase in solar absorptance was for the TOR LM material
(AOL ~O. 15), which had undergone signiﬁcant Visible darkening, as shown in Figure 15.

As shown in Table 8, polymer ﬁlms, Kapton HN, UpileX S, and CP1, all showed moderate increases
in solar absorptance (AOL ~0.03 to 0.05). Also, as shown in Table 8, all of these “non-AO” wake facing
polymer ﬁlms experienced signiﬁcant decreases in thermal emittance, the likely result of the AO erosion.
Whereas these samples were on wake-facing trays, unexpected ISS maneuvers caused brief ram-eXposure
of the wake-facing surfaces, resulting in exposure to some AO (z2 X 1020 atoms/cmz). Also, note that no
optical properties are given for the PEG sample which was completely eroded/degraded post-ﬂight.

of MISSE 3 & 4. Table 10 provides a list of the Glenn MISSE 3 & 4 experiments along with the on-orbit
orientation, the individual experiment objective and the number of samples. As stated before, the Glenn
MISSE 3 & 4 experiments were all passive experiments. The MISSE 3 & 4 trays were successfully ﬂown
and retrieved after 1 year of space exposure. Figure 17 shows on-orbit photos of both ram- and wake-
facing surfaces of MISSE 3 & 4 (Trays 1 and 2, respectively). Post-ﬂight sample documentation and
analyses have begun on some of these experiments.

The following MISSE 3 & 4 experiments were very similar to experiments ﬂown on MISSE 1 & 2,
and thus are described in the MISSE 1 & 2 Experiment sections above: Double SiOX-Coated Kapton
(Mass Loss), AO Undercutting Erosion (Undercut Cavities), AO Scattering Chamber, Spacecraft Silicone
Experiment, Polymer Film Thermal Control & Gossamer Materials Experiments (2 experiments) and
Stacked FEP Experiment (listed as part of the Polymer Film Thermal Control & Gossamer Materials
Experiments). The Electromagnetic Interference Shielding experiment was the only experiment ﬂown on
MISSE 3 & 4, which was not also ﬂown on MISSE 1 & 2. The following section describes this
experiment.

5.1 Graphite Epoxy Conductive Composite for Electromagnetic Interference (EMI)

Shielding (MISSE 3 & 4)

The objective of the Graphite Epoxy Conductive Composite for Electromagnetic Interference (EMI)
Shielding Experiment was to evaluate the EMI shielding effectiveness of an InstaShieldTM graphite ﬁber
conductive epoxy composite after exposure to the space environment. Four 1” (2.54 cm) diameter
samples were ﬂown on MISSE 3 & 4 to obtain ﬂight heritage. One sample was ﬂown on MISSE 3 Tray
1 (ram exposure), two were ﬂown on MISSE 3 Tray 2 (wake exposure), and one was ﬂown on MISSE 4
Tray 1 (ram exposure). The composites were composed of graphite ﬁbers purposely intercalated with
guest atoms to improve electrical conductivity and/or a polymer matrix purposely doped to provide a
matrix having high electrical conductivity. The conductive ﬁbers were developed at Glenn as part of an
internal research and development effort and the conductive polymer matrix was developed as part of a
Phase 11 Small Business Innovative Research effort with Triton Systems, Inc. Pre-ﬂight measurements
demonstrated excellent EMI shielding characteristics. The samples are currently awaiting post-ﬂight EMI
shielding characterization.

"24","6. MISSE 5 Experiments

MISSE 5 was placed in a zenith/nadir position on the 188 during the STS-114 mission, shortly after
retrieval of MISSE 1 & 2. Hence MISSE 5 was launched before MISSE 3 & 4, which were launched and
placed outside of 188 in August 2006 during the STS-121 mission. MISSE 5 contained two active and
one passive investigations: The FTSCE, an active experiment that tested the performance of 36 current
and advanced generation solar cells for use on future spacecraft; The active Second Prototype
Communication Satellite System (PCSat-2) that provided a communications system and tested the
Amateur Satellite Service off-the-shelf solution for telemetry command and control; and the passive
MISSE 5 Thermal Blanket Materials Experiment, which consisted of several individual experiments to
measure the degradation of more than 200 materials in the space environment. Figure 18 shows a pre-
ﬂight photograph of MISSE 5 and an on-orbit photo taken during the STS-114 mission. MISSE 5 was
exposed to the LEO space environment for 13 months. It was retrieved during the STS-115 mission in
September 2006. The ﬂight experiment was examined post-ﬂight at the Naval Research Laboratory in
October 2006. Figure 19 shows on-orbit and post-ﬂight photos of the Thermal Blanket Materials
Experiment.

NASA Glenn has four thin ﬁlm polymer durability experiments (with 105 samples) ﬂown as part of
the MISSE 5 Thermal Blanket Materials Experiment. These experiments are listed in Table 11 along
with the number of samples and the individual experiment objective. The Thermal Blanket Materials
Experiment consists of thin ﬁlm or ﬂexible samples that were taped and then stitched onto a Kapton
blanket. Post-ﬂight sample documentation and analyses have begun on the Glenn MISSE 5 experiments.

6.1 PEACE Polymers and Spacecraft Silicones Experiments (MISSE 5)

The MISSE 5 PEACE Polymers eXperiment consists of 49 - 0.5” (1.27 cm) X 1.5” (3.81) rectangular
samples, with a total of 53 different polymer materials, eXposed to the space environment on the eXterior
of 188 as part of the MISSE 5 Thermal Blanket EXperiment. The majority of samples were thin ﬁlm
ﬂexible polymers, as required. But, a few samples were rigid. Those samples were cut into small pieces
and sandwiched between two pieces of either Kapton H or Kapton HN using Y966 acrylic adhesive, and a
window was cut into the space eXposed Kapton cover providing a window for eXposure. Because the
samples were taped and then sewn on the Kapton blanket substrate, and hence mass loss was not possible,
all samples were dusted with ﬁne salt-spray particles to provide protection from A0 erosion, so that
recession depth measurements could be made post-ﬂight for By determination.

The MISSE 5 PEACE Polymers eXperiment contains the same set of polymers as the MISSE 2
eXperiment, with numerous additional polymers. While the MISSE 2 polymers were eXposed to high AO
ﬂuenee along with solar radiation eXposures, the MISSE 5 polymers were eXposed to low A0 with very
low solar radiation eXposure.17 Table 12 provides a comparison of the two eXperiments and their various
on-orbit eXposures. Hopefully, with the two eXperiments receiving different AO/solar radiation ratios
(provided in Table 12), the combined data will provide highly desired space-ﬂight information on the
synergistic effects of solar eXposure on the AO erosion of polymers. The MISSE 5 PEACE Polymers
eXperiment has been returned to Glenn for post-ﬂight analyses and post-ﬂight photo-doeumentation has
been conducted.

the data with other ﬂight data and ground-laboratory eXposed samples.

6.2 Polymer Film Thermal Control (PFTC) (MISSE 5)

The MISSE 5 PFTC materials eXperiment consists of 33 tensile specimens including many of the
same types of polymer ﬁlms eXposed in the Glenn MISSE 1-4 Gossamer Materials and PFTC

6.3 Team Cooperative Experiment (MISSE 5)

The Team Cooperative Fluorinated Polymers Experiment is a collaborative effort between NASA
Glenn, NASA Marshall Space Flight Center, Boeing Phantom Works and Montana State University. The
objective of this experiment was to determine the space environmental durability of ﬂuorinated polymers
in a nadir-faeing orientation. Speciﬁcally, it is desired to provide evidence of degradation mechanisms, to
relate degradation rates to structural features, to provide selected property measurements of the material
specimens, and to correlate the results with other ﬂight experiments. The experiment consists of 20 —
0.75” (1.91 cm) X 2.5” (6.35 cm) rectangular samples. The MISSE 5 Team Cooperative Experiment
samples are listed in Table 14. Each of the samples was salt-spray dusted in a 1A” wide strip at one end, to
allow for post-ﬂight recession depth measurements to be made. Recession rate measurements using
Kapton H indicate an A0 ﬂuenee exposure of ~1.8 X 1020 atoms/emz.17 Initial results of analyses can be
found in reference 17.

6.4 The Forward Technology Solar Cell Experiment (MISSE 5)

Glenn’s participation on MISSE 5 also included a substantial contribution to MISSE 5’s primary
experiment, the “Forward Technology Solar Cell Experiment” (FTSCE) built by the Naval Research
Lab.18 The goal of FTSCE was to rapidly put current and future generation space solar cells on orbit and
provide in-situ performance measurements for these technologies. Glenn designed and built the
measurement electronics and software for the FTSCE.19 Figure 20 shows the FTSCE measurement
electronics consisting of nine data acquisition (DAC) boards and a motherboard that managed
communication and data storage and measurement acquisition. Additionally, Glenn provided thin ﬁlm
solar cells and GaAS/Si cells for the experiment.20 Results for many of the solar cells are detailed in
reference.21’22

For MISSE 7 Glenn is designing a communications interface board to route and manage
communications 0f 20 active experiments. It provides a bi-directional RS485 bus to experiments and
routes data and commands Via the ISS 1553B low rate telemetry bus to and from the ground for both 7A
and 7B. Glenn also has four active experiments on MISSE 7A consisting of AO ﬂuence monitors
(discussed in Section 8.2), a Makel hydrogen/oxygen sensor, a demonstration of SiC Junction Field Effect
Transistors (JFETs) designed for low-power analog and digital circuits in extreme environments, and a re-
ﬂight of the MISSE 5 FTSCE, called FTSCE-II 0n MISSE 7A.

"29","7.1 Stressed PEACE Polymers Experiment (MISSE 6A)

Several retrieved MISSE l & 2 samples appeared to have preferentially eroded at high stress
locations; an example of this is observed in several of the tensile samples in the Glenn PFTC & Gossamer
Materials Experiments. Therefore, the objective of the Stressed PEACE Polymers Experiment is to
compare the AO Ey of stressed and non-stressed polymers to determine if the AO erosion rate is
dependent upon stress while in LEO. This experiment utilizes 2 passive experiment trays that each hold
15 — l” (2.54 cm) square samples. Stressed sample holders were designed to ﬁt into the 2.54 cm square
area. One of the stressed sample holders loaded with a ﬂight sample is shown in Figure 22. The
experiment includes 11 stressed/non-stressed polymer pairs (PTFE, FEP, UpileX-S, CPI, Kapton CB,
Kapton XC, Kapton E, Kapton H, Mylar A, low oxygen PE, and DC 93-500 silicone) and 4 polymer
samples that were partially or completely eroded through all sample layers during the MISSE 2 PEACE
Polymers experiment (high temperature polyimide resin PMR-l5, PEI, PBI, ADC). The samples for
erosion yield were thin ﬁlm polymers (1 - 20 mils 0r 0.0254 - 0.508 mm thick) and were stacked to
survive a multiple year mission (ADC was 47 mils or 1.2 mm thick). The total thickness of the stressed
samples was chosen to be 20 mils (0.508 mm), so that the surface ﬂexural stress on each sample would be
the same. The samples for By will be characterized based on pre-ﬂight and post-ﬂight mass. Also
included in this experiment are 2 passive solar cells with silicone and POSS coatings being evaluated for
short duration or CEV-type missions, a Kapton H AO ﬂuence witness sample and an Atomic Oxygen
Pinhole Camera. The pinhole camera will document the arrival direction of AO during the mission.
Atomic oxygen will pass through an oriﬁce in a thin aluminum plate and impinge upon a Kapton H disk.
The Kapton H disk will have sodium chloride salt particles on it to allow proﬁlometry 0f the eroded
Kapton surface to measure the amount of ﬂuence in any particular direction. A pre-ﬂight photograph of
the Stressed PEACE Polymers Experiment is provided in Figure 23.

7.2 Polymer Film Tensile Experiment (MISSE 6A & 6B)

The MISSE 6 Polymer Film Tensile Experiment will measure radiation induced tensile failure of
stressed and unstressed thin ﬁlm polymer tensile samples. Forty-one tensile specimens were installed ﬂat
in samples holders. Twenty-nine samples were loaded with no tension and 10 samples were installed
with an applied stress through a spring-loading mechanism. Examples of samples loaded under these
stressed and non-stressed conditions are shown in Figure 24. Two additional samples were pulled tight
when loaded. The polymer ﬁlm samples in these experiments included Kapton HN, Kapton E, Kapton
XC, Teﬂon FEP, CPI and DC 93-500 silicone. The spring-loaded samples were mounted with stresses
that represent the functional stresses expected on the J ames Webb Space Telescope (JWST) sunshield and
potential stresses on solar sails. Depending on the application being studied, backside or front

surface aluminum coatings were applied and/or other protective coatings, such as SiOX-PTFE,

were included. The resistance across the length of three samples is actively monitored on-orbit

to document tensile failure versus exposure. Seven stressed and 17 unstressed samples are
mounted on MISSE 6A Tray 2 (wake facing) and are being exposed to solar radiation with
minimal AO. Three stressed, 12 unstressed and 2 tightly pulled samples are mounted on MISSE
6B Tray 1 (ram facing) and are being exposed to A0 and solar radiation.

7.3 Indium Tin Oxide (ITO) Degradation Experiment (MISSE 6A & 6B)

The purpose of the ITO Degradation Experiment is to investigate the effects of space solar exposure
on optical and electrical properties of transparent conductive ITO coatings. Two experiment ﬁxtures will
be included on MISSE 6; one is located on MISSE 6A Tray 2 (wake facing) receiving solar radiation with
minimal A0, and one is located in MISSE 6B Tray 1 (ram facing) receiving A0 and solar radiation.
These experiments will actively measure changes in transmittance of quartz with and without an ITO
coating and will actively monitor the resistance of the ITO coating over time on-orbit. Figure 2521 shows
an exploded drawing of the experiment and Figure 25b is a pre-ﬂight photograph showing a top View of
one of the experiment ﬁxtures.

7.4 Cermet Coatings and Thermal Control Paints Experiment (MISSE 6A & 6B)

The objective of the Cermet Coatings and Thermal Control Paints Experiment is to evaluate the in-
spaoe durability of newly developed oermet coatings and thermal control paints. It is an active
experiment with two sets of four samples (each 0.5” (1.27 cm) in diameter). One set is being ﬂown on
the wake side of 6A and the second is being ﬂown on the ram side of 6B. The oermet coatings (2 samples
per set) were developed originally for solar Stirling space power systems and may have terrestrial
applications.” One sample has a titanium and aluminum oxide oermet coating. The second sample has a
molybdenum and aluminum oxide oermet coating. The thermal control paints (2 samples per set) are
described in the New Thermal Control Paints Experiments section (Section 7.8). These thermal control
paints were developed under the Small Business Innovative Research (SBIR) Phase II entitled “Next
Generation Advanced Binder Chemistries for High Performance, Environmentally Durable Thermal
Control Material Systems”. In this SBIR effort, thermal control coating development was based on

were applied to thermally isolated nickel disks that are each instrumented With a thermocouple and the
temperature data Will be stored in on-board data loggers. A pre-ﬂight photograph of one set of samples is
shown in Figure 26.

7.5 Atomic Oxygen Fluence Monitor (MISSE 6B)

A Glenn developed Atomic Oxygen Fluenoe Monitor is being ﬂown on the ram side of MISSE 6B to
actively measure the AO ﬂuenoe accumulated With time. The sensor utilizes two wedge shaped sheets of
pyrolytic graphite, Which erode with A0 exposure allowing sunlight to increasingly enter into a
photodiode, as shown in Figure 27. The short circuit current from a photodiode under two pyrolytic
graphite wedges is compared the short circuit current from an identical photodiode, Which is exposed to
unobstructed sunlight in the Glenn ITO experiment to measure the erosion of the graphite. Because the
erosion yield of pyrolytic graphite is known to be 4.15 X 10'25 cm3/atom from MISSE 26’7 the AO ﬂuenoe
can be measured by knowing the ratio of short circuit currents. One signiﬁcant advantage of this
measurement technique is that the geometry of the pyrolytic graphite produces a linear dependence upon
AO ﬂuenoe using a material With a well characterized LEO erosion yield. A pre-ﬂight photo of the
Atomic Oxygen Fluenoe Monitor is provided in Figure 28.

7.6 Scattered Space Atomic Oxygen Experiment (SSAOE) (MISSE 6B)

The objective of the SSAOE is to actively measure direct ram and scattered AO erosion in LEO, and
to passively measure the angular distribution and relative erosion rate of LEO ram AO scattered from an
inclined angle. The SSAOE is being ﬂown on the ram side of MISSE 6B. To measure, and thus be able
to compare direct ram and scattered AO erosion, this experiment compares the in-situ erosion of opaque
diamond-like carbon (DLC) exposed to direct ram A0 to DLC exposed to only thermally accommodated
scattered space A0. The scattered AO experiment is set inside a cylindrical scattering chamber Where
ram AO scatters off a fused silica slide tilted at a 45° angle from the incoming ﬂux. Photodiodes are
placed behind DLC coated fused silica slides and the By of direct ram and scattered AO Will be
determined by increases in the transmittance of light through the eroded DLC coatings. The light sources
for the ram and scattered experiments are the sun and a light bulb, respectively. Unooated fused silica
covered photodiodes are placed next to the DLC-ooated fused silica covered photodiodes for light
calibration. To passively measure the angular distribution of LEO ram AO scattered from an inclined
angle, salt-dusted Kapton H polyimide lines a second passive cylindrical scattering chamber, again With a
fused silica slide set at a 450 angle. From this chamber the effective Ey of Kapton H Will be determined
as a function of ejection angle. A schematic diagram of the SSAOE is provided in Figure 29. Pre-ﬂight
photos of the inside of the SSAOE are provided in Figure 30. This experiment also includes 8 ram-faoing
small passive samples for By determination (Kapton H, CV-1144 silicone, polyphaphazene, oarborane-
siloxane, FEP, Teﬂon AF-1600, HRG-3/AB (epoxy-silane), HRG-3/AO (epoxy-silane)).

"33","7.7 Low Impact Docking System (LIDS) Seals for Crew Exploration Vehicle (CEV)

(MISSE 6B)

The objective of the LIDS Seals for CEV experiment is to expose three candidate elastomers t0 the
space environment in LEO to evaluate their applicability as material for the primary mating interface seal
for the LIDS. The mating interface seal, shown in Figure 31, is a mission critical, life support subsystem.
Leakage through this interface seal results in an unrecoverable loss of breathable air for astronauts.
Understanding the durability of materials that comprise LIDS seals is critical to fulﬁlling proposed
Constellation missions. The materials used between mating spacecraft to help seal in cabin air Will be
exposed to the space environment prior to docking. The A0, radiation, and meteoroid and debris impacts
found in space have been shown to damage seal materials. Individual space environments can be
simulated on Earth. However, in-space testing is an essential part of assessing the synergistic effects of
combined exposures to the LEO environment in the development of durable seal materials. The LIDS
experiment on MISSE 6B utilizes two types of hardware, specimen holder A and specimen holder B.
Specimen holder A, shown in Figure 32a, holds 15 o-ring samples and is being ﬂown on both the ram and
wake sides of 6B. These trays of samples Will be used to evaluate the effects of the combined space
environment on candidate seal materials, including leakage rate, weight, durometer & dimensional
changes. Specimen holder B, shown in Figures 32b and 32c, holds 1 set of two o-rings under
compression. A total 0f 20 sets of samples are being ﬂown on the wake side of 6B to evaluate the seal-
on-seal adhesion forces (pre & post-ﬁght) to assess effect of long term engagement in the space
environment.

"34","7.8 New Thermal Control Paints Experiments (MISSE 6B & 7B)

The objectives of the MISSE 6 & 7 New Thermal Control Paints Experiments are to evaluate the in-
spaoe durability of newly developed thermal oontrol paints. The MISSE 6 New Thermal Control Paints
Experiment is a passive experiment ﬂown on the wake side of MISSE 6B. It consists of 15 — 1” square
(2.54 cm) samples. The MISSE 7 Thermal Control Paints Experiment is similar to the MISSE 6 Cermet
Coatings and Thermal Control Paints Experiment. It is an active experiment consisting of two sets of four
samples each 0.5” (1.27 cm) in diameter. One set of samples will be ﬂown on the ram side of 7B, and the
second will be ﬂown on the wake side of 7B. The coatings are applied to thermally isolated nickel disks.
In the 7B experiment each sample is instrumented with a temperature transducer and the temperature data
will be sent through a communications interface to the ISS and then back to Earth by telemetry. The New
Thermal Control Paints Experiment includes new thermal oontrol paints that are being developed for light
weight composite radiators for Fission Surface Power applications.24

The New Thermal Control Paints Experiments thermal oontrol paint technology is derived from two
Phase 11 Small Business Innovative Research (SBIR) investments: 1) next generation thermal oontrol paint
matrix materials based on lithium silicate chemistry, and 2) next generation thermal oontrol paint pigment
materials based on miorogel encapsulation.25 The ﬁrst effort focused on Zn assisted lithium alumino silicate
nano-oluster binders that provided interconnecting channels as percolating paths for electrical conductivity.
The goal was to provide increased space radiation stability by creating binders that prevent surface charging
and deep charging Via percolating paths and appropriate secondary emission mechanisms for the desired
reliability in high radiation environments. The nano-olusters in the matrix materials also offered the
advantage of having a negative coefﬁcient of thermal expansion (CTE), which facilitates CTE-tailoring to
match the paint to the underlying composite. The second effort, developed under SBIR Phase II entitled
“Robust Engineered Thermal Control Material Systems for Crew Exploration Vehicle (CEV) and
Prometheus Needs” focused on developing paciﬁed beta alumina coated with lithium silicate nanoolusters
suitable for plasma spraying. The goal was to develop new thermal oontrol material systems which can be
dielectrioally engineered, tailored for CTE matching to composite substrates, and which are durable to space
radiation exposure at elevated operating temperatures up to 600 OC.

The passive MISSE 6B Thermal Control Paints Experiment oontains thermal oontrol material systems
developed in the ﬁrst SBIR effort (with Zn assisted lithium alumino silicate nano-oluster binders). In this
experiment, the Zn assisted lithium alumino silicate nano-oluster binders that provided interconnecting
channels were applied to aluminum and composite samples, all utilizing a heritage zinc oxide pigment.
Some samples were prepared by conventional water spraying while others were prepared by plasma
spraying. Selected samples were prepared having the heritage zinc oxide pigment encapsulated in glass-
frit. All samples were evaluated before ﬂight for their optical properties and any changes in optical
properties will be documented by post-ﬂight optical properties characterization. A pre-ﬂight photograph
of the MISSE 6B New Thermal Control Paints Experiment is shown in Figure 33. The MISSE 7B active

"35","7.9 Polymer Strain Experiment (MISSE 6B)

One of the observations of degraded polymers of retrieved MISSE l & 2 ﬂight trays was
environmentally induced shrinkage that contributes to polymer cracking and/or curling. This shrinking,
cracking and curling phenomenon was observed in-spaoe in the aluminized-Teﬂon FEP multilayer
insulation covering the HST. On Hubble, the magnitude of cracks induced in the Teﬂon insulation has
been observed to be on the order of meters in length. Curling of cracked insulation through
environmental induced surface strain of the Teﬂon has allowed the underlying components to be directly
exposed to the space environment; hence the insulation is no longer functioning properly for thermal
control. The objective of the MISSE 6 Polymer Strain Experiment, being ﬂown on the wake side of
MISSE 6B, is to measure radiation and thermal exposure-indueed strain in thin ﬁlm polymers as a
function of exposure time in LEO.

In the Polymer Strain Experiment siX long thin opaque rectangular polymer ﬁlm samples are
positioned in the hardware such that one end of the polymer sample is held securely in place, While the
other end is left unattached and hence free to shrink or expand. The free end is positioned inside one end
of the hardware that contains a small light emitting diode (LED) and a photodiode, placed above and
below the free end of the sample, respectively, as shown in Figure 34. As the polymer sample shrinks (or
expands) due to environmentally induced interactions, the photodiode short circuit current Will change in
proportion to the strain of the sample. Small gauge Wires lay over the polymer ﬁlm samples to keep the
samples from curling on-orbit. The experiment has been calibrated and can measure length changes as
small as ~ 1%. Table 16 lists the thin ﬁlm samples along With their mission relevance. A pre-ﬂight
photograph of the Polymer Strain Experiment is provided in Figure 35.

8.1 Zenith Polymers Experiment (MISSE 7A)
The objective of the Zenith Polymers Experiment is to determine the effect of solar exposure on the
AO Ey of ﬂuoropolymers under high solar/low AO exposure. This passive experiment will be ﬂown in
the zenith facing orientation as part of MISSE 7A, and includes 15 - 1” (2.54 cm) square samples. Seven
different ﬂuoropolymers: (PTFE, FEP, CTFE (Kel-f), ETFE (Tefzel), PVDF (Kynar), ECTFE (Halar) and
PVF (clear Tedlar), are being ﬂown along with low oxygen PE. These polymers were ﬂown as part of the
MISSE 2 and MISSE 5 PEACE Polymers experiments, and therefore the By for the same polymers under
3 different LEO solar/AO exposures should provide data on whether or not there is a synergistic effect of
solar radiation on the AO erosion, as is currently being debated in the space environmental durability
community. Samples of Al-FEP and silvered-Teﬂon FEP (Ag-FEP) are also being ﬂown to determine the
effect of metallization on AO By, and to characterize changes in optical properties. A Kapton H witness
sample will be included for A0 ﬂuenoe characterization.
Four additional samples are included in the Zenith Polymers Experiment: JWST sunshield material
(Si/2 mil Kapton E/VDA), Orion LIDS seal sample and two barrier coating samples. The Orion LIDS
seal sample will include four small o-rings mounted together in a 1” (2.54 cm) area. The o-rings will be
comprised of 2 types of materials: Parker 80383-70 and Esterline ELA-SA-401. These four zenith facing
o-rings are part of the LIDS Seals for CEV experiment. The barrier coating samples include two samples
of coated Teﬂon FEP to evaluate A0 and VUV barrier coatings. One sample is sectioned in half with two

oxygen atoms, but will transmit VUV light. The coating should also act as a barrier to the escape of
volatile reaction products. The second sample is a multilayer coated FEP sample. The coating consists of
a thin layer (~30 nm) of Ti02 on top of a thinner layer (~10 nm) of A1203. This multilayer coating should
protect against A0 and VUV light. These samples will be compared with an identical Ti02
(~30 nm)/A1203 (~10 nm) coated FEP sample being ﬂown in the ram facing direction as part of the
MISSE 7B Polymers Experiment (see Section 8.4).

8.2 Atomic Oxygen Fluence Monitor (MISSE 7A & 7B)

Four Glenn Atomic Oxygen Fluenoe Monitors are being ﬂown on MISSE 7 to actively measure the
cumulative AO ﬂuence arriving at the surface of the PEC. Monitors will be positioned on each of the
4 PEC surfaces (7A zenith & nadir and 7B ram & wake). Whereas the MISSE 6 A0 ﬂuence monitor uses
reference photodiodes from other experiments to compare the output from the pyrolytio graphite
photodiode, the MISSE 7 ﬂuence monitor was designed with its own reference photodiode next to the
pyrolytio graphite photodiode. The geometry is almost identical for each MISSE 7 A0 ﬂuence monitor
diode, which should result in more accurate ﬂuence versus time data. A photograph of a MISSE 7 A0
ﬂuence monitor is provided in Figure 36.

8.3 Low Impact Docking System (LIDS) Seals for Crew Exploration Vehicle (CEV)

(MISSE 7A & 7B)

The objective of the MISSE 7 LIDS Seals for CEV experiment is similar to MISSE 6, namely to
characterize the performance of candidate seal materials when subjected to the synergistic effects of the
space environment in LEO. The materials used between mating spacecraft to help seal in cabin air will be
exposed to the space environment prior to docking. Figure 37 shows the specimen holder that will be
utilized on MISSE 7B, and will be ﬂown on both the ram and wake sides of MISSE 7B. The differences
between the MISSE 6 and 7 seals experiments are as follows: 1) MISSE 6 is ﬂying as-reoeived material
and MISSE 7B will ﬂy 10 seals that have received the same AO pre-treatment planned for LIDS seal, 2)
188 side of the LIDS will be an aluminum ﬂange and hence MISSE 7B will test 188 aluminum with the
correct surface coatings and ﬁnishes (12 samples), and 3) other seal applications employ RTV adhesives,
therefore MISSE 7B will include one of these adhesives, thus helping with its ﬂight qualiﬁcation (6
samples). Figure 37 shows only 1 large RTV sample, but 3 samples will be ﬂown on each holder. Kapton
H AO ﬂuence samples are also included in each holder (2 samples). As mentioned previously, the LIDS
Seals for CEV experiment includes 4 small o-rings that will receive zenith exposure as part of the MISSE
7A Zenith Polymers Experiment.

The MISSE 7B Polymers Experiment includes a variety of passive samples to investigate the effects
of A0 and radiation (ram samples) or radiation with minimal AO (wake samples). This experiment
includes 29 samples: 26 on the ram side of 7B and 3 on the wake side of 7B. Table 18 provides a list of
each of the MISSE 7B Polymers Experiment samples along with the individual sample objectives, the
sample sizes and the on-orbit orientations. The Polymers Experiment is a collaborative effort with
researchers from the Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency (JAXA), Towson University, Montana State
University, ManTeoh SRS Tech., Inc., ATK, NASA Langley Research Center (LaRC), the National
Institute of Aerospace, and Hathaway Brown School. Several of the samples are being oo-investigated
with Hathaway Brown School and Towson University as educational outreach efforts.

The MISSE 7B AO Scattering Chamber, ﬂown as part of the MISSE 7B Polymers Experiment, will
differ from the MISSE 2 and MISSE 4 A0 Scattering Chamber experiments in that scattering in the 7B
experiment will be off an aluminum surface that provides an angle of attack 300 from normal, rather than
00 from normal. The 300 tilted base will provide information on the angular distribution of scattered A0
with respect to incident angle.

Included in the MISSE 7B Polymers Experiment are several Exploration Mission relevant samples.
ATK Orion UltraFleX passive samples are being ﬂown to validate the survivability in the LEO
environment of key UltraFleX solar array blanket materials. Two 1.5” samples are being ﬂown: one
sample composed of front side blanket assembly materials, and one sample composed of backside blanket
assembly materials. An ATK urethane/Veotran mesh sample will also be included for durability
assessment. Also being ﬂown are POSS coated Kapton HN samples from NASA LaRC/National Institute
of Aerospace. These samples are being investigated for lunar dust mitigation applications.

8.5 Flexural Stress Effects Experiment (MISSE 7B)

The objective of the MISSE 7B Flexural Stress Effects Experiment is to examine the role of surface
tensile ﬂexural stress on space environment induced polymer cracking. The experiment includes two sets
of 12 polymer thin ﬁlm samples wrapped around mandrels of two different diameters (see Figure 38).
The samples, as shown in Fig. 38b from left to right, are: DC 93-500 silicone (1), SiOX/Kapton HN (1),
Kapton HN/VDA (1), FEP/VDA (2), CPl/VDA (1), VDA/CPl (1), Si/Kapton E/VDA/Inoonel/VDA (3)
and Kapton XC (2). The mandrel diameters are 0.25” (0.635 cm) and 0.375” (0.953 cm). The Flexural
Stress Effects Experiment will be ﬂown on the wake side of MISSE 7B. This experiment includes the
same sample materials (and of the same thickness) ﬂown as part of MISSE 6 Polymer Film Tensile
Experiment. Between the two experiments, performance of ﬂat and unstressed ﬁlms can be compared
with performance of tensile stressed and ﬂexural stressed ﬁlms.

8.6 New Thermal Control Paints Experiment (MISSE 7B)

The active MISSE 7B New Thermal Control Paints Experiment is summarized along with the
MISSE 6 New Thermal Control Paints Experiment in Section 7.8 above.

8.7 Spacesuit Fabrics Exposure Experiment (MISSE 7B)

The Spacesuit Fabrics Exposure Experiment is a passive experiment to ﬂy on the wake side of
MISSE 7B. The objective is to evaluate the long term space exposure durability of state-of—the-art
orthofabrios and Apollo era fabrics, both pristine and damaged by dust abrasion. Spacesuits for use at a
future lunar outpost are envisioned to be used for a much longer time than those for Apollo. Indeed, one
concept is to have the spacesuits reside outside the lunar habitat and have the astronauts climb in through

"
"39","the back of the spacesuit. In such a case, the suit itself would be exposed to the ultraviolet (UV) radiation
environment for a long time, even When not in use. It is well known that lunar dust is a serious issue.
Figure 39 shows Apollo 12 astronaut Alan Bean in a heavily dust covered spacesuit. Therefore, there is a
concern of UV radiation degradation of both pristine, and dust abraded, spacesuit fabrics.

A total of siX 0.47” (12 mm) square fabric samples will be ﬂown. Three state-of—the-art orthofabrics
will be ﬂown, including one pristine sample, one lightly dust damaged sample, and one heavily dust
damaged sample. The dust damaged samples will be abraded with lunar simulant. Three Apollo era
fabrics will be ﬂown, including one pristine sample, one lightly dust damaged sample (lunar simulant),
and one sample damaged by actual lunar dust (a section of the left knee of Alan Bean’s Apollo 12
spacesuit). The fabric samples were documented photographically, and by both atomic force microscopy
(AFM) and scanning electron microscopy (SEM), prior to ﬂight. These techniques were chosen because
they are non-destructive analysis techniques. Upon return, the coupons will be re-photographed and re-
submitted for AFM and SEM analyses to identify and evaluate the effect of long term UV radiation upon
the fabric. A photograph of the Spacesuit Fabrics Exposure Experiment is provided in Figure 40.

"41","9. Summary and Conclusions
This paper introduces space environmental durability issues in LEO and provides an overview of
Glenn’s 39 passive and active MISSE 1-7 materials ﬂight experiments. The Glenn MISSE experiments
address AO effects such as erosion and undercutting of polymers, AO scattering, stress effects on AO
erosion, and in-situ AO ﬂuenoe monitoring. Several experiments address solar radiation effects such as
radiation induced polymer shrinkage, stress effects on radiation degradation of polymers, and radiation
degradation of ITO coatings and spacesuit fabrics. Experiments also address combined A0 and solar
radiation effects on thermal control ﬁlms, paints and oermet coatings. Experiments With Orion CEV seals

and UltraFleX solar array materials are also being ﬂown. Several experiments, such as the MISSE 2 & 4

Double SiOX-Coated Kapton Ground to Space Erosion Correlation Experiments were designed to provide

ground-faoility to in-spaoe calibration data thus enabling more accurate in-spaoe performance predictions

based on ground-laboratory testing. Numerous experiments, such as the MISSE 6A Stressed PEACE

Polymers and the MISSE 6B Polymer Strain Experiment were designed based on observations of

materials damage from prior retrieved MISSE experiments. The MISSE 2 PEACE Polymers experiment

contains the Widest variety of well-dooumented polymers exposed to identical long duration LEO AO
conditions, and provides AO Ey data for 39 different polymers. Results from Glenn MISSE experiments
have impacted spacecraft missions, such as the HST SM4 and Exploration Mission spacecraft such as

COTS.

14. ABSTRACT
NASA Glenn Research Center (Glenn) has 39 individual materials ﬂight experiments (>540 samples) ﬂown as part of the Materials
International Space Station Experiment (MISSE) to address long duration environmental durability of spacecraft materials in low Earth orbit
(LEO). MISSE is a series of materials ﬂight experiments consisting of trays, called Passive Experiment Carriers (PECs) that are exposed to
the space environment on the exterior of the International Space Station (188). MISSE 1-5 have been successfully ﬂown and retrieved and
were exposed to the space environment from one to four years. MISSE 6A & 6B were deployed during the STS-123 shuttle mission in
March 2008, and MISSE 7A & 7B are being prepared for launch in 2009. The Glenn MISSE experiments address atomic oxygen (A0)
effects such as erosion and undercutting of polymers, AO scattering, stress effects on AO erosion, and in-situ AO ﬂuence monitoring.
Experiments also address solar radiation effects such as radiation induced polymer shrinkage, stress effects on radiation degradation of
polymers, and radiation degradation of indium tin oxide (ITO) coatings and spacesuit fabrics. Additional experiments address combined A0
and solar radiation effects on thermal control films, paints and cerrnet coatings. Experiments with Orion Crew Exploration Vehicle (CEV)
seals and UltraFleX solar array materials are also being ﬂown. Several experiments were designed to provide ground-facility to in-space
calibration data thus enabling more accurate in-space performance predictions based on ground-laboratory testing. This paper provides an
overview of Glenn’s MISSE 1-7 ﬂight experiments along with a summary of results from Glenn’s MISSE 1 & 2 experiments.
