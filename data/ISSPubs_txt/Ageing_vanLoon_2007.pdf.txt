F ig. 2A: The Soyuz manned spacecraft consists of three main parts, the utility landing and instrument - assembly modules. Daring launch and
descent the three person crew is seated in the landing module, known by its Russian acronym as ""SA "", which is the only section of the vehicle,
returning to Earth. It contains three personally contoured coaches where the cosmonauts reclinefor ascent, descent and landing. Seats are
facing controls and displays. The utility or habitation section of the Soyuz spacecraft (B0), carries crucial life-sapport systems for the crew,
including toilet and water supplies. It also provides extra habitation room during the ﬂight and can serve as an airlockfor space walks. In
most missions, the front end of the habitation section is equipped with docking system. The instrument module or service module of the Soyuz
spacecraft, known by its Russian acronym as FAQ, or Priborno-Agregatniy Otsek, in its turn is subdivided into three main sections:
Intermediate compartment, Instrumentation compartment, P0, and Propulsion compartment, A0. Daring launch, experimentfacilities such as
Aquarius ana’ Kabik were located in the utility module. The Soyuz couples with the utility module to ISS. Daring descent, at 2 hrs. 29 min.
before landing, both the utility and the instrament-assembly modules are decoupled from the landing module.

Station (ISS). This has been done by identifying new food
items (typical, traditional food) from the Italian Lazio
region, served in a tray-container as a meal on the ISS.
A. Dominoni, Spin Design, Politecnico GOAL Technology The aim of the GOAL experiment is to increase astronaut
di Milano, Milan (IT) Demonstration comfort and efficiency by improving the psychological
and physiological well being by means of garment wear-
ability, aesthetics, colours, thermal stability and bodily
hygiene on board the ISS.
V. Zolesi, Kayser Italia (IT) HAND POSTURE Human Physiology This experiment has made use of hardware for measur-
ANALYZER ing handgrip and pinch forces, bending angles on indi
vidual fingers, and determination of the linear and angu-
lar motion, rotation and acceleration of the hand and
forearm in all directions.
A. D’Amico, Univ. Roma Tor HEART BEAT Technology The Heart Beat Monitoring experiment aims at testing the
Vergata, Rome (IT) MONITORING Demonstration development of ‘intelligent’ clothing for astronauts, capa-
ble of monitoring their vital functions using both wireless
and non-wireless devices to allow free movement of astro
nauts in a closed orbiting environment.
R. Battiston, INFN Sezione Perugia, LAZIO Technology The objectives of the LAZIO experiment are:
Perugia (IT) Demonstration
- To detect and identify cosmic rays with high precision
tracking capability.
- To determine the relation of cosmic rays to the so—called
Light Flash phenomenon in astronauts. Light Flashes
consist of unexpected visual phenomena caused by the
interaction of cosmic rays with the eyes of the astronaut.
- To study the effect of different shielding materials in
reducing the radiation environment.

F. Canganella, Université della Tuscia, MICROSPACE Microbiology ”Different microbial strains will be flown to the ISS in

Viterbo (IT) order to study the effect that space radiation and the
weightless environmental conditions onboard the ISS
have on the cultures. The microbial strains selected for
the experiment are non hazardous, of environmental
origin, and some of them (Saccharomyces cerevisiae,
Escherichia coli, Enterococcus faecium, Lactobacillus
acidophilus) are commonly hosted by humans.

response to microgravity exposure.

D. Santucci. ISS, Rome (IT) NERVE GROWTH Human Physiology The purpose of this experiment is to perform research on

FACTOR stress responses related to astronauts before, during and
after a space mission. To this end the experiment will
analyse blood samples pre-flight and post—flight and
saliva samples pre-, during and post-flight for the
presence of Nerve Growth Factor (NGF).

M. Casucci, Azimuth Roma (IT) SEEDLINGS Education Aims to evaluate the feasibility of producing vegetable
sprouts in space for food purposes and to study the
influence of weightlessness on germination, growth and
the nutritional quality of sprouts.

G. Colla, Université della Tuscia, SPACE BEANS Education Aims to involve and interest children in space science to

Viterbo (IT) help with the continuous exploitation of space technology
and its application to every day life on Earth.

M. Porfilio, University of Rome SPQR Technology This experiment proposes the test of a ground-based

imaging “La Sapienza”, Rome (IT) Demonstration system, using special optics and image processing, to
determine the feasibility of developing an operational
system.

S. Ijsselstein, ESA—ESTEC, VIDEO-3 Education This experiment involves filming two sets of small

Noordwijk (NL) spheres composed of different materials that charge with
opposite polarities to each other. These spheres are con-
tained within a polycarbonate cube container. Once
charged, the spheres will assemble themselves into
ordered structures.

V. Zolesi, Kayser Italia S.r.|, Livorno (IT) VINO Technology The aim of the VINO experiment is to test the survival

Demonstration and growth in space of tendril grafts from vines coming
from Sassicaia vineyards in Tuscany (IT).

SUBJECTIVE visceral receptor performance within an environment,

VERTICAL which rules out possible bias due to visual and
gravitational inputs.
