ABSTRACT

Bone marrow cells were isolated from the humerii 0f C57BL/6J mice following a 13-day ﬂight
011 the space shuttle, Space Transportation System (STS)-118 to determine how space ﬂight
affected differentiation of cells in the granulocytie lineage. We used ﬂow cytometry to assess
the expression of molecules that deﬁne the maturation/aetivation state of cells in the granulocytie
lineage 011 three bone marrow cell subpopulations. These molecules included Ly6C, CD1 1b,
CD31 (PECAM-l), Ly6G (Gr-l), F4/80, CD44 and e-Fos. The three subpopulations were small
agranular cells (R1), larger granular cells (R2) which were mostly neutrophils and very large,
very granular cells (R3) which had properties of macrophages. Although there were 110
composite phenotypie differences between total bone marrow cells isolated from Flight- and
Ground-eontrol mice, there were subpopulation differences in Ly6C (R1 and R3), CD1 1b (R2),
CD31 (R1, R2 and R3), Ly6G (R3), F4/80 (R3), CD44 high (R3), and e-Fos (R1,R2 and R3). In
particular, the elevation of CD1 1b in the R2 subpopulation suggests neutrophil activation in
response to landing. In addition, decreases in Ly6C, e-Fos, CD44high and Ly6G and an increase
in F4/ 80 suggest that the cells in the bone marrow R3 subpopulation of space ﬂight mice were
more differentiated compared to the ground controls. The presence of more differentiated cells
may not pose an immediate risk to immune resistance. However, the reduction in less
differentiated cells may forbode future consequences to macrophage production and host
defenses. This is of particular importance to considerations of future long-term space ﬂights.

INTRODUCTION

Bone marrow is a complex mioroenvironment that is necessary for the generation of red
and white blood cells (hematopoiesis) in adult animals (1, 58, 61). This organ can be disrupted
by numerous factors including stress, bone changes, alterations in circadian rhythm and
irradiation (4, 35, 44, 45); all of which occur during space ﬂight. Therefore, it is not surprising
that space ﬂight decreased the number of bone marrow-derived colony forming units (CFU-M or
CFU-GM) during some space ﬂights (26, 49, 50, 57). Space ﬂight also has had an impact on
monocytes; cells that have recently emerged from the bone marrow. The number of monocytes
in circulation declined (53) and some lacked the expression of insulin growth factor receptors
(34). A mouse model used to simulate some of the physiological changes associated with space
ﬂight, antiorthostatio suspension (56), also diminished the number of macrophage progenitor
cells (CFU-M) in the bone marrow (6-8, 19, 20, 49). This strengthens the hypothesis that
physiological changes that occur in response to space ﬂight affect bone marrow cells.

Although many space ﬂights have been done using rats, only STS-108 addressed the
impact of space ﬂight on immune parameters in adult mice. Indeed, there was a decrease in the
number and percentage of blast cells and an increase in the number of CD34+ cells in the bone
marrow in ﬂight animals assessed after the landing of STS-108 (41). However, there were no
differences in the numbers of mature granulocytes or monocytes in the bone marrow of those
same animals (41).

Several countries are preparing for space travel in the future (29, 40). Given the
importance of bone marrow to the maintenance of host red and white blood cell populations,

additional information is needed 011 what changes occur in bone marrow cells in response to
space ﬂight. The invasive nature of the collection of human bone marrow specimens precludes
extensive study of human bone marrow. Therefore, rodent models are essential to revealing
clues about how space ﬂight impacts this critical system. To this end, we had access to normal
mouse bone marrow that was part of the Commercial Biomedical Test M0dule-2 (CBTM-Z)
payload experiment. Past space ﬂight rodent studies indicated that there are effects on early blast
cells (CFU-GM) in bone marrow (49, 50). Therefore, we assessed bone marrow cells for the
expression of differentiation and activation molecules to determine if space ﬂight affects speciﬁc
subpopulations of cells in the granulocytie lineage, e.g. macrophages and neutrophils.

Mice

"
"5","Shifts in Bone Marrow Cell Phenotypes Caused by Space Flight 5

Female C57BL/6 mice (n = 28) were nine weeks old at the beginning of the experiment.
The mice were obtained from Charles River Laboratories (Wilmington, MA) and were housed at
the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) Space Life Sciences Laboratory
Facility (SLSL) at Kennedy Space Center. The Institutional Animal Care and Use Committees
of NASA, Kansas State University, the University of Colorado and Loma Linda University
approved all procedures.

All mice were acclimated to the food bar diet (39, 63) prior to their selection for Flight 0r
Ground-control, (16, 48). Mice were housed in animal enclosure module (AEMs) housing for
ground control (Ground, n=12 mice) and ﬂight (Flight, n=12 mice) groups and were given the
same food bar diet. The space ﬂight group was ﬂown on the Space Shuttle Endeavour (STS-
118) which ﬂew for 13 days . Ground-control mice were exposed to environmental settings
(temperature, relative humidity, and atmospheric carbon dioxide levels) similar to the space
ﬂight animals using telemetry from the shuttle 011 a 48-hour time delay. Additional mice were
housed in standard Vivarium conditions (control; 4 mice). Mice had access to food and water ad
libitum. Lighting was 011 a 12hr: 12hr cycle.

Sample collection

Muscle strength testing and nuclear magnetic resonance imaging were performed prior to
euthanasia with 100% C02. Mice were euthanized within 3-4 h of landing. The humerii were
recovered and cleaned of all non-osseous tissue for the control, Flight, 0r Ground-control mice in
three consecutive sampling days. Due to the experimental design of the primary experiments of
the CBTM-2 payload, only humerii were available for this secondary experiment. This was an
acceptable alternative to obtaining bone marrow from hind-limb bones because in response to
skeletal unloading, the CFU-M colony formation was similar between bone marrow isolated

"
"6","Shifts in Bone Marrow Cell Phenotypes Caused by Space Flight 6
from humerii and bone marrow isolated from hind limbs (femora and tibiae) (6, 7). The marrow
cavity was ﬂushed with a sterile PBS solution. Red blood cells were lysed with ACK lysing
buffer reagent (0.15 M NH4C1, 10 mM KHCO3, and 0.1 mM NazEDTA). Cells were centrifuged
(300 X g, 5 min) and washed two times with PBS to remove serum components. Cells were
counted 011 a hemacytometer and suspended in 2% formalin in PBS at a concentration of 4 X 106
cells per m1. These cells were shipped at 4°C overnight to Kansas State University for further
analyses.

Bone marrow-derived cell labeling and FA CS analysis

Following arrival at Kansas State University, bone marrow cells were re-eounted and cell
concentrations were adjusted to 1 X 107 cells per m1. Phenotypic analysis of bone marrow-
derived cells was performed by ﬂuorescence-aetivated cell sorting 011 two successive days. Bone
marrow cells were blocked with PBS:g0at serum (50:50; 50 01) at 40C for 0.5 h. FITC- anti
Ly6C 0r anti IgM (0.5 pg), PE- anti CD11b 0r anti IgG2b (0.1 pg) , APC- anti CD31 or anti
IgG2a (0.5 pg), PE- anti Ly6G 0r anti IgG2b (0.1 pg), APC- anti F4/80 0r anti IgG2a (1.4 pg),
PE- anti CD44 or anti IgG2b (1 pg), and PE- anti e-Fos 0r anti IgG2b (3.8 pg) were added to the
cell suspensions and incubated at 40C for 1 h.. In some instances, multipleXing of antibodies
with compatible ﬂuroehromes was done (e.g. c-Fos and CD31 or Ly6C and CD31). The cells
were then washed twice in Hank’s Buffered Salt Solution and resuspended in 1% formalin. A
FACSCalibur ﬂow cytometer (Beeton Dickson. Rockville, MD) was used for the analyses. A
minimum of 20,000 events were collected for each sample. Sample gating was done so that
295% of the isotype control was in the lower-left quadrant (e.g. Figures 3-5) or was in the left
gate 011 histograms (e.g. Figure 2). Since the Flight and Ground-control bone marrow cell

"
"7","Shifts in Bone Marrow Cell Phenotypes Caused by Space Flight 7
surface antigens were analyzed on different days (the day after shipping), the day-to-day
differences in cell staining were normalized using control cells that were prepared at the SLSL at
Cape Canaveral and were stained at the same time as Flight 0r Ground samples (2 mice per
labeling day, Control ﬂight and Control ground). The Ground control data were normalized to
Flight data following the calculation: Normalized Ground data: (Control ﬂight/ContrOI ground) *
Ground control sample value.
Statistical analysis

Data were evaluated by factorial ANOVA with Tukey pairwise multiple comparison test
and Chi-Square (X2 ) test (Statmost, DetaXiom Software Inc, Los Angeles, CA). P values of
<0.05 were selected to indicate significance. The data are presented as the mean i SEM of 12
mice per treatment group.
RESULTS
Bone marrow cell numbers and subpopulations

Flight and Ground-control mice had body masses of 18.1i0.2 g before ﬂight. At landing,
all mice appeared well groomed with a normal coat appearance but they appeared disoriented.
Video documentation obtained in space on ﬂight days 5 and 6 indicated that the mice adapted
well to the space environment. They exhibited normal eating, grooming behavior and active
movement throughout the AEM including running and “ﬂying”. Veterinary examination at
landing found the mice to be in good health in spite of the weight loss. Ground-control mice
weighed 18.7i0.2 g (+33%) and Flight mice weighed 16.5i0.3 g (-8.8%). We isolated an
average of 6.9i0.5 X 106 bone marrow cells per mouse from 12 Flight mice and similar numbers

"
"8","Shifts in Bone Marrow Cell Phenotypes Caused by Space Flight 8
of bone marrow cells from 12 AEM-housed, Ground-eontrol mice (6.5i0.3 X 106). There were
no signiﬁcant differences in gross bone morphology between treatment groups or changes in the
bone marrow cell numbers between Flight- and Ground-eontrol mice.

Bone marrow cells were identiﬁed by size (forward scatter) and granularity (side scatter)
(Figure 1). The R1 region identiﬁed small, agranular cells. The R2 region identiﬁed cells that
were larger and more granular. Based on the expression of Ly6G (Gr-l) and CD1 1b, this region
contains many granulocytes (neutrophils) (Table 1). The largest, most granular cells were
identified in the R3 region. These cells had the highest level of staining for macrophages based
on the macrophage phenotypie expression of F4/ 80 and CD1 1b, which are expressed by
monocytes and macrophages in various tissues throughout the mouse (23) (Table 1).

We compared AEM-housed Ground controls and the mice that were ﬂown in space. R1
contained 38i1% 0f the bone marrow cells from Flight- 0r Ground-eontrol mice. R2 contained
38i1% and 36i1% 0f the bone marrow cells from Flight- and Ground-eontrol mice,
respectively. R3 contained 11i0% 0f the total bone marrow cell population for both treatment
groups. Therefore, space ﬂight did not radically disrupt the distribution of bone marrow cell
subpopulations.

T oral bone marrow phenotypic assessment

We analyzed the level of Ly6C expression on the total bone marrow population. Ly6C
expression is related to differentiation and identiﬁes cells at an intermediate stage within the
myeloid lineage, but is absent from cells of the erythroid lineage (30). Its expression is
completely lost by cells upon ﬁnal maturation into mature macrophages (17). Over all, 35i2%
of bone marrow cells from Flight animals were positive compared to 21i3% (P<0.01) positive

"
"9","Shifts in Bone Marrow Cell Phenotypes Caused by Space Flight 9
for bone marrow cells from the Ground-oontrol mice. The high levels of Ly6C are consistent
with the presence of high numbers of cells in the granulocytio lineage in bone marrow
developing for host innate immune responses. Bone marrow cells were 3i2% and 5 i 1%
(P<0.05) positive for CD31 (macrophages early in differentiation (17, 18, 62)) for Flight and
Ground-oontrol mice, respectively.

When we examined bone marrow cell expression of CD11b, a beta integrin that
participates in strong adhesion and trafﬁcking (27), we saw that the overall expression was low
in both mouse treatment groups compared to the expression in the R2 or R3 subpopulations.
Bone marrow cells were 11i1% and 14i1% (P<0.05) positive from Flight animals and Ground-
oontrol animals, respectively. These data are consistent with the low level expression of CD11b
in the whole bone marrow (33).

Ly6G is expressed predominantly on neutrophils. However, it can also be expressed on
differentiating pre-monooytes as well as other cells (3, 21, 31). There were no signiﬁcant
differences in Ly6G expression between the two treatment groups (Table 1). Overall, expression
of F4/ 80 ( a maerophage-speoiﬁo marker (11, 25)) expression was higher on bone marrow cells
from Flight animals compared to Ground-oontrols (7i1% vs. 3i0%, P<0.01).

CD44 is another oell-surfaoe protein involved in oell-oell interactions, migration, cell
adhesion, and lymphocyte activation (28). Some isoforms bind hyaluronio acid (32) which may
be important in organizing and regulating the function of bone marrow cells (36, 46). Most bone
marrow cells, especially granulocytes, express CD44 (55). Therefore, CD44 was also examined.
In the total bone marrow, there were two subpopulations of CD44+ cells (Figure 2). Therefore,
for our analyses, we assessed the “CD44high” and “CD4410W” populations separately. There were
no differences in treatment groups in the percentage of cells that were CD441”. For CD44high

"
"10","Shifts in Bone Marrow Cell Phenotypes Caused by Space Flight 10
cells, Flight and Ground-control animal bone marrow cells were 62i2 and 69i2% (P<0.05),
respectively.

R] subpopulation phenotypic assessment

The assessment of Ly6C and CD31 in the R1 population showed that overall, there was a
signiﬁcant increase in expression of Ly6C from 9i1% in Ground-control mice to 14i1%
(P<0.01) for Flight samples. The same trend was seen with Ly6C+CD31' cells (Figure 3) from
Ground control and Flight (3% and 5%, P<0.01, respectively). However, there were no
differences in Ly6C+CD31+ 0r Ly6C'CD31+ cell percentages in the R1 subpopulation.
Therefore, since Ly6C may discern differentiation (18), or may be important in the trafﬁcking of
CD8+ T lymphocytes (24) space ﬂight may have an effect on the small agranular cells in the R1
subpopulation.

There also was a decrease in CD31 from 14i2% 0n Ground-control mouse bone marrow
cells to 3i0% on Flight mouse bone marrow cells (P<0.01) in the R1 subpopulation. Because
CD31 is involved in the transmigration of cells into tissue (10), these data also support the
hypothesis that R1 cell trafficking may have been affected by space ﬂight.

There was approximately 2% expression of F4/ 80 and Ly6G in the R1 population. For C-
Fos, mouse bone marrow cells from Flight mice had slightly lower expression (5i1% vs. 2i1%;
P<0.01) than bone marrow cells from Ground-control mice. CD4410W expression was 59i1%,
and 57i1% for Ground-control and Flight mouse bone marrow, respectively. CD44high
expression (28i1% and 29i2% for Ground-control and Flight bone marrow, respectively) was
signiﬁcantly lower than CD4410W expression in the R1 subpopulation. These data are consistent

"
"11","Shifts in Bone Marrow Cell Phenotypes Caused by Space Flight 11
with observations that CD44 expression is higher 011 granulocytie cells (55). However, there was
no statistically significant space ﬂight effect 011 the expression of CD44 in the R1 subpopulation.
R2 subpopulation phenotypic assessment

There were no signiﬁcant differences in the expression of Ly6C, Ly6G, or F4/ 80 on bone
marrow cells in the R2 subpopulation between Flight and Ground-control animals. There was a
signiﬁcant increase in the expression of CD1 1b on bone marrow cells from Flight mice (50i3%)
compared to Ground-control mice (4i0%; P<0.01). This reversely correlated with the
expression of CD31 and c-Fos protein on bone marrow cells. Flight mice had 2i1 and 4i1%
CD31 and c-fos expressing cells compared to 10i2 (P<0.01) and 13i2% (P<0.01) expression by
bone marrow from Ground-control mice. Interestingly, there was expression of CD44high by the
R2 bone marrow cell subpopulation but 110 CD4410W expression. Flight mice had 92i1%
CD44high expressing cells compared to 95i1% (P<0.05) expression by bone marrow from
Ground-control mice.
R3 subpopulation phenotypic assessment

There was little difference in the R3 bone marrow cell expression of CD1 1b between
Flight and Ground-control mice. Flight mice had 40i3% CD1 1b expressing cells compared to
43i3% expression by bone marrow cells from Ground-control mice. There was a small but
significant difference in the cell expression of Ly6C and CD31 between Flight and Ground-
eontrol mice. Flight mice had 63i3% Ly6C expressing cells compared to 72i3% expression by
bone marrow from Ground-eontrol mice (P<0.01). Flight mouse bone marrow was 1i2%

"
"12","Shifts in Bone Marrow Cell Phenotypes Caused by Space Flight 12
positive for CD31 whereas bone marrow from Ground-control mice was 10i1% (P<0.05)
positive. These data were consistent when these two phenotypes were looked at in combination.
There was a decrease in the Ly6'CD31+ subpopulation (Figure 4). There also was a decrease in
the Ly6C+CD31+ subpopulation in cells from Flight mice compared to cells from Ground-control
mice (Figure 4). The evaluation of c-Fos in the R3 subpopulation showed that there was a
significant decrease in its expression (15 i3%) in Flight mice compared to Ground-control mice
(45 i3%, P<0.01). The same trend was seen with e-F0s+CD31+ cells from Flight and Ground-
eontrol mice (9i4% and 29i4%, P<0.01, respectively). Bone marrow cells that had the c-Fos'
CD31+phen0type were 48i4% positive. However, e-Fos'CD31+ cells were 0i6% (P<0.01) for
Ground-control mice (Figure 5). No differences in e-F0s+CD31' cell percentages were seen in the
R3 subpopulation (Figure 5). Ground-control mouse bone marrow cells were 8i1% positive for
F4/ 80 compared to 24i3% positive cells in the Flight samples (P<0.05). This inversely
correlated with the expression of Ly6G and CD44high which were 67i4% and 83i2% positive,
respectively, in Ground-eontrol mouse bone marrow cells compared to 26i1% and 64i4%
positive cells in Flight samples (P<0.05).
DISCUSSION

Bone marrow cells from the CBTM-2 payload were analyzed in this study as a complete
bone marrow population and as cell subpopulations distinguished by size and granularity. Ly6C
was the only surface molecule signiﬁcantly elevated on whole bone marrow cells from Flight
mice compared to Ground-control mice. This contrasts the observations of Pecaut et al. (41)
who did not see changes in Ly6A/E in their analysis of mouse marrow following a 12 day ﬂight
011 STS-108. This difference was probably because Ly6A/E is expressed on different cell

"
"13","Shifts in Bone Marrow Cell Phenotypes Caused by Space Flight 13
populations than Ly6C, which was targeted in this study because of its higher speciﬁcity for cells
in the granulocytic lineage than the other Ly6 family members (9, 42). This hypothesis is
supported by the observations from STS-108 (41) and STS-118 (this report) in which there were
no differences in total numbers of bone marrow cells isolated from Flight and Ground-control
mice, yet there were differences between bone marrow subpopulations (this report). It is
possible that we might have observed a different outcome had we examined bone marrow from
the femur instead of the humerii. However, experience with skeletally unloaded mice using
antiorthostatie suspension suggests that the changes in bone (47) and bone marrow (6, 7) are
systemic in response to unloading. Therefore, we don’t think this is a serious concern.

Although Ly6C expression was elevated on whole bone marrow isolated from Flight
mice compared to Ground controls; the whole bone marrow composite phenotype expression
demonstrated no signiﬁcant difference between Flight and Ground control mouse bone marrow
(P>0.2 by X2). This is not surprising because bone marrow contains a heterogeneous population
of cells that share phenotypes. Therefore, we analyzed subpopulations of cells that were
distinguished on their size and granularity. Three subpopulations of cells were identiﬁed and
were assessed for the expression of Ly6C, CD11b, CD31, Ly6G, F4/80, CD44 and c-Fos.

Cell surface antigen expression differences were present within space ﬂight
subpopulations. For example, Ly6C expression was elevated by space ﬂight in the small
agranular R1 subpopulation but was lower in the R3 subpopulation. The R1 population
contained the fewest numbers of macrophages and neutrophils based on the expression of F4/80,
CD11b and Ly6G. Given that Ly6C is expressed on cells at less mature stages within the
myeloid lineage (30), these data suggest that the impact of space ﬂight was 011 less mature cells
compared to more mature cells in the granulocytic lineage. This hypothesis is supported by the

"
"14","Shifts in Bone Marrow Cell Phenotypes Caused by Space Flight 14
expression of CD31 as well. CD31 expression distinguishes macrophages early in differentiation
(17, 18, 62). c-Fos is also expressed during early myeloid cell development (38, 60). Therefore,
c-Fos expression is normally expected concurrently with CD31 expression at initial macrophage
differentiation stages under normal conditions. As differentiation proceeds, c-Fos expression
ceases as CD31 levels begin to decline. The depression in the e-F0s+CD31+ population and the
increase in the e-Fos'CD31+ in R3 bone marrow cells from Flight mice suggests that the STSl 18
space ﬂight increased macrophage development resulting in the presence of more differentiated
cells than in the Ground-control mice.

CD11b was signiﬁcantly elevated on bone marrow cells in the R2 population after space
ﬂight. CD11b is involved in trafﬁcking and strong adhesion of macrophages and granulocytes in
trafficking. Therefore, the elevation of this marker on the R2 subpopulation but not R1 or R3
subpopulation may reﬂect the activation of the enriched neutrophil population in the R2 group in
response to landing. Unfortunately, the experimental design of this study precluded the
collection of blood for differential analysis. Therefore, we cannot make a direct comparison
between what was occurring in the bone marrow and the peripheral blood cell populations.
However, neutrophilia has been seen as a consequence of landing stress in past rodent ﬂights (2,
13, 14, 26). Consequently, the specific impact on the R2 subpopulation would be consistent with
these observations.

The greater decrease in expression of CD44high and Ly6G in the R3 bone marrow
subpopulation from Flight mice but not R1 or R2 subpopulations was also notable. In fact, there
was a reverse correlation between the expression level of CD44high and Ly6G, which are strongly
expressed on PMNs and the increased expression of F4/ 80 in R3. Because F4/ 80 identifies
mature macrophages, these data suggest that space ﬂight caused increases in the percentage of

"
"15","Shifts in Bone Marrow Cell Phenotypes Caused by Space Flight 15
mature macrophages in the bone marrow or decreased the percentages of PMNs. The stress of
landing could induce the mobilization of bone marrow PMNs into circulation and cause such an
impact (2, 13, 14, 26). Although this is an attractive hypothesis that would be consistent with
data from other ﬂights, there were no differences in bone marrow cell numbers between Flight
mice and Ground-oontrol mice to account for margination. Therefore, other factors may also be
affecting the distribution of macrophages in R3 subpopulation. The loss of cell numbers and a
decrease in the percentage of monocytes/ macrophages in the spleen of these ﬂight mice (Baqai
et al submitted for publication) would be consistent with increased trafﬁcking of those cells to
the bone marrow. Alternatively, the decrease in Ly6C, o-Fos and/or Ly6G and increases in

F4/ 80 might suggest that the cells in the R3 subpopulation were more differentiated in the Flight
mice compared to the Ground controls. This hypothesis is consistent with the diminished
expression of the IGF-lR on monocytes during space ﬂight (34) since the expression of IGF-lR
is reduced as macrophages differentiate (5).

The shift in cellular phenotypes is a complex process. For this reason, we compared the
composite phenotypes of each of the three subpopulations of Flight bone marrow cells and
Ground-oontrol bone marrow cells using both parametric (Factorial ANOVA) and nonparametric
statistics (X2)- R1, R2 and R3 comparisons between Flight and Ground control AEM-housed
mice suggests that there are signiﬁcant differences (P<0.01) between cells in the two treatment
groups for all three subpopulations with either type of analysis. The mice were analyzed post-
landing. Therefore, it is not possible to separate the landing effects from the ﬂight effects.
Based on behaVioral observations made at days 5-6 during ﬂight (normal grooming, eating,
drinking and movement) and the veterinary examination post ﬂight the animals were healthy.
The weight loss most likely occurred in the ﬁrst 3 days of habituation to the change in gravity

"
"16","Shifts in Bone Marrow Cell Phenotypes Caused by Space Flight 16
during the space ﬂight (37, 51, 59). Nevertheless, the loss in body weight and the significant
thymio atrophy (Baqai et al. submitted for publication) that was seen in these mice suggests that
the mice were subj eoted to chronic stress beyond that what was endured during landing.
Therefore, it is not unreasonable to suggest that there are signiﬁcant changes in bone marrow
phenotype in response to the stress of the space ﬂight experience. Bone marrow cells are plastic
in their response to host factors (52). Furthermore, changes in bone marrow cell distribution not
only are seen in rats and mice in response to space ﬂight (41, 50), bone marrow cell distribution
is responsive to other stressors such as reactive oxygen species (43), ionizing radiation (15),
ovariectomy (22) and gluoooortiooid administration (54). It is also not clear if these differences
translate into changes in immune competence (12), but the data are consistent with observations
that the number of CFU-M and CFU-GM are decreased during space ﬂight (26, 49, 50). The
shift toward more differentiated cells in the R2 and R3 subpopulations would reduce the number
of early CFU-GM available to respond to colony stimulating factor to differentiate into the
appropriate cell lineage. If humans aspire to interplanetary space travel, appropriate concern
and planning are needed to manage the possible consequences of a long-term space ﬂight on
hematopoiesis.
