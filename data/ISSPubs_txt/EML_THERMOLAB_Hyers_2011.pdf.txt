Abstract. Fluid ﬂow can have a profound effect on phase selection and nucleation in undercooled
liquid metals.

In phase selection experiments, the sample does not solidify directly to the thermodynamically
stable phase, but instead ﬁrst forms a metastable phase, then transforms to the stable phase after some
delay. Previous experiments and modeling on phase selection in near-eutectic Fe-Cr-Ni stainless
steels have shown that the lifetime of the metastable phase is limited by the incubation time for
formation of a critical nucleus of the stable phase, and that for some conditions, ﬂuid ﬂow can change
that incubation time by an order of magnitude or more. New microgravity experiments in this area
will be performed on new materials, including peritectic alloys, in the Materials Science Laboratory
Electromagnetic LeVitator (MSL-EML) as a part of projects PARSEC and THERMOLAB. The
models that predict the effect of ﬂuid ﬂow on phase selection will be extended to these new
experiments.

In another class of experiments, nucleation in quasicrystal- and glass-forming alloys, testing a new
theory on nucleation kinetics requires control of the shear rate in ﬂuid ﬂow to prevent interference of
the solute ﬁelds around the sub-critical nuclei. These theories will be tested in microgravity using the
MSL-EML under the proj ects ICOPROSOL and THERMOLAB.

1. Introduction
Fluid ﬂow has been shown to have an effect on a variety of solidiﬁcation and nucleation processes.
Effects which have been observed include distortion of solutal and thermal diffusion ﬁelds, gross ﬂuid
ﬂow leading to macrosegregation, and even mechanical effects such as the bending or breaking of
dendrites.

TWO groups of experiments are discussed in this paper. Each group is being developed by
international teams assembled under the European Space Agency’s announcements of opportunity.
The ﬁrst group of experiments deals With phase selection in metals. Eutectic alloys including Fe-Cr-
Ni alloys are being studied under the European Thermolab project, With the American partners funded
under NASA’s project LODESTARS. Related experiments on peritectic alloys including Fe-Co and
Ti-Al-Ta are under ESA’s PARSEC and NASA’s ELFSTONE. These projects are described in more
detail in [1].

The second group of experiments discussed here is looking at nucleation in quasicrystal- and glass-
forming alloys. This group also includes samples under ESA’s Thermolab projects, and ESA’s
ICOPROSOL / NASA’s QUASI projects. These experiments are described in more detail in [2].

2. Phase Selection in Eutectic and Peritectic Alloys
In phase selection experiments, the sample does not solidify directly to the thermodynamically stable
phase, but instead ﬁrst forms a metastable phase, then transforms to the stable phase after some delay.
Previous experiments and modeling on phase selection in near-eutectic Fe-Cr-Ni stainless steels have
shown that the lifetime of the metastable phase is limited by the incubation time for formation of a
critical nucleus of the stable phase, and that for some conditions, that incubation time may change by
an order of magnitude or more (Fig. 1). All of the experiments shown in Fig. 1 had spontaneous
nucleation.

samples. One hypothesis that remained was examined by Hanlon, et al., [5]: that ﬂow in the liquid
part of the sample was causing deﬂection of the dendrite arrays sufﬁcient to cause collision of the
secondary arms, leading to crevice nucleation (Fig. 2). They used computational ﬂuid dynamics to
determine the drag force on the tips of the primary arms (Fig. 3), and then evaluated analytical models
to make quantitative predictions for different mechanisms of deﬂection including creep and elastic and
plastic bending. They determined that elastic deformation of the growing dendrites would be
sufﬁcient to cause collision when the dendrites reached a critical length, and determined the time to
reach that length from measurements of the growth velocity [6]. The resulting time to collision
predicted by the model matched the experimental delay time within the scatter of the experimental

data [5].

ﬂow on the growing metastable dendrites [5].

This model requires a signiﬁcant amount of information about the microstructure of the metastable
phase, including diameters of the primary arms of the dendrites and spacing of the secondary arms.
This information is collected from micrographs of samples quenched between the formation of the
stable and metastable phases, egg. [7]. The micrographs of the quenched structure show that at a time
within fractions of a millisecond before the nucleation of the stable phase, the dendrites have the
approximately parallel arrangement assumed in the model.

The input data necessary for the models were available for two other compositions, one with a very
low thermodynamic driving force for transformation (the difference in free energy between the
metastable and stable phases), and one with an intermediate driving force. The sample with an
intermediate driving force showed fair agreement with the model, indicating that the same mechanism
is plausible for that alloy as well. For the smallest driving force, there was no agreement, indicating
that this mechanism is not active. For a transformation with a small driving force, it is plausible that
the transformation might not happen immediately on establishment of the crevice.

For application of Hanlon’s model to the new eutectic and peritectic systems to be tested under
THERMOLAB/LODESTARS and PARSEC/ELFSTONE, respectively, a number of data are required.
These include:

- Properties of the liquid including density, Viscosity, electrical conductivity. These
properties Will be measured on the ﬂight samples as a part of the experiments in MSL-
EML.

- Properties of the solid at its melting point, including elastic modulus and yield strength.
The delay time predicted by the model is only weakly inﬂuenced by these properties, so
extrapolations from lower temperatures Will be used.

- Properties of the metastable dendrite array, including primary and secondary arm
spacing and the diameter of the primary arms. These are the most difﬁcult to obtain of
all the needed data. Hanlon used micrographs by Kosecki [7] of samples quenched in
the metastable state. Replicating this measurement is an important part of the ground
support program for these experiments.

Once these data are obtained, the chain of models Will allow determination of the range of convection
Where ﬂuid-ﬂow effects are expected to be important, and from there, the parameters needed to test for
the presence of this mechanism in phase selection in the new alloys.

3. Nucleation in Undercooled Metals
The coupled-ﬂuX theory of nucleation has been well established for oxide glasses [8]. Testing this
theory in metals is experimentally very difﬁcult, in part because convection tends to distort the
diffusion proﬁles around the subcritical nuclei since the Viscosity is many orders of magnitude smaller
than in the silicates. Microgravity experiments provide the possibility of removing the convective
distortion, but models are needed to quantify convective ﬂow and relate it to controllable experimental
parameters.

The simple model for the relevant phenomena is depicted in Fig. 4. Two nuclei, each surrounded
by its diffusion ﬁeld, are carried along With the moving ﬂuid. However, since the velocity of the ﬂuid
cannot be uniform throughout an EML droplet, nuclei on nearby streamlines move at different
velocities. If the centers of the nuclei are close enough in the direction normal to the ﬂow, then the
diffusion ﬁelds Will eventually interact. If the centers are farther apart than one diffusion ﬁeld
diameter, then the nuclei Will pass Without interacting.

Figure 4. Model for the effect of ﬂuid ﬂow on the diffusion ﬁelds around subcritical nuclei [9].

The case illustrated in Fig. 4 provides the shortest possible time before the nuclei interact. Knowing
the dimensions of the diffusion ﬁeld and the number density of nuclei, it is possible to calculate a
constraint on the allowable shear rate to prevent collisions during the time of the experiment. For a
cluster separation d of 1 — 0.1 um, a diffusion ﬁelds of radius rD of about 10 nm, and a cooling rate of
about 10 oC s_l, the result is that the velocity is not explicitly constrained, but the shear rate must be
less than 0.05/s throughout the drop [9].

Other effects must also be considered. First, the diffusivity of momentum (kinematic Viscosity) is
perhaps four orders of magnitude greater than the diffusivity of solute in these alloys, so momentum
transfer Will happen much faster and at much longer range than the diffusion ﬁelds around the nuclei.

However, the nuclei are very small, only nanometers in diameter, so the Stokes number is very close
to zero (of the order 10'13 D. That means that the nuclei follow the path of the surrounding ﬂuid very
precisely, and do not distort the streamlines. Accordingly, each differential volume of ﬂuid behaves
the same Whether the next differential volume is liquid or crystalline, and the nuclei are transported as
in the model in Fig. 4.

Second, the shear in the ﬂuid affects each nucleus directly. Because of ﬂuid drag, the top of each
nucleus in Figure 4 must move faster than the center, and the bottom must move slower, so each
nucleus must rotate. The rotation rate in radians per second must approximately equal to the shear rate
in inverse seconds. Rotating spheres in a ﬂow experience lift due to the Magnus effect, Which causes
baseballs and tennis balls to curve. The lift due to the Magnus effect is proportional to the cross
product of the vorticity and the relative velocity between the sphere and the ﬂuid. In this case, as
already established, the relative velocity is zero, so the Magnus forces are also zero.

Finally, the rotation itself Will cause some distortion of the ﬂuid ﬂow as the nucleus rotates like a
centrifugal pump. This effect Will cause an additional radial outﬂow in the plane of Figure 4, and a
compensating inﬂow toward the nuclei from planes above and below the ﬁgure. However, the
rotation rate is very low, of the order 0.05 rad/sec, and the impeller radius is also very small, of the
order nanometers. The resulting ﬂow is too small to have a signiﬁcant effect on the diffusion ﬁelds,
again conﬁrming the simple picture in Figure 4.

Finally, now that the constraints on the ﬂow ﬁeld have been established, magnetohydrodynamic
models are used to determine the corresponding constraints on the operational parameters such as coil
currents in the MSL-EML. These models use properties measured in the ground support program, and
Will be updated With properties determined on the ﬂight samples as a part of the experimental
program.

4. Conclusions

Fluid ﬂow is important in both classes of experiments described above, but through different

mechanisms. In one case, the shear rate in the ﬂuid must be kept everywhere below a particular value

to test a theory about nucleation of crystals in a liquid, While in the other the ﬂuid’s velocity must be

varied Within a range to test a theory about nucleation of the stable phase in a mixture of liquid and

metastable solid. Computational models of the magnetohydrodynamic ﬂows in electromagnetically

leVitated droplets, combined With accurate thermophysical properties, allow the use of ﬂow as an

experimental parameter.
