Astronauts live and work in relatively crowded, conﬁned environments on the Space Shuttle and the
International Space Station. They experience a unique set of stressors that contribute to a diminishment of
many immune responses. This study investigated the ability of the shuttle crew members’ monocytes to respond 9
t0 gram-negative endotoxin that they could encounter during infections. Blood specimens were collected from g
20 crew members and 15 control subjects 10 days before launch, 3 t0 4 h after landing, and 15 days after 2
landing and from crew members during their annual medical examination at 6 to 12 months after landing. 8
When challenged with gram-negative endotoxin, the crew member’s monocytes collected at all three time points %
produced lower levels of interleukin-6 (IL-6) and IL-lB and higher levels of IL-lra and IL-8 compared to those Q_
of control subjects. Cytokines were assessed by measuring the number of cells positive for intracellular :9
cytokines. These values returned to normal 6 to 12 months after landing, except for IL-lra, which was still g
higher (ﬁve- to sixfold) than in controls. This phenomenon was accompanied by an increased expression of
Toll-like receptor 4 and decreased expression of CD14 on the crew members’ monocytes at all time points. a
There were also increased levels of the lipopolysaccharide binding protein in the plasma of the crew members '8
