Abstract
The Polymer F ilm Tensile Experiment (PFTE) was ﬂown as part of Materials International Space
Station Experiment 6 (MISSE 6). The purpose of the experiment was to expose a variety of polymer ﬁlms
to the low Earth orbital environment under both relaxed and tension conditions. The polymers selected are
those commonly used for spacecraft thermal control and those under consideration for use in spacecraft
applications such as sunshields, solar sails, and inﬂatable and deployable structures. The dog-bone shaped
samples of polymers that were ﬂown were exposed on both the side of the MISSE 6 Passive Experiment
Container (PEC) that was facing into the ram direction (receiving atomic oxygen, ultraviolet (UV)
radiation, ionizing radiation, and thermal cycling) and the wake facing side (which was supposed to have
experienced predominantly the same environmental effects except for atomic oxygen which was present
due to reorientation of the International Space Station). A few of the tensile samples were coated with
vapor deposited aluminum 0n the back and wired to determine the point in the ﬂight when the tensile
sample broke as recorded by a change in voltage that was stored on battery powered data loggers for post
ﬂight retrieval and analysis. The data returned on the data loggers was not usable. However, post retrieval
observation and analysis of the samples was performed. This paper describes the preliminary analysis and
observations of the polymers exposed on the MISSE 6 PFTE.
Introduction
Thin ﬁlm polymers are used in many spacecraft applications for thermal control (multi-layer
insulation and sunshields), as lightweight structural members (solar array blankets, inﬂatable/deployable
structures) and have been proposed for propulsion (solar sails). Polymers in these applications are
exposed to the space environment and are vulnerable to degradation by solar ultraviolet radiation, solar
ﬂare X-rays, solar wind electrons and protons trapped in Earth’s magnetic ﬁeld, temperature and orbital
thermal cycling and low Earth orbit atomic oxygen (Ref. 1). In applications where the polymer ﬁlm is
under tension while exposed to these environmental factors, it is important to understand the effect of
stress in combination with the environment on the durability of thin polymer ﬁlms. Polymer ﬁlm tensile
specimens were previously ﬂown in the Polymer F ilm Thermal Control Experiment and the Gossamer
Materials Experiment as part of the experiments included on Materials International Space Station
Experiment (MISSE) 1 as well as on MISSE 3, MISSE 4, and MISSE 5 in order to expose thin polymer

ﬁlm tensile specimens to the space environment under different exposure conditions for evaluation of the
effect of the environment on the tensile strength and percent elongation (Refs. 2 and 3). The MISSE 6
exposure is different from prior such experiments in that a number of the samples were designed to be
exposed while under tension to better simulate their use in space and determine if the stress level affects
the durability. It was also planned to be an active experiment with monitoring and capture of the electrical
continuity of several of the tensile dogbones utilizing dataloggers. A total of 17 samples were ﬂown on
the ram facing side of MISSE 6 and 24 samples were ﬂown on the wake facing side. The results of the
post ﬂight initial observation and analysis are described in this paper.
MISSE 6 Environment Description
MISSE 6 was composed of two Passive Experiment Containers (PECS), 6A and 6B. Both PECS had
one side of the suitcase style containers facing ram and the other side facing wake. They were both
installed by astronauts on the European Columbus module of the International Space Station (ISS) on
March 22, 2008 during the ﬂight of STS-123. They were retrieved on September 1, 2009, by the crew of
STS-128 after slightly over 17 months in low Earth orbit (LEO). Figure 1 shows a photo and close-up
image of the ram side of the MISSE 6 PECS on ISS. Environment exposure conditions that have been
determined to date are the atomic oxygen exposure level on each side and the UV radiation level. M.
Finckenor (NASA MSFC) (Ref. 4) and K. de Groh (NASA GRC) (Ref. 5) provided estimates of the
atomic oxygen arrival based on erosion of samples of Kapton HN that were ﬂown as ﬂuence monitors on
individual experiments, there were also two Kapton HN/VDA tensile dogbones that were ﬂown as part of
this experiment on the wake side of MISSE 6A from which scanning electron microscope images of
protected locations on the surface were used to determine the erosion depth and ultimately the atomic
oxygen ﬂuence. All of the data seemed in good agreement with an estimate of the atomic oxygen arrival
ﬂuence for the ram side of 6A and 6B of approximately 2><1021 atoms/cmz, and for the wake side
approximately 1.2 to 1.4><1020 atoms/cmz. This indicates that the wake side of MISSE 6, which was to

received an atomic oxygen dose about 6.5 percent that of the ram oriented side. Estimates of the UV
radiation exposure in equivalent sun hours (ESH) were provided by Gary Pippin (Boeing Corp.) (Ref.6)
to be 2600 ESH for the ram sides of 6A and 6B and 1950 ESH for the wake sides of 6A and 6B.
Temperature, thermal cycling, and ionizing radiation estimates were not available at this time.
PFTE Experiment Description and Procedure
Experiment Design for Application of Tensile Stress
The experiment was designed to allow some of the polymer dog-bone type samples to be exposed
under a tensile load typical of expected conditions for the J ames Webb Space Telescope sunshield. The
tensile load of approximately 0.5 lb (~2.22 N) was applied by mounting the sample in a holder similar to
that shown on the left side of the photo in Figure 2 and then compressing a spring with a spring constant
of 2.2 lb/in. (~3 85 N/m) by approximately 0.227 in. (~0.0058 m) to put the sample under a tensile load.
The drawing in Figure 2 shows a double sample holder where the sample on the left did not have an
applied tensile stress and the one on the right did. Originally, the experiment was designed to have eight
of the ram and 11 0f the wake samples exposed under tension, but difﬁculty in applying tension to some
of the samples resulted in only three of the ram facing and seven wake facing samples exposed to the
environment under stress. For the exposed samples, the resulting stress was dependent on the polymer
ﬁlm thickness per equation 1 with an average gage width of approximately 0.126 in. (0.0032 m).
Stress = w = (Force)/((Gage width)* Thickness) (1)
Area
For the majority of the samples, the stress during exposure was either ~2000 psi (~1.38><107 N/m2) for
2 mil (5.08><10'5 m) polymer ﬁlms or ~4000 psi (~2.76><107 N/m2) for 1 mil (2.54><10'5 m) polymer ﬁlms.

center and right show an expanded and assembled side view with the electrical contacts to the sample back.
Experiment Design for Active Monitoring of the Break Point
Active monitoring of some of the tensile samples to determine the time on orbit to sample break was
attempted using electrical continuity. Samples that were insulating on the side not exposed to space were
coated with vapor deposited aluminum through a mask as shown on the far left of Figure 3. Black Delrin
clamping plates were used to provide electrical insulation from the aluminum sample support underneath
while a second set of screws inside the mount screws made electrical contact with the aluminum coating
on either end of the back side of the sample. A 5 V power supply was used to supply current to the dog-
bones and the voltage drop across the samples was monitored and stored in a series of dataloggers that
were on MISSE 6. The data recorded was designed to indicate failure by a change in the voltage across
the sample. Due to difﬁculty in wiring the samples without shorting, only three stressed samples on the
ram side and one on the wake side were wired for ﬂight. All three stressed samples on the ram side broke
during ﬂight but the change was not evident in the data from the dataloggers. All channels including ones
that were unused registered approximately 1 V for the entire ﬂight so the data were not usable to
determine the time on orbit at which the samples on the ram side broke.
Description of Samples
The polymers that were exposed on MISSE 6B, ram facing tray G3 are listed in Table I and those
ﬂown on MISSE 6A, wake facing tray G2 are listed in Table II. Coated samples are indicated by a “/”
separating each layer. The layers are listed in order from closest to farthest from the space-facing surface.
Samples for ﬂight and control were punched from sheets supplied by the sources listed in the table using a
die manufactured according to specimen “Type V” under the American Society for Testing and Materials
(ASTM) Standard D-638 (Ref. 7). The dog-bone shaped die had a gage length of 7.62 mm and an average
gage width of 3.21 i 0.02 mm (0.126 in.). Samples that were insulating on the non-space facing side that
were to be wired for active monitoring were coated with a rectangular mask pattern of vapor deposited
aluminum to provide electrical contact. These samples are noted in the table with an asterisk. Samples
that were ﬂown under stress are indicated by light gray shading in the table.

"10","Post Flight Analysis
Overall and close up photos were taken of the samples post ﬂight using a Sony Cybershot DSC T-9
camera. Initial observations were recorded and a few selected samples were gold coated and mounted for
scanning electron microscopy with a J OEL J SM-63 90 LV scanning electron microscope with energy
dispersive analysis by X-rays (EDAX).
Results and Discussion
Overall Observations
Close-up on orbit photos of the ram tray G3 and wake tray G2 just prior to retrieval are shown in
Figure 4(a) and (b), respectively. On the ram facing tray all of the stressed samples showed evidence of
breaking and curling up of the tensile dog-bones, while none of the stressed samples on the wake side
were broken. Also, there was a noticeable change to the black Kapton XC sample AO-S-l which is shown
on the far right of Figure 4(a). The sample appeared to be longer than when initially installed and had a
silvered appearance on the end that was stretched. This sample was in a sample holder initially designed
for putting the sample under a tensile load so the holder on the top side of the sample had a slotted mount
hole. It appears that the sample was inadvertently bumped and the one end of the holder moved putting
the sample under a tensile stress even though it was not initially intended to be stressed. There was a cable
that was passed up between the G3 tray and the neighboring tray which was very close to this sample
which may have provided the opportunity for inadvertent bumping of the one end of the sample holder
during experiment installation.
SiOX/Kapton HN
There were two unstressed samples of this material ﬂown on the ram side tray (G3). Both samples
appeared to have some coating defects on the surface (scratches, pinholes) that allowed some erosion of
the Kapton HN around the defect site by atomic oxygen typical of that observed on previous ﬂights
(Ref. 1). Other than this, the samples appeared typical of the pre-ﬂight samples and showed no evidence
of failure. Figure 5 contains a photo of one of the unstressed samples (AO-U-Z) post ﬂight.

Figure 6.—(a) SiOX/Kapton HN stressed sample AO-S—6 from ram side tray G3 showing break. (b) SiOX/Kapton HN
stressed sample UV-S-8 from wake side tray 62 showing coating cracking.

The stressed samples (with ~2000 psi (~ l.38><107 N/m2)) applied stress which is about 6 percent of
the ultimate tensile strength for Kapton HN (33,500 psi (2.3 l ><108 N/m2)) both on the ram and wake sides
showed evidence of coating cracking. The ram side received enough atomic oxygen arrival that the
sample weakened and broke at what appears to be a line of defects that extended across the width of the
dog-bone sample as shown in Figure 6(a). The amount of atomic oxygen arrival would have been
enough to erode completely an unprotected 2 mil (5.08><10'5 m) sample of Kapton HN. Figure 6(b)
shows the wake facing sample which was also under stress but received much less atomic oxygen
exposure (~7 percent that of the ram side). Even though the sample is not broken, the coating itself
appears damaged. For both samples the strain (stress divided by the modulus of elasticity (379000 psi
(2.61 ><109 N/mz) for Kapton HN)) was about 0.005 or about 0.7 percent of the maximum strain for
Kapton HN. Even though the level of stress and strain the samples were subj ected to is low for Kapton
HN, the stressed sample on the ram side still failed. It is believed that the failure is primarily due to
atomic oxygen erosion at coating defect sites for this material.

Kapton HN/VDA

There were only two samples of Kapton HN/VDA ﬂown on the wake side of MISSE 6. Both were
ﬂown unstressed and had a matte appearance post ﬂight but no evidence of sample failure. The matte
appearance was due to atomic oxygen texturing of the Kapton HN as evident in the scanning electron
microscope (SEM) photos shown in Figure 7(a) and (b). Figure 7(a) shows a textured area including a
micrometeoroid or debris impact and Figure 7(b) shows a butte where there was a particle on the surface
that protected the Kapton HN from erosion underneath it. This area and others like it were used to
determine an estimate for the atomic oxygen ﬂuence. The erosion depth (cm) multiplied by the erosion
yield (cm3/atom) for Kapton HN gives the atomic oxygen dose or ﬂuence in atoms/cmz. One interesting
thing to note about the texture is that for the most part it is very vertical which indicates that the wake side
was close to being directly ram oriented for most of the time it was exposed to atomic oxygen.

Si/Kapton E/VDA/Inconel/VDA
This material was identiﬁed for the J ames Webb Space Telescope sunshield, which will not be ﬂown
in low Earth orbit and will, therefore, not be exposed to signiﬁcant amounts of atomic oxygen. Thus, the
results most pertinent to its JWST application are those from samples ﬂown on the wake surface. There
were four unstressed samples of this material ﬂown on the ram facing side of MISSE 6 and three
unstressed samples on the wake facing side. All appeared typical of pre-ﬂight samples and had no Visual
evidence of failure or change as shown in Figure 8(a). The three stressed samples were only ﬂown on the
wake facing side. They were stressed to a level of ~2000 psi (~l.38><107 N/mz) which represents about
4 percent of the ultimate tensile strength for Kapton E (50000 psi (3.45><108 N/m2)). The strain level
(stress /modulus (800000 psi (5.52><109 N/m2)) was 00025 which was about 0.5 percent of the maximum
strain for Kapton E. The stress and strain again were low but there was some slight evidence of cracking
of the Si coating for these samples as shown in Figure 8(b) but no failure of the polymer.
VDA/CPl
The two unstressed samples of this material on the ram side and the three unstressed samples on the

wake side all appeared typical of the pre-ﬂight samples as did the one sample ﬂown purposely in reverse
(CPl/VDA) on the wake side which was also ﬂown unstressed. Figure 9(a) shows one of the unstressed
VDA/CPl samples (AO-U-7). The two stressed samples on the ram side broke during the MISSE 6
exposure, while the stressed sample on the wake side did not. Figure 9(b) shows one of the broken
samples of VDA/CPl from the ram side (AO-S-5). The wake side stressed sample appeared typical of
pre-ﬂight samples like that shown in Figure 9(a). The stress on these samples during the ﬂight was
~4000 psi (~2.76><107 N/mz), which was about 28 percent of the ultimate tensile strength (14,500 psi
(~l ><108 N/m2)). The strain (stress/modulus (315000 psi (2.l7><109 N/m2)) was 0.013.

FEP/VDA

Both 2 and 5 mil samples of FEP/VDA were ﬂown on the ram and wake sides. All were ﬂown
unstressed, but one of each of the 2 and 5 mil samples were ﬂown pulled taut on the ram side. All looked
very similar in appearance with scratches and scuff marks on the surface but there was no evidence of
failure or a difference in the loosely held versus taut samples that could be Visually observed. Figure 10
shows a typical FEP/VDA sample ﬂown on the ram side of MISSE 6 (AO-U-8).

Kapton XC

Two unstressed samples of black Kapton (XC) were exposed on the ram side of MISSE 6. Both
samples appeared to show evidence of texturing of the surface with a darker appearance near each end of
the dog-bone sample. One of these samples was inadvertently put under stress when one end of the
sample holder was moved and changed the overall sample length by ~0.068 in. (~0.0017 m). This put a
strain on the sample (for an undetermined length of time) which could be calculated by dividing the
change in length (0.068 in. (0.0017 m)) by the original length (~0.934 in. (0.0237 m)) to result in a strain
of ~0.07. This represents approximately 26 percent of the maximum strain for Kapton XC. The resulting
stress on the sample could be determined by multiplying the strain by the elastic modulus (480000 psi
(3.31><109 N/m2)) which gives a stress of 33,600 psi (2.32><108 N/mz) which is greater than the yield
strength of Kapton XC. This is also evident from Figure 11 by the distortion and stretching of the top end
of the sample as shown in the photograph.

The appearance of the sample raises several questions. The ﬁrst is why the stretched end appears
silver and the second is why the black Kapton appears to be darker in the region of higher stress? In order
to try to answer these questions, SEM and EDAX analysis was performed on the sample at selected
locations shown in Figure 12 and Figure 13 after applying a light gold coating to the sample to reduce
charging during examination at 10 kV.

Figure 12.—SEM images of selected positions on sample AO-S—1 exposed on the ram side of MISSE 6
SEM images shown in Figure 12 show a signiﬁcant change in surface morphology from the center to
the edge. The center portion has a smooth lumpy appearance typical of black Kapton Which progresses to
an area Which looks as if it had a thin ﬁlm gossamer coating on it With many cracks perpendicular to the
pull direction. There are ﬁne cone-like peaks in areas where there is cracking Which progresses to almost
all peaks With thin wisps of ﬁlm on the surface nearer to the silver area. At the edge where the sample
separated, there are only a few short peaks remaining. EDAX scans shown in Figure 13 indicate mostly
carbon and oxygen signals in the central region progressing to a high concentration of aluminum near the
stretched end. This sample was originally intended to be put under stress and Wired so there was a vapor
deposited aluminum coating on the back side. It appears that as the stress on the sample is increased, the
erosion rate of the black Kapton increases Which results in ﬁrst development of surface texture cones and
a thin ﬁlm of ash from oxidation of the black Kapton. This progresses to loss of ash and erosion of the

mostly carbon cones to the point at which the vapor deposited aluminum is predominantly what is left
looking like a blanket of snow at the base of the remaining carbon peaks. If erosion of the Kapton XC is
dependent on the level of stress, then there should also be a difference in the samples that are under stress
compared to those that are not under stress on the wake side.

The two unstressed samples on the wake side appeared to show slight evidence of texturing of the
surface with the samples appearing slightly darker towards each end, while the 2 stressed samples were
very dark matte black in appearance. Figure 14 shows a side-by-side comparison of one pair of the
stressed and unstressed Kapton XC samples exposed on the wake side of MISSE 6.

The stress level during exposure was ~4000 psi (r~2.76><107 N/mz). The strain (stress/modulus
(480000 psi (3.3 ><109 N/m2))) for the black Kapton XC was ~0.008 which represents about 3 percent of
the maximum strain. The stress on the sample was about 24 percent of the tensile strength. This does not
appear to be a signiﬁcant amount of strain on the material but it is enough to cause a difference in the
appearance of the erosion of the material due to oxidation by atomic oxygen. Figure 15 shows side-by-
side SEM images at 450 tilt of the stressed (UV-S-Z) sample of Kapton XC on the left and the unstressed

sample than the unstressed sample as can be seen in the top 2/3s of the image. The bottom 1/3 was under
the sample mount and protected from erosion by atomic oxygen. As can be seen from the image, the
unstressed sample is only slightly different in appearance to the unexposed surface, while the surface of
the stressed sample has undergone very noticeable erosion.
Conclusmns

Initial observation of the polymer samples ﬂown on the ram and wake sides of MISSE 6 as part of the
polymer ﬁlm tensile experiment (PFTE) show that the environmental exposure of polymers under stress
can produce noticeable physical changes that are not observed when exposed to the same environment but
not under stress. Samples coated with silicon dioxide and silicon showed evidence of cracking while
under stress. The cracking can lead to failure of the underlying polymer if they are exposed to atomic
oxygen, and if the ﬂuence is high enough to cause enough erosion of the polymer at these coating defect
sites to weaken it. This appeared to be the cause of failure for the SiOX coated Kapton ﬂown on the ram
side of MISSE 6. The failure of polymers such as VDA/CPl appears to be dependent on the level of
environment exposure. VDA/CPl samples under stress exposed on the ram side of MISSE 6 failed while
the sample exposed under stress on the wake side did not. For some polymers such as black Kapton (XC),
the rate of erosion due to atomic oxygen arrival appears to increase with the stress applied to the polymer.
SEM photos of the Kapton XC samples show very little erosion on the unstressed samples, but noticeable
surface texturing under slight stress, and almost complete erosion under stresses greater than the tensile
yield stress. Further testing will be conducted to determine the effect of the environment and stress level
on the mechanical properties of these materials.

14. ABSTRACT
The Polymer Film Tensile Experiment (PFTE) was ﬂown as part of Materials International Space Station Experiment 6 (MISSE 6). The purpose of the experiment was to
expose a variety of polymer ﬁlms to the low Earth orbital environment under both relaxed and tension conditions. The polymers selected are those commonly used for
spacecraft thermal control and those under consideration for use in spacecraft applications such as sunshields, solar sails, and inﬂatable and deployable structures. The dog-
bone shaped samples of polymers that were ﬂown were exposed on both the side of the MISSE 6 Passive Experiment Container (PEC) that was facing into the ram direction
(receiving atomic oxygen, ultraviolet (UV) radiation, ionizing radiation, and thermal cycling) and the wake facing side (which was supposed to have experienced
predominantly the same environmental effects except for atomic oxygen which was present due to reorientation of the International Space Station). A few of the tensile
samples were coated with vapor deposited aluminum 0n the back and wired to determine the point in the ﬂight when the tensile sample broke as recorded by a change in
voltage that was stored on battery powered data loggers for post ﬂight retrieval and analysis. The data returned on the data loggers was not usable. However, post retrieval
observation and analysis of the samples was performed. This paper describes the preliminary analysis and observations of the polymers exposed on the MISSE 6 PFTE.
