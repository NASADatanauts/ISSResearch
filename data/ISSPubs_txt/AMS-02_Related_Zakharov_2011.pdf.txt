1 Introduction
The ﬁrst large—scale superconducting magnet system of Alfa Magnetic Spectrometer (AMS—02) was designed to
measure in space a high energy particles inside of AMS volume N 1 m3 (a similar, but permanent magnet system
AMS—Ol Will be installed soon onboard International Space Station — 188). In addition, outside of AMS’s a lot of
plasma phenomena Within a range up to N 10 m can originate [1] from the interaction of residual magnetic ﬁeld
around AMS (Characterized by effective moment to N 107G*Cm3) With the ionospheric plasma overﬂowing 188
(With velocity V0 % 8 km/s and density n N 3*105 crn_3 of O+—ions). Therefore there is a possibility for the
formation of Shabansky’ Magnisphere [2] under conditions of sub—Alfvenic and super—sonic ﬂow of very rareﬁed
plasma, With the ion—inertial scale length C/wpz- N 1 km >> other main scales of the problem — magnetopause
stand—off Rmp, Stoermer radius Cst and even 188 size (L N 100 rn). To date, physics of plasma — dipole interac—
tion for the indicated conditions is practically unknown. Further, laboratory experiments and PIC simulations are
required to clarify it [1]. In particular it is primary of importance to identify Where is a point of plasma stop and
its potential drop as well as induced wave activities or turbulence. These events are potentially dangerous for 188
environment, however now they can be registered by Russian “Obstanovka” [3] equipment at ISS. Our results
[1] of 3D/PIC—sirnulations, relevant Hall—model and presented measurements reveal a plasma penetration up to
Stoermer scale With the pronounced effects of plasma and ﬁeld perturbations, if ion scale AZ- 2 C/wpz- is larger
than a usual Rmp one.

2 Experimental Conditions and Setup
We have started laboratory simulation [1] of AMS—ISS problem at the KI—l facility [1, 4] of ILP with a large—scale
high—Vacuum Chamber 01.2 rn, supplied by dipole u 2 105 G*Crn3, ﬂow of high—speed plasma (V0 N 50+100
km/s and n N 1011+1013 crn_3 ) and systems of ﬂoating and heated [5] Langmuir Probes (LP) With a Tungsten
and Platinum Wire With the radius rp é 50pm (N AD, Debye length) for low density case n g 1012 cm_3.
The main diagnostic problem of plasma With high V0 in the presence of magnetic ﬁeld B (similar to our [5 +8]
and other laser—produced plasma’ studies) is a large level of electrostatic pickups onto probes and their Circuits,

immersed into the plasma with potential 905 up to mV02/2e N kV at Az- < Rmp [5]. T0 diminish them we need
to minimize a total capacitance between the probe and plasma, by using a special design [6] of probe shielding
and its Circuit or output — for LP, the reference electrode of which has a ﬂoating potential (I) f N 905 due to direct
contact with plasma.

These difﬁcult probe measurements conditions originate from the general goal of simulative experiment and
its relevant design (Fig. 1) with the parameters [1], chosen on the base of main used similarity criteria [7, 10] for
the dipole—plasma problem (See Table 1).

To obtain required parameters we applied a 7r—theorern of dimensionless analysis stating that from a number
N of parameters (including constants e and C), one could combine only (N — 3) independent criteria. Their
experimental values are in agreement with ionospheric ones (according to principle of “Limited Scaling” [10]),
excluding Alfven Mach number Ma > 1 versus sub—Alfvenic case of 188 (see Table 1). This Ma—Value was
Chosen speciﬁcally to verify a possibility to form in such regime of 188 (or other cases [11]) with D : Rmp/AZ- <
1, a possible kV—jump of potential 90p near Rmp (as in the usual case of D > 1). A Stoermer radius 05,: =
( ze/i/mVOC)1/ 2 E (Rip/Aiﬂﬂ determines a minimal distance X515 N O.4+O.6Cst between ,u and trajectory of
ions.

To measure low plasma density by LP in a presence of kV—jump as well as magnetic B and electric E ﬁeld’
distributions and ﬂuctuations, we apply a wide bandwidth (up to wpi/27T N 300 MHZ), miniature and shielded
B—dot magnetic Probes (BP, up to (Z) 3 mm) and ﬂoating reference electrode of LP. Galvanic decoupling of double
LP was done [6] by opto—isolators (rise—time < 100 ns) and shielded transformers or Rogowski coil (up to N
1+ 10 ns).

To Check a presence of heaVier ions which could affect the calculation estimation of true ion’s energy Wi, we
had developed a new method to estimate their mass Via simple relation m / z (a.rn.u.) 2 {J22 (U ) / 1 an2 /dU 1 — 1

3 Experimental Results and Discussion
Experiment “Dipole” for simulation of ionospheric conditions for dipole overﬂowing by rareﬁed plasma at two
regimes of D < 1 (see Table 1) was done at KI—l facility of ILP with quasi—stationary (at times 2 3 ,us) and
quasi—uniforrn H+—ﬂow of transverse diameter N 50+6O cm (Fig. 1). All measurements were done by 2 systems
of combined pairs of probes LP+BP. One system (with LP’s N 5 mm) was moving in equatorial XY—plane (#3a,b
in Fig. 1) and second — in meridional one (#5 in Fig. 1) to measure low densities n and Hall—ﬁeld ABy. All LP’s
were used in the OML—regime for ion current Jz- o< 2m 1 U 11/2 to LP—wire at potentials — U 2 150 V.

LP—data on density distributions (Fig. 2) Clearly show that in both regimes of PF1,2 plasma can propagate only
up to the distance of its front Rm N 6+7 cm, which is comparable with the Stoermer scale X 3t, instead of MHD
stand—off at Rmp % 12.5 cm. This data is a ﬁrst experimental evidence of such plasma behaVior near the dipole
at D < 1, that was discovered by PIC—modeling [12] of “Magnetic Sail” (MS). Later it was conﬁrmed by PIC—
modeling of the non—MHD magnetopause position effect at Rmm > Rmp, observed in a laser plasma experiment
at D N 0.3 [1]. Here this non—MHD effect of magnetopause position at was investigated in details (Fig. 3) with a

similar weak dependence for Rma, (18 cm at D1 % 0.75 and 21 cm at D2 m 0.45), quantitatively corresponding to
the asymptotic relation Rmm/Rmp o< 1/D1/4 of new Hall model [1]. This model also predicts a plasma boundary

Independent evidence of such kind of non—MHD magnetopause could be an electrodynarnic Ampere force
FA acting from plasma ﬂow to the dipole ,u Via magnetic disturbance ABZ, according to usual expression FAQ,
2 [MVBZ] and evaluation of gradient “in average” as VBZ m AOB/AX by BP—measurements (see Fig. 3). To
compare “Dipole” data on FAQ, with other known results such as well—developed MS—study [12, 13], this data need

to be expressed in the relevant dimensionless form of drag coefﬁcient Cd : FAQ, / % >|< 7r(1.5 Rm)2. Thus, if
in a “zero” approximation to determine VBZ Via Characteristic AB+N ,u/Riw and AX N Rma, o< Rmp/D1/4, we
could obtain a simple relation for thrust as Cd o< D, just the same as was founded in PIC—modeling of MS [12]
at D << 1 by Changes in particles momenta. This linear dependence Cd(D) at D < 1 is presented in Fig. 5 in
comparison with the experimental MS—data [13] and “Dipole” ones. Our latest data give a ﬁrst evidence of the
high efﬁciency of MS.
4 Conclusions
A11 presented and other [9, 12] data conﬁrm expected relatioanm/Rmp o< 1/D1/4 of Hall—model [1], in contrast
to recent experiments [14] and relevant PIC—rnodeling [15], in which at M a g 3 and D up to N 0.1, were obtained
Rmm N Rmp. Our results of the ﬁrst “Dipole” experiment on simulation of AMSO2—ISS problem determined a
new, enlarged scale Rmm of magnetopause in a low—density plasma ﬂows with a C/wp; > Rmp and Ma > 1. This
scale is in agreement with our own PIC—modeling [1] by Hybrid code [9] of Kyushu University (KU), including
Hall terms. For the conditions of 188 (in Table 1) we could expect a drop of ACIDf é Wi/ezNIO V, a range
Rmm N 35 In (of AB+—jump N20 nT) and the distance of plasma penetration up to X515 N 0.5 0515 N 0.5 m. A
new method suggested in the end of Part 2 for estimation of m/z of ions by OML probe differs from well—known
ones in ionospheric [16] and laboratory [17] researches. It is more simple, but needs a very careful measurements
of J;(U) and Cleaning [6] of probe surface.
