Abstract: The study of the evolution of organic matter subjected to space conditions, and more speciﬁcally

to Solar photons in the vacuum ultraviolet range (120—200 nm) has been undertaken in low-Earth orbit since

the 1990s, and implemented on various space platforms. This paper describes a photochemistry experiment

called AMINO, conducted during 22 months between 2009 and 2011 on the EXPOSE-R ESA facility,

outside the International Space Station. Samples with relevance to astrobiology (connected to comets,

carbonaceous meteorites and micrometeorites, the atmosphere of Titan and RNA world hypothesis) have

been selected and exposed to space environment. They have been analysed after return to the Earth. This

paper is not discussing the results of the experiment, but rather gives a general overview of the project, the

details of the hardware used, its conﬁguration and recent developments to enable long-duration exposure of

gaseous samples in tight closed cells enabling for the ﬁrst time to derive quantitative results from gaseous

phase samples exposed in space.
