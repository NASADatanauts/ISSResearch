Coarsening is the growth of larger particles at the expense of smaller ones in a two-phase
system of varying particle sizes. Solid-liquid mixtures are ideal systems with which to study
the process of coarsening. When the experiments are conducted on Earth, gravity leads to
particle sedimentation. Conducting the experiments in a zero-gravity environment would
eliminate the particle sedimentation. A series of samples consisting of solid tin particles
embedded in a tin—lead liquid matrix were coarsened at the Microgravity Glove box at
the International Space Station (188). The experiment of interest was conducted in June
2010. The effects of the residual microgravity acceleration on particle sedimentation are
investigated. It is observed that there is signiﬁcant sedimentation, compared to the average
particle size, as a result of the residual microgravity acceleration. We also ﬁnd that the
mass transport during coarsening was diffusion driven despite the sedimentation.

I. Introduction
Given a tWO—phase system With varying particle sizes, the larger particles tend to grow at the expense of
the smaller ones. This process, called coarsening or Ostwald ripening, is a way for the system to minimize its
energy by decreasing the total interfacial area through mass transport. As a result, the average particle size
Within the system increases over time. Coarsening is observed during processing of metal alloys and therefore
is a common problem When these alloys are used in applications that require elevated temperatures. The
theory of coarsening was established by Lifshitz and Slyozov,2 and Wagner3 in 19608. The theory predicts
the coarsening rate of the system in the limit of inﬁnite coarsening time. In this limit the system attains a
steady state wherein the kinetics are deﬁned by temporal power laws and time independent scaled particle
size distributions.

"2","Solid—liquid mixtures are ideal systems for tests of coarsening theory. For examples, the interfacial energy
is isotropic and the rapid diffusion through the liquid phase assures that there will be signiﬁcant coarsening
in reasonable experimental time. However, experiments involving solid—liquid systems usually suffer from
a density difference between the solid and the liquid. Accordingly, the gravity of the Earth causes the Sn
particles to sediment to the top of the sample in a short time. Since testing the theory of coarsening calls
for longer experiments, it is not possible to conduct them on Earth. A ground processed sample is shown in
Figure 1(a), where the sedimentation of the particles to the top of the sample is Clearly Visible.

The ideal environment for such an experiment is a zero—gravity environment, under which the particle
sedimentation would disappear and the solid particles would be evenly distributed in the liquid until the
steady state is reached. The Miorogravity Glove Box at the International Space Station (ISS) provides a near—
zero gravity environment, minimizing the effect of gravity on the system and therefore making testing the
theory possible. However, there are small residual accelerations acting on the system. In order to support
the scientiﬁc experiments and to better determine the experimental conditions, the International Space
Station is equipped with the Microgravity Acceleration Measurement System (MAMS). MAMS measures
residual microgravity accelerations that occur as a result conditions such as general experiment operation,
crew activity and rotational effects.1 Being a bigger force, the effects of Earth’s gravity on the experiments
is obvious. On the other hand, the effects of this residual microgravity acceleration on the coarsening
experiments and if they lead to particle sedimentation is unknown.

hours and 10 minutes at 1850C in a liquid (black), (a) on ground, (b) at the Microgravity Glove box at ISS
during CSLM I. The Sn—particles are less dense than the liquid, so they sediment to the top of the sample.
II. Experimental Procedure

Pb—Sn alloys are well studied, mostly due to their low melting point (1830C), isotropic interfacial energy
and rapid coarsening rates, making it ideal for coarsening studies. The samples were prepared using a method
previously used by Hardy and Voorhees.4 The samples consisted of solid, almost spherical Sn particles
embedded in a Pb—Sn eutectic matrix. A number of experiments were conducted at the Microgravity Glove
Box at the ISS. The particular experiment analyzed was from J une 2010, sample processing unit 5, which had
a length of approximately 34 hours, and was from GMT174/ 17.45 to GMT 176/ 04.26. In the microgravity
environment, the samples were ﬁrst heated up to solid—liquid regime. They were then held at 1850C, 20C
above the eutectic temperature, for varying coarsening times and quenched. An ISS processed sample is
shown in Figure 1(b). Some of the results were discussed in an earlier paper by Kammer et. al.5

The residual microgravity acceleration data from MAMS were studied for the sample with 30% volume

Technologies at the Microgravity Glove BOX location, and interpolation to bridge data gaps during times
where there was a loss of signal we computed the sedimentation 0f the particles in the system.

Using the mapped MAMS acceleration data, the Stoke’s sedimentation velocity can be determined at
each time step using,

had shown 751/3 dependence of R5 Furthermore, the particle size distribution is not monodisperse. Given the
strong dependence of the sedimentation rate on particle radius, we examine the velocities and displacements
for representative particle radii in the distribution. These relations are summarized by equations 2. Using
the relations shown in equation 2 along with V, the displacement was calculated in X, Y and Z directions
separately, assuming, for each, minimum particle size, average particle size and maximum particle size.

III. Results

Figure 2 shows the residual microgravity acceleration with respect to time. The accelerations vary
strongly with time and are less than 1 ,ug most of the time. The resulting displacements of each particle
with respect to time are also shown. It is observed that while the body of particles tend to remain stable
with respect to the acceleration in X and Y directions, they do have a relatively signiﬁcant displacement
resulting from the acceleration in the Z direction. Despite the small accelerations, over the length of the
experiment signiﬁcant particle sedimentation is possible. The particle displacement is smooth compared to
the acceleration data because the duration of these larger accelerations is very small and thus induces nearly
no change in the particle location.

These ﬁndings are also supported by the results shown in Figures 3 and 4. Figure 3 shows the magnitude
of velocity at each time step for Ravg, Rmm and Rmam, in blue, green and red respectively. The smaller
particles, shown using the green line, tend to be more stable than the bigger particles, with a velocity Close
to 0. The overall velocity is increasing over time and although it is very small, is on the order of 10—8m/3.
This velocity still gives rise to a relatively signiﬁcant displacement, shown in Figure 4.

Figure 4 shows the magnitude of displacement at each time step for Raw, Rmm and Rmam, again, in
blue, green and red respectively. This plot supports the observation that the smaller particles remain stable,
with almost no Change in overall displacement, while the larger particles tend to move within the matrix.
The overall displacement values are on the order of 10—4m. Given that the average particle radius is around
85 microns, the displacement is signiﬁcant with respect to the particle sizes. Thus, these larger particles
sediment through a comparatively stationary array of smaller particles.

These ﬁndings raises the question of whether the mass transport during coarsening is Via diffusion or
convection. The dimensionless Peclet number can be calculated using equation 3. The value of the constant
D was given in Table 1.

Figure 3. Magnitude of Stoke’s velocity With respect to time
A smaller Peclet number points to a diffusion driven mass transportation while a larger one signiﬁes a
convection dominated mass transport process.6 Although showing a slightly different trend for Rwy, Rmm
and Rmax, the Peclet numbers calculated from this data are on the order of 10—3, and are therefore small.
It can be concluded that although the residual microgravity acceleration does effect the displacement of the
larger particles, the mass transport during coarsening remains diffusion driven.
IV. Summary
A 30% volume fraction Pb—Sn sample was coarsened in the Microgravity Glove BOX on the International
Space Station for 34 hours. During the experiment, the residual microgravity acceleration data was also
recorded using Microgravity Acceleration Measurement System. It was found that the residual microgravity
acceleration had signiﬁcant effect on the location of larger particles, but the coarsening process remained
diffusion driven.
