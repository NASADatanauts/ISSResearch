Fig. 1. Four—step model for light ﬂash generation: (1) the ionizing radiation is impinging in the eye; (2) radicals are generated in the eye; most of them are quenched; (3) some of the
radicals generated in the rod lipids undergo lipid peroxidation which result in chemiluminescence, and in the emission of a photon; (4) the photon bleaches a nearby rhodopsin: the
photo—transduction cascade is started, a light ﬂash can be perceived. The dashed arrows indicate the presented experimental tests.
