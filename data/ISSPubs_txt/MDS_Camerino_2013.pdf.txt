Abstract
Pleiotrophin (PTN) is a widespread cytokine involved in bone formation, neurite outgrowth, and angiogenesis. In skeletal
muscle, PTN is upregulated during myogenesis, post-synaptic induction, and regeneration after crushing, but little is known
regarding its effects on muscle function. Here, we describe the effects of PTN on the s|ow-twitch soleus and fast-twitch
extensor digitorum longus (EDL) muscles in mice over-expressing PTN under the control of a bone promoter. The mice were
maintained in normal loading or disuse condition, induced by hindlimb unloading (HU) for 14 days. Effects of exposition to
near-zero gravity during a 3-months spaceflight (SF) into the Mice Drawer System are also reported. In normal loading, PTN
overexpression had no effect on muscle fiber cross-sectional area, but shifted soleus muscle toward a slower phenotype, as
shown by an increased number of oxidative type 1 fibers, and increased gene expression of cytochrome c oxidase subunit
IV and citrate synthase. The cytokine increased soleus and EDL capillary-to-fiber ratio. PTN overexpression did not prevent
soleus muscle atrophy, s|ow-to-fast transition, and capillary regression induced by SF and HU. Nevertheless, PTN exerted
various effects on sarcolemma ion channel expression/function and resting cytosolic Ca2+ concentration in soleus and EDL
muscles, in normal loading and after HU. In conclusion, the results show very similar effects of HU and SF on mouse soleus
muscle, including activation of specific gene programs. The EDL muscle is able to counterbalance this latter, probably by
activating compensatory mechanisms. The numerous effects of PTN on muscle gene expression and functional parameters
demonstrate the sensitivity of muscle fibers to the cytokine. Although |itt|e benefit was found in HU muscle disuse, PTN may
emerge useful in various muscle diseases, because it exerts synergetic actions on muscle fibers and vessels, which could
enforce oxidative metabolism and ameliorate muscle performance.
