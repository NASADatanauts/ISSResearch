This paper is concerned With forced ﬂow through partially open capillary Channels
under microgravity conditions. The investigated Channel consists of two parallel
plates and is bounded by free liquid surfaces along the open sides. The curvature of
the channel’s gas—liquid interface, Which is exposed to the ambient pressure, adjusts
to the pressure difference across the interface in accordance With the Young—Laplace
equation. Flow Within the Channel becomes unstable When the free surface collapses
and gas ingestion into the ﬂow path occurs—a process that is also referred to as
the “choking” phenomenon. During stable ﬂow, the behavior of the free surface
is inﬂuenced by ﬂow conditions, geometric properties of the Channel, and the pre—
deﬁned system pressure. In this work, a previously published stability theory is
veriﬁed for a Wide range of model parameters. A detailed study is provided for stable
ﬂow in capillary channels, including static and dynamic solutions. The results of the
Capillary Channel Flow (CCF) experiment are evaluated and are found to agree well
with numerical predictions. A Clear limit is determined between stable and unstable
ﬂows. It is shown that the model can predict the shape of the free surface under
various ﬂow conditions. A numerical tool is employed to exploit the mathematical
model, and the general behavior of free surfaces in said capillary Channels is studied.
Studies are conducted in both Viscous and convective ﬂow regimes and in the
transition area between the two. The validity of the model is conﬁrmed for a Wide
range of geometrical conﬁgurations and parameters. (C) 2015 AIP Publishing LLC.

I. INTRODUCTION

Capillary Channels With free surfaces are Widely used in terrestrial and space applications. EX—
emplary devices that rely on capillary effects are surface tension tanks,1 heat pipes,2 lab—on—a—Chip
devices,3 and micro—Channels in cooling devices.4 In spacecraft propellant management systems,5
capillary techniques are employed to acquire the liquid propellant and to preserve a continuous,
bubble—free path between a fuel bulk and an outlet to the thruster.6 Hydrostatic pressure is negligible
under microgravity conditions and the inﬂuence of other forces dominates the behavior of the free
surface. The liquid remains Within the Channel due to adhesion and cohesion and the resulting
capillary pressure. Once the ﬂow rate Within the Channel has exceeded a certain value, the pressure
difference between the liquid and the gas phase is no longer balanced by the curvature of the free
surface. As a consequence, the free surface loses its stability leading to a collapse and gas ingestion
into the ﬂow path. Two phase ﬂow caused by gas ingestion could be unfavorable for certain applica—
tions. For this reason, it is important to understand the inﬂuence of the geometry of the Channel and
0f the ﬂow Within it on the behavior of the free surface.

Early research on capillary Channel ﬂow under microgravity conditions dates back to drop
tower experiments on the liquid rise between two parallel plates.7 Theoretical, numerical, and exper—
imental investigations of forced ﬂow between parallel plates were performed including drop tower

and sounding rocket ﬂights and the development of a one—dimensional (1D) ﬂow model.8 Model and
experiments conﬁrm that free surfaces lose their stability When the critical volumetric ﬂow rate is
exceeded. Limitation of the ﬂow rate occurs due to the Choking effect, Which is analogous to the
well known choking phenomenon in compressible ﬂow in ducts.9

The 1D, steady model comprises both radii of curvature, the convective acceleration due to the
Change in cross—section, and the Viscous pressure loss Within the Channel. The limited test duration
of previous experiments has left many important issues unaddressed. The CCF experiment aboard
the International Space Station (188)10 provides a unique opportunity to thoroughly validate the
theory and probe limits Within a multidimensional parameter space. The ﬂow model can then be
employed to evaluate the general behavior of the gas—liquid interface Which is beyond the physical
constraints of the CCF experiment. This paper focuses on the investigation of the interfaces for
steady ﬂow With stable free surfaces. Section 11 provides an overview on the theoretical model,
Where the fundamental equations relevant to this study are addressed. The CCF experiment hard—
ware is shortly introduced in Sec. III. Experiment results are presented and discussed in comparison
with numerical predictions in Sec. IV. A general discussion about free surface interfaces between
parallel plates under different ﬂow conditions follows in Sec. V.
II. THEORETICAL MODEL

In the following, a brief overview is presented of the model assumptions, scaling details, and
governing equations. A more detailed description of the model can be found in Refs. 8 and 11.
Forced liquid ﬂow through an open capillary Channel consisting of two parallel plates is considered,
as shown in Figure 1(a). The Channel has a Width b, and a gap distance a. The ﬂow along the
x—aXis is driven by the pump. TWO free liquid surfaces are formed along the ﬂow path. The length
l of the open section is deﬁned by movable sliders on either side. The model predicts the free
surface contour k(x) along the Channel at steady ﬂow conditions. The origin of the coordinate
system is located at the center of the inlet cross—section area (x = O). The ﬂow is assumed to be
one—dimensional along x. The test liquid is Newtonian, and perfectly wetting With the contact angle
of 0°. The incompressible ﬂow is considered to be under isothermal conditions. The maximum
Reynolds number (Re 2 (th)/v, Where v is the average ﬂow velocity, Dh is the hydraulic diam—
eter, and v is the kinematic Viscosity) in the experiment is Re < 900. Therefore, ﬂow is assumed
to be laminar. The hydrostatic pressure caused by acceleration g is considered to be negligible.

scenarios at the Channel inlet are considered in this study: (i) fully developed ﬂow With a parabolic

represent two extremes of the inlet ﬂow conditions Which bracket all intermediate scenarios of a
developing ﬂow. The volumetric ﬂow rate Q 2 Av is constant along the Channel (in x direction).

ing to the ﬂow conditions. K1 and K2 describe the pressure loss in the nozzle up to the Channel
inlet (x = O) and are determined numerically by three—dimensional simulations of the ﬂow in the
inlet section of the CCF setup.14 Velocity 00 is the mean ﬂow velocity at the Channel inlet. The
cross—section area A0 at the Channel inlet is equal to the cross—section area A1 at the Channel eXit,
thus 00 = 01 (see Eq. (3)).
III. EXPERIMENT
The CCF experiment was performed aboard the 188 for 66 days. After the hardware instal—
lation and commissioning, the entire CCF experiment was controlled remotely by the principal
investigators Via telescience. In the following, a brief overview of the experiment setup is given.
A detailed description of the experiment hardware has been published in Ref. 10. The key part of
the CCF experiment unit is the test Channel with ﬁxed a = 5 mm and b = 25 mm, as shown in
Figure 1(a). Movable sliders are used to vary the length of the open section of the Channel in a
range of 5 mm < l’ < 48 mm. The test liquid is 3MTM NovecTM Engineered Fluid HFE—7500 with
properties as listed in Table II. This test liquid was Chosen because of its wetting behavior (the static
contact angle with glass is 0°). The liquid surfaces of the open Channel and the compensation tube
are exposed to the ambient pressure pa, as depicted in Figure 1(b). A high speed high resolution
(HSHR) camera is used to capture the gas—liquid interface in the open section of the capillary
Channel, Figure 3. The camera is pointed perpendicular to the test Channel walls. Gray—scale images
(example shown in Figure 3) are converted into binary images aboard the ISS and downloaded for
the further evaluation. The goal of the image processing is the determination of the free surface
contour k as a (discrete) function of the spatial coordinate x along the open capillary Channel and 0f
the time I.
IV. EVALUATION OF THE CCF EXPERIMENT RESULTS—VALIDATION OF THE
MATHEMATICAL MODEL
A. Critical flow rate
An essential goal of the CCF experiment is determining maximum forced ﬂow rates which are
possible for given Channel lengths before the free surfaces of the ﬂowing liquid become unstable.
This is accomplished by increasing the ﬂow rate in small steps (quasi steady). The critical ﬂow
rate QC is deﬁned as the maximum ﬂow rate at which a stable interface is observed. Values of the

critical ﬂow rate for different Channel lengths are determined experimentally and compared With a
1D model, see Figure 4. The Clear limit between the stable and unstable ﬂow regime is identiﬁed.
The critical ﬂow rate decreases With increasing Channel length. This decrease appears hyperbolic
for channels With l g 8 and almost linear for channels with l > 8. For suﬂicient short Channels, the
reversible convective pressure dominates over the irreversible Viscous pressure losses. Smaller pres—
sure losses result in higher values of the critical ﬂow rate. A comparison between the experimental
and computational results shows very good agreement for channels I > 7.2 With a deviation of less
than 5%. For short Channels, the discrepancy between the experiment and computation increases
With decreasing Channel length.
B. Free surface profiles
The 1D model can also be used to determine the contour of the free surface for ﬂow rates that
do not exceed QC. During the CCF experiments With the parallel plates Channel, it was observed
that both free surfaces behave identically during subcritical ﬂow. Based on this observation, we Will

assume symmetry Within the Channel With respect to the x, y—plane (z = 0) and limit the following
discussion to only one free surface and to ﬂow rates of Q g QC. Figure 5 shows a comparison
of experiment data and numerical predictions of the contour k of the free surface at QC. As eX—
plained above, the curvature of the free surface reaches its highest value at the critical ﬂow rate.
Representative short (Figure 5(a)), medium (Figures 5(b) and 5(C)), and long Channels (Figure 5(d))
are Chosen for comparison. As shown in Figure 5(a), for short Channels, the contour of the free
surface is almost symmetrical With respect to the Channel center (x = 0.5). As the Channel length
increases, the contour of the free surface becomes increasingly asymmetrical (Figures 5(C) and
5(d)). The Changing shape of the free surface With increasing Channel length is a consequence of
different physical regimes that inﬂuence the ﬂow (to be discussed later in Sec. V B 3). To aid further
examination of the free surface’s contour, a minimum contour point km1n(x*,k*) is introduced and is
deﬁned as the lowest point of the free surface. This point coincides With the location of the mini—
mum cross—section area Where the ﬁrst derivative of the contour is zero (dxk = 0). As noted above,
kmm is located in the vicinity of x = 0.5 for short Channels and is typical for convective dominated
symmetrical proﬁles. As the Channel length is increased, the longitudinal coordinate x* of kmm shifts
towards the Channel outlet see Fig. 6. As the Channel length increased, the deformation of the free
surface also increases due to this shifting of kmm towards the Channel outlet. In the experiments
(EXP), k* increases with l for channels with l > 3.6. The same trend is observed for results of the

will be shown later that for suﬂiciently long Channels, k* = 4 is a minimum value that is based on
the Channel geometry. Some examples of raw HSHR images of the test Channel With free surfaces
are shown in Figure 17 (Appendix).
C. Weaknesses of the mathematical model
As shown above, the 1D model generally predicts the shape of free surface proﬁles and values
of the critical ﬂow rate well for ﬂow between parallel plates under microgravity conditions. It
does, however, overestimate critical ﬂow rates for short channels I < 7.2 (Figure 4). Furthermore,
the predicted contour of the free surface proﬁles is slightly shifted to the left towards the Channel
entrance (Figure 5). These differences reveal the weaknesses of the 1D model and its assumptions.
These are shortly addressed in the following. During the experiments on sounding rocket TEXUS,
the ﬂow separation phenomenon was observed for ﬂow between parallel plates.15 Tracer particles
were used to study the behavior of the ﬂow. For internal ﬂows such as CCF, the separation of the
boundary layer (in the vicinity of the downstream part of the interface) causes an increase of the
pressure loss.16 The 1D model does not account for such a pressure loss. This could explain the
overestimation of the critical ﬂow rate for short Channels. In addition at the Channel inlet, the wall
boundary condition Changes from no—slip to slip, due to the presence of the free surface. Therefore,
it takes a certain Channel length for the ﬂow to adjust to the new boundary conditions. The existence
of such an adjustment region17 adds more complexity to the entire ﬂow, especially When the Channel
is short.
V. GENERAL BEHAVIOR OF THE GAS-LIQUID INTERFACES IN OPEN CAPILLARY
CHANNELS
Section IV provides validation of the mathematical model used for the prediction of the
behavior of the gas—liquid interface between parallel plates in forced ﬂow under microgravity condi—
tions. Furthermore, it is shown that the critical ﬂow rate and free surface contours can be predicted
with the 1D model. In general, the shape of the interface is inﬂuenced by geometric constraints, the
system pressure, and ﬂow conditions. A number of numerical computations are performed in order
to study the effects of these parameters and to exploit the mathematical model. In the following,

we assume developed ﬂow at the Channel entrance and pinned free surfaces. Three scenarios are
considered: (i) static solution, no ﬂow; (ii) dynamic solution, ﬂow rate variation; (iii) dynamic
solution, Channel length variation.
A. Static solution
Reducing the ﬂow in the Channel to the static problem presents a possibility to study the inﬂu—
ence of geometric constraints and boundary conditions on the behavior of the gas—liquid interface.
With no ﬂow, the pressure is constant over the length of the Channel and the free surface has a
constant mean curvature along x. The momentum Eq. (2) reduces to
_ d_p = d_h = O, (12)
dx dx
Which means that the mean curvature h along the Channel is dictated by the curvature boundary
condition ho
_ _ _ l l
pa—p—h—hO—(E+E)=Const. (13)
For the static solution, this equation applies everywhere along the free surface. Furthermore, Eq.
(10) reduces to h(x = 0) 2 K0. Therefore, the curvature in the Channel is only a function of the
system pressure induced by the meniscus in the compensation tube. Figure 6 shows static free
surface contours for different Channel lengths, Where K0 2 0.166 and A = 5, as in the CCF exper—
iment. For the sake of comparison, both non—dimensional and dimensional quantities are depicted.
With increasing the Channel length, the indentation 0f the free surface also increases. For channels
I > 7.2, the minimum contour height k maintains the same level in the middle part of the proﬁle, see
Figure 6(b). Here, the ﬂat part of the proﬁle in the vicinity of the Channel center can be identiﬁed.
Another feature that can be identiﬁed When dimensional values of the free surface contour are
considered (Figure 6(a)) is the free surface contour slope dxk’ at the Channel entrance. The slop is
dictated by the curvature (Eq. (10)) at the Channel entrance and appears identical for all channel
lengths. Further increase of the length of the open section above I = 7.2 (l’ = 18 mm) leads to the
extension of the middle ﬂat part of the proﬁle.
There are, however, some limits in the mean curvature at the Channel inlet beyond Which
a stable, pinned free surface fails to exist even for zero ﬂow conditions. The externally applied

pressure difference K0 is limited by the physical conditions of the interface in the channel. The
free surface curvature is related to the free surface displacement d = b/ 2 — k, as shown in Figure 7.

leads to a pressure decrease. The lowermost curve in Figure 8 represents the shortest Channel exam—
ined here, for which 1’ = a and F = 0.5. In this case, both mean curvature components contribute
equally and hmaX = 2.

Furthermore, the minimum value of k* can be calculated as [9:111 = kmax — dmax. The maximum
value of kmax is a geometric property that is deﬁned by the Channel wall’s Width b, Where kr’naX
= b/ 2 = 12.5 mm (for CCF setup). The maximum displacement for the pinned free surface is dmax
= 1. Assuming dmax = 1 and kmax = 5, the minimum value of k* is [9:111 = 4. This value corresponds
With the CCF experiment results shown in Figure 9, where for long channels the vertical coordinate
of the kmm point k* ~ 4. It conﬁrms the assumption that the minimal contour point of the free
surface is a geometrical quantity. At dmax = 1, the interface reaches its maximum curvature for a
pinned free surface.

Furthermore, the individual components of the mean curvature are evaluated. At the Channel
entrance and eXit, the free surface is pinned at the edges of the slider and 0f the Channel. Thus, the

FIG. 10. Mean curvature components 1/R1, 1 /R2 (computed using Eqs. (6) and (7)) along x. Since no ﬂow is present, the
mean curvature adjusts to the curvature boundary condition at the channel entrance kg = 0.166 (according to Eq. (13)).
Characteristic short (I = 2) and long (I = 18) channels are chosen for comparison. For long channels, the term 1/R2 —> 0 in
the middle part of the free surface (between x z 0.2 and x z 0.8). This is the indicator of the ﬂat proﬁle section Where the
dxxk —> 0.

ﬁrst principal radius R1 —> 00 and as a consequence the component 1/R1 —> 0 at x = 0 and x = 1
(Figure 10). To satisfy Eq. (13), the second curvature term must balance the pressure boundary
condition, thus 1 /R2 —> 0.166 2 kg at the Channel entrance and eXit. For the Channel With l = 2, the
curvature is supported by both radii at any point 0 < x < 1. For the channel With l = 18, the ﬂat,
middle proﬁle part can be identiﬁed Where R2 —> 00. Thus, 1 /R2 —> 0 between x z 0.2 and x z 0.8.
Here, only the radius perpendicular to the ﬂow supports the free surface. Consequently, for a long
Channel between x z 0.2 and x z 0.8, the ﬁrst curvature component adjusts to a ﬁxed boundary
condition so 1/R1 —> 0.166 2 kg.

Expanding the study to the Whole range of the Channel lengths (corresponding to the CCF
experiment), it is observed that for Channels 1 < 7.2 both principal radii contribute to the mean
curvature. In this case, the free surface is supported by both radii (1/R1 i 0, 1/R2 i 0). For long
Channels 1 > 7.2, the ﬂat proﬁle part in the middle section can be identiﬁed Where only the ﬁrst
principal radius R1 contributes to the curvature. In this case, the free surface is supported by only
one radius (1/R2 S 0.01 at x = 0.5).

B. Dynamic solution

The inﬂuence of various ﬂow effects on the shape of the free surface can be studied by the vari—
ation of the ﬂow conditions (ﬂow rate and Channel length). The CCF experiment mainly focuses on
the investigation of free surfaces at the critical point Where last stable contours were recorded With
a high speed camera. In the following, the mathematical model is employed in order to examine the
behavior of free surfaces in the stable, subcritical ﬂow regime. A parametric study is performed for
representative Channel lengths. Geometric and liquid properties correspond to the CCF experiment
(Table II) except for the system pressure boundary conditions Which is set to K0 2 0 for the sake of
convenience.

1. Flow rate variation

The ﬂow rate is varied between 0 (no ﬂow) and critical ﬂow rate QC. Representative short
(I = 2) and long (I = 18) Channels are presented.

For the short Channel, free surface proﬁles are almost, but not perfectly (due to friction),
symmetrical With respect to the Channel center (Figure 11(a)). For the long channel, the proﬁles
are asymmetrical and the minimum contour point is shifted towards the Channel eXit (Figure 11(b)).
In general, the deformation of the free surface increases With the increasing ﬂow rate. During the
CCF experiment however, it was observed that a given, constant Change of the ﬂow rate AQ leads
to a different Change of the free surface displacement depending on ﬂow conditions (moderate or
high ﬂow velocities). Results of the numerical simulations conﬁrm this behavior. As can be seen in
Figures 11(a) and 11(b), a 1% increase of the ﬂow rate, from Q / QC 2 0.99 to QC (critical regime),
leads to a higher increase of the free surface displacement than an increase of 10% in the moderate,
subcritical ﬂow regime (Q/QC < 0.95). This illustrates the sensitiVity of the free surface in the
Vicinity of QC Where a small Change of the ﬂow rate leads to a signiﬁcant Change of the free surface
proﬁle.

Furthermore, for stable ﬂow, the mean free surface curvature h along the Channel must balance
the pressure difference between the ﬂowing liquid and the surrounding gas at any point of the
interface according to Eq. (4). As shown in Figures 11(C) and 11(d), the mean curvature increases
With the increase of the free surface displacement along x. For the short Channel, the curvature h
has the same values at the inlet and the outlet, Which is typical for convective dominated ﬂows,
Where reversible pressure loss dominates the momentum balance. Convective acceleration leads to
a pressure decrease between x = 0 and x = x* Which is then recovered between x = x* and x = 1.
For the long Channel, the curvature h reaches higher values at the Channel eXit than at the Channel
entrance Which is as a consequence of the pressure losses attributed to modeled Viscous effects, see
Figure 11(d). This behavior Will be discussed in Sec. V B 3.

representative short channel (I = 2, QC 2 1.27) and the right column for the long channel (I = 18, QC 2 0.79). Following
quantities are depicted: (a) and (b)—free surface contour k, Where circles depict the kmin point at position x*; (c) and

Furthermore, the mean curvature components along x are examined. Figures 12(a) and 12(b)
show the ﬁrst curvature component 1 /R1. For the short Channel, plots are symmetrical With respect
to the Channel center. 1 /R1 reaches its maximum value of l in the middle part of the proﬁle at the
critical ﬂow rate. This geometrical property is discussed in Section V A. Plots of the second curva—
ture component 1 /R2 are shown in Figures 12(C) and 12(d). Also in this case curves are symmetrical
for the short Channel. It is worth noting that for the long channel, the term 1 /R2 —> 0 in the middle
part of the proﬁles for all considered ﬂow rates. Even for the low ﬂow rates Q / QC < 0.1, the free
surface proﬁle has a ﬂat middle part Where 1 /R2 —> O.

2. Channel length variation

In the following, a constant, steady ﬂow rate Q = 0.63 (subcritical ﬂow) is considered in or—
der to distinguish between effects that are typical for subcritical and critical ﬂow. Therefore, the
channel length l is varied in a range of 2 S l S 19.2. Figure 13(a) shows plots of the contour k.
The Clear difference between symmetrical short, and deformed long Channels can be seen. With
increasing Channel length, the free surface displacement also increases. The minimum contour point
kmm decreases, and is shifted towards the Channel exit. For channels I > 4.8, the longitudinal shift

0f the minimum contour point becomes signiﬁcant (x* > 0.5 i 2.5 %). The mean curvature adjusts
to the free surface deformation, as depicted in Figure 13(b). The curvature difference between the
Channel inlet and outlet increases With the increase of the Channel length. First and second curvature
components are shown in Figures 13(C) and 13(d), respectively. It is worth noting that all plots of
l/R2 are symmetrical With respect to the Channel center for all considered Channel lengths. For
channels I > 7.2, the second curvature component l/Rz g 0.01 in the middle part of the proﬁle.
This indicates the presence of the ﬂat proﬁle part in the middle of the Channel. This length corre—
sponds to the Characteristic length identiﬁed using the static solution (Sec. V A), Where for channels
I > 7.2, the ﬂat part of the proﬁle is also present. Regarding the ﬁrst curvature component, plots
are quasi—symmetrical for channels I < 4.8. For longer channels, l/R1 plots deform towards the
Channel eXit.
3. Physical flow regimes
A series of 1D simulations is performed in order to study the inﬂuence of two major ﬂow ef—
fects, i.e., convective acceleration and Viscous pressure loss, on the behavior of the free surface. The

FIG. 13. Typical results of the numerical computation of the ﬂow between parallel plates With a ﬁxed ﬂow rate Q = 0.63.
Channel length is varied between 2 S l S 19.2, Which corresponds to the range of lengths investigated in the CCF
experiment. (a)—free surface contour k; (b)—mean curvature h; (c)—ﬁrst curvature component 1/ R 1; (d)—second curvature
component 1/R2. In (b) and (c) from bottom to top, the values ofl are 2, 2.4, 2.8, 3.2, 4, 4.8, 6, 8, 10, 12, 16, 19.2. In (d)
from top to bottom, the values ofl are 2, 2.4, 2.8, 3.2, 4, 4.8, 6, 8, 10, 12, 16, 19.2.

ﬂow is assumed at its critical rate and the model parameters correspond to the CCF
experiment shown in Table II. A fully developed velocity proﬁle Within the Channel is assumed.
The numerical code provides the steady ﬂow solution of the free surface contour k, ﬂow velocity
0, ﬂow cross—section area A, and the mean curvature h over the x—aXis (Figure 14). For the channel
With l = 2, the plot of the free surface contour k is symmetrical With respect to the Channel center
(Figure 14(a)). For the channel With l = 18, the contour is non—symmetrical (Figure 14(b)) and
the minimum contour point is shifted towards the Channel outlet. In both cases, the ﬂow veloc—
ity 0 reaches its maximum value at the Channel throat (minimum contour point), Where the ﬂow
cross—section area A reaches its minimum. In both cases, the mean curvature h increases between
x = 0 and x = x* due to the pressure decrease (consequence of the convective ﬂow acceleration).
For the Channel With l = 2, the curvature h has almost the same value at the Channel inlet and outlet.
The pressure is almost fully recovered between x = x* and x = 1. For the Channel With l = 16, the
curvature h reaches higher a value at the Channel eXit than at the Channel entrance.

In the following, the contributions of the individual terms of the momentum equation are inves—
tigated. In Eq. (2), the reversible pressure loss due to the convective acceleration is represented
With the convective term. The irreversible frictional pressure loss is described With the Viscous term.
The observation was made that the relative proportion of both terms differs depending on the ﬂow

Where the terms from left to right represent the convective, curvature, and Viscous contributions,
respectively. Results of the 1D simulations are used to determine the magnitude of said terms,
Which are then plotted along the Channel x—aXis (Figure 15). The term H (curvature) reﬂects the
pressure evolution along the Channel and reaches higher values at the Channel outlet than at the
channel inlet. In general, with increasing Channel length, the Viscous effects become more signif—
icant. The irreversible frictional pressure loss causes the curvature difference between the Channel
outlet and inlet. The term X (representing the convective term) is a function of the local ﬂow
velocity. It reaches maximum values at the point of the minimum cross—section (Where the ﬂow
velocity reaches maximum value). The term ‘1’ (Viscous term) increases linearly along the channel
and reaches the highest value at the Channel outlet. For sufﬁciently short Channels (Figure 15(a)),
the X term dominates over ‘1’ along the entire Channel. Conversely, for sufﬁciently long channels
(Figure 15(d)), the term ‘1’ is dominant.

A Characteristic point is x+, Where convective and Viscous terms are equal in size (X = ‘1’).
The location of x+ is a function of the Channel length (Figure 16, left ordinate aXis) and can be
used to Characterize the transition between different ﬂow regimes. For ﬂow lengths l~ < 4 X 10—4, x+
is located in the vicinity of the channel outlet (x+ —> 1), and for ﬂow lengths l~ > 3 X 10‘2 in the
vicinity of the channel inlet (x+ —> 0). With increasing ﬂow length, x+ shifts towards the Channel
inlet (x = 0). A sudden drop of the curve x+ occurs at l~ = 4.5 X 10—3. The transition between the
convective and Viscous dominated ﬂow domains begins here.

It must be noted that, in the case of the convective dominated ﬂow, both ﬂow effects (convec—
tive and Viscous) eXist and inﬂuence the free surface curvature. The same applies for the Viscous
dominated ﬂows. The terms ”Viscous” and ”convective” dominated imply the dominance of the
particular term. For a further Classiﬁcation of the physical ﬂow regimes, the curvature difference be—
tween the Channel outlet and inlet Ah 2 h(x = 1) — h(x = 0) is inspected. The reversible convective
momentum transport does not affect the pressure difference between inlet and outlet of the Chan—
nel. Therefore, Ah is a Clear indicator of the presence of the irreversible, frictional pressure loss.
Figure 16 (right ordinate aXis) shows Ah as a function of the dimensionless Channel length l~.
In general, with increasing channel length, the curvature difference also increases. It is worth
noting that the results for different aspect ratios A overlap. For sufﬁciently short Channels l~ g
3 X 10—4, the curvature difference tends towards zero (n0 Viscous pressure loss). For Channel lengths

Purely Viscous 2 1.7 x 10-1 Ah > 0.99
l~ 2 1.7 X 10—1, the curvature difference tends towards unity (convective effects can be assumed
negligible). Therefore, for lengths l~ 2 1.7 X 10—1, the ﬂow is classiﬁed to be in the purely Viscous
regime (criterion is Ah > 0.99). The curvature difference Ah is equivalent to the net pressure loss in
the Channel. If the system pressure K0 is greater than zero, then Ah —> (1 — K0) in the purely Viscous
regime (solid line in Figure 16).

Finally, the purely convective ﬂow domain can be identiﬁed for sufﬁciently short Channels.
The criteria are the curvature difference (Ah < 0.05) and the free surface deformation. Besides the
curvature difference between the Channel outlet and inlet, the free surface deformation also indicates
the presence of the irreversible pressure loss. Evaluations of the CCF experiment results and the
numerical study show that for short Channels 1 < 4.8 (1D model) the minimum contour point is
located almost in the center of the Channel (x* = 0.5 i 0.012), as displayed in Figure 9. It can also
be seen in Figure 9 that the length l = 4.8 (1D) is a Characteristic length Where k* reaches its min—
imum value. Free surface proﬁles are symmetrical for l < 4.8. Increasing the Channel length above
I = 4.8 leads to the proﬁle deformation due to the irreversible frictional pressure loss. The inﬂuence
of the Viscous term is negligible for ﬂow lengths l~ < 10‘3 (symmetrical free surface contours).
Therefore, ﬂow lengths l~ < 10‘3 are classiﬁed to be in the purely convective regime. A summary of
the identiﬁed ﬂow domains is shown in Table III.

The non—dimensional channel length l~ is a function of the two non—dimensional numbers, the
Ohnesorge number Oh, and the length aspect ratio F (see Eq. (1)). Such a scaling corresponds to the
common scaling for Viscous ﬂow in ducts. As shown before, l~ can be used to Characterize the phys—
ical ﬂow regimes for the capillary Channel ﬂow. For suﬂiciently small l~, the frictional pressure loss
can be neglected and the behavior of the free surface is essentially affected by the convective term.
With increasing Z, the dominance of the convective term reduces and Viscous effects become more
signiﬁcant. For channel lengths l~ 2 4.5 X 10'3 (transition regime), the contribution of the Viscous
momentum transport is at least equal to the convective contribution (or greater). For suﬂiciently
large l~, the curvature (pressure) gradient is only related to the irreversible frictional pressure loss.

For ﬂow lengths l~ < 1.7 X 10—1, no analytical solution eXists and numerical methods are used in
order to predict the value of the critical ﬂow rate and the shape of the free surface contour. Char—
acteristic results for two representative ﬂow lengths l~ = 1.13 X 10‘3 (left boundary, pure convective
ﬂow) and l~ = 2.82 X 10'1 (right boundary, pure Viscous ﬂow) are given in Table IV. Presented
values are valid for the following parameters: A = 5, Oh = 2.26 X 10—3, K0 2 0.

VI. CONCLUSIONS

A forced ﬂow through a partially open capillary Channel was investigated experimentally and
numerically. The CCF experiment was performed under microgravity conditions on board the 188.
None of the previous experiments enabled such a broad study where different parameters were
varied in order to verify the stability theory known from literature. It was shown that the 1D model
predicts the values of the critical ﬂow rate well for the wide range of Channel lengths. The evalua—
tion of the last stable free surface contours (critical ﬂow rate) also underlines the good agreement
between the experiment and 1D simulations. It was found that the position of the minimum contour
point is a function of the Channel length. With increasing Channel length, the minimum contour
point ﬁrst shifts into the Channel and then towards the Channel eXit. This behaVior is related to the
different physical regimes Characterizing the capillary ﬂow.

After the veriﬁcation of the mathematical model, the numerical tool was employed for the
further investigation of the general behaVior of gas—liquid interfaces in open capillary Channels.
It was shown that the shape of the free surface is inﬂuenced by the ﬂow conditions, geometric
constraints, and the system pressure. The ﬂow between parallel plates was solved as a static and as a
dynamic problem.

In the zero ﬂow case, the free surface possesses a constant mean curvature dependent on
the boundary conditions (system pressure). It was shown that the maximum curvature of the free
surface is a geometric property. For sufﬁciently long Channels, the middle part of the proﬁle was
identiﬁed where only the ﬁrst principal radius contributes to the curvature (the free surface is sup—
ported by only one radius). It was demonstrated that the maximum curvature resulting in the pinned
free surface is a purely geometric quantity.

The dynamic solution was calculated for subcritical and critical (main focus of the CCF experi—
ment) ﬂow conditions. Two scenarios were considered (i) ﬂow rate variation and (ii) Channel length
variation. The different behaVior of free surfaces in “short” and “long” Channels was addressed. It
was found that the deformation of the free surface and its curvature is inﬂuenced by ﬂow conditions
(in addition to geometric constraints).

Furthermore, two major ﬂow effects, i.e., convective acceleration and Viscous pressure loss, and
their inﬂuence on the shape of the interface were investigated. It was shown that for suﬂiciently
short Channels convective effects are dominant, whereas for sufﬁciently long Channels the frictional
pressure loss dominates. Irreversible pressure loss leads to the interface deformation and the shift
of the minimum contour point towards the Channel eXit. Different physical ﬂow regimes (purely
convective, convective dominated, transition regime, Viscous dominated, and purely Viscous) were
identiﬁed in relation to the dimensionless ﬂow length.

Finally, it was proven that the mathematical model is valid and applicable for a wider range of
geometric conﬁgurations (different aspect ratios) and model parameters.
