Abstract A space materials exposure experiment was conducted on the exterior
of the International Space Station (188) using the Micro—Partieles Capturer and
Space Environment Exposure Device (MPAC&SEED) 0f the Japan Aerospace
Exploration Agency (JAXA). The MPAC&SEED experiments were aboard both
the Russian Service Module (SM/MPAC&SEED) and the exposed Facility 0f the
J apanese Experiment Module, KIBO Exposed Facility (J EM/MPAC&SEED). The
JEM/MPAC&SEED was attached to the Space Environment Data Acquisition
Equipment—Attached Payload (SEDA—AP).

The MPAC&SEED experiment included samples to monitor the ﬂuence of
AO, UV, the total dose of space radiation and the maximum temperature. In this
paper, the results of the analyses of the space environment effects on the JEM/
MPAC&SEED monitoring samples are described.

1 Introduction

The effects of the space environment on materials are very severe and complex and
depend upon the orbit in which the spacecraft is placed. In particular, in the orbit in
which the International Space Station (188) is Operated, interaction with both high—
energy particles in space and the dominant neutral gas, atomic oxygen (A0), causes
performance problems. Space debris, comprising man—made Objects in orbit around
the Earth that no longer serve any useful purpose, are also a hazard causing concern.
Spacecraft surfaces are exposed to the full strength of solar UV radiation.

In addition, the surface degradation associated with contamination can adversely
affect Optical performance. The space environment and data on its effects are thus
crucial for spacecraft design. In a space materials exposure experiment, the
materials are exposed in space, retrieved back to Earth and analyzed. The informa—
tion from the ﬂight samples provides an understanding of the actual space environ—
ment effects on materials. During its 5 years and 9 months in Low Earth Orbit
(LEO), NASA’s Long Duration Exposure Facility (LDEF) provided information on
the mierometeoroid 0r orbital debris environment based on the impacts on its
samples [1]. The Material International Space Station Experiment (MISSE) series
has been examined and exposed on the exterior of the ISS [1]. ESA’s Materials
Exposure and Degradation Experiment (MEDET) 0n the ISS has been implemented
[1]. The National Space Development Agency of J apan (NASDA), the forerunner
of JAXA, implemented the space materials exposure experiment on the STS—85/
Evaluation Of Space Environment and Effects 011 Materials (ESEM) mission in
1997, and on the Exposed Facility Flyer Unit (EFFU) 0f the Space Flyer Unit (SFU)
in 1996 [1, 2].

The MierO—Partieles Capturer (MPAC) and Space Environment Exposure
Device (SEED) are the Japanese space materials exposure experiments on the
ISS. MPAC is a mierometeoroid capture experiment, while SEED is a passive
experiment designed to eXpose materials. There are two MPAC and SEED projects.
One is for the J apanese Experiment Module Exposed Facility (J EM/EF) 0n the ISS,
and the other is for the Service Module (SM) 011 the ISS [1—3]. The MPAC and
SEED 0n the JEM/EF (hereafter JEM/MPAC&SEED) are one Of the sets of
instruments comprising the Space Environment Data Acquisition equipment —
Attached Payload (SEDA—AP) [4]. A JEM/MPAC&SEED experiment was
launched on the Space Shuttle ﬂight 127 (2J/A mission) on 15 July, 2009 and was
exposed to the space environment attached to the Space Environment Data Aequi—
siti0n Equipment—Attached Payload (SEDA—AP), which is on the KIBO Exposed
Facility (EF) and mounted on the Experiment Logistics Module—EXposed
Section (ELM—ES). SEDA—AP with JEM/MPAC&SEED was transferred to the
EFU#9 of EF on 23 July, 2009, whereupon exposure to space commenced.
SEDA—AP consists of seven sensors that measure neutrons, plasma, heavy ions,
high—energy light particles, atomic oxygen, cosmic dust, and their effects. The
orbital position of SEDA—AP 0n the ISS and JEM/MPAC&SEED is shown in
Fig. 1.

On 9 April, 2010, the JEM/MPAC&SEED samples were retrieved by extrave—
hieular activity (EVA) and intra—vehicular activity (IVA) after 259 days (8.5 months)
of in—Orbit exposure. JEM/MPAC&SEED samples arrived on the ground in the
Kennedy Space Center (KSC) 0n the Space Shuttle ﬂight 131 (19A mission) and
were moved to J apan. A primary check was performed in KSC, before transport
to J apan.

A front View of the JEM/MPAC&SEED hardware is shown in Fig. 2. The
MPAC has two functions; capturing space debris and mierometeoroids of
0001—01 mm in diameter and measuring their ﬂuX in orbit. Siliea—aerogel is

damage, while gold plate is used for MPAC 011 Sample Unit 2 to investigate the
ﬂux of impacts on the same. The SEED has holders to expose nine material samples
(25.4 mm (1 in.) dia. and 32.3 mm (1.27 in.) dia.) and space environment monitoring
samples 011 Sample Units 2 and 3. A material list of SEED samples, including space
environment monitoring samples, is shown in Table 1. The black paint and Theme
Label were not exposed to space.

The JEM/MPAC&SEED was a passive experiment that used neither a power
source nor communication; hence no in-situ information was telemetered from
space. Samples to monitor AO, UV ﬂuence, total dose of space radiation, and
temperature were situated on board as “space environment monitoring samples”.
In this study, the results of analyses of the effects of space on the space environment
monitoring samples have been investigated.

2 Space Environment Monitoring Samples
2.1 U V F luence Monitoring
For our UV ﬂuenee monitoring, we used a DUSoOl (Urethane Sheet) covered with
ITO to protect against AO erosion. The same type of sample was also used in the
past mission (SM/MPAC&SEED) [5]. Solar—absorption (ocs) data, along with the
calibration data were acquired in the Xe—resonance lamp—irradiation test to evaluate
the UV ﬂuenee. We arranged the samples on gel sheets in a vacuum Chamber to
prevent increased temperature because of the Xe lamp that contains an infrared
wavelength region. Two polyurethane sheets are attached.
2.2 Space-Radiation Effect: T otal Ionizing Dose ( T ID)
We used three types of dosimeters to evaluate the effect of space radiation: Thermo—
Lumineseent Dosimeter (TLD), alanine dosimeter, and Radiation—Sensitive Field—
Effeet Transistor (RADFET). The same types of samples were also used in the past
mission (SM/MPAC&SEED) [5]. The TLD was also used on the ESEM mission 1.
A TLD is a small device that is used to evaluate radiation eXposure by measuring
the amount of Visible light emitted by a crystal when heated in the detector. The
amount of emitted light depends on the ionizing irradiation exposure. We arranged
siX TLDs behind a 4.5 —mm—thiek aluminum shield on both the ram and wake sides
of a sample tray.

An alanine dosimeter is a solid device consisting mainly of alanine and polysty—
rene, the radical density of which increases in proportion to the dose of radiation
received. The relative density of the radical is measured using Electron Spin
Resonance (ESR). Two alanine dosimeters were arranged behind a 0.15—mm
aluminum shield with silver coated FEP on a sample tray.

A RADFET is a specially designed P—Channel metal oxide semiconductor
(PMOS) transistor with a thick gate oxide, which is optimized for increased
radiation sensitiVity [6, 7]. The RADFET is suitable for real—time space dosimetry
missions in terms of cost, weight, and low power consumption variables. The
RADFETs used in MPAC&SEED were 400 nm implanted gate—oxide devices,
manufactured by the Tyndall National Institute of Ireland. We arranged two
RADFETs on a sample tray. This RADFET had a 0.8—mm—thiek equivalent
aluminum lid.
3 A0 Monitoring
Vespel (SP—l) was selected for A0 monitoring. Vespel is made from aromatic
polyirnide powder. Kapton—lOOH was selected as the AO monitoring sample on the
ESEM mission 1. Vespel (t = 500 pm) is thicker than Kapton—lOOH (t = 25 um).
If we were to extend the eXposure period of MPAC&SEED on the JEM mission, the
AO would completely erode the Kapton—lOOH; therefore, we selected Vespel due to
its larger thickness [6]. Ground AO irradiation testing was conducted to calibrate
the atorniC—oxygen ﬂuenee. We conducted irradiation tests at JAXA’s Combined
Space Effects Test Facility, which is equipped with PSI’s FAST AO source, a
deuterium UV—ray source, and an electron—beam source [8].

Figure 3 illustrates the dependence of mass loss from Vespel and its depen—
dence on the AO ﬂuenee. The efﬁciency of mass losses on the linear part is equal
to Re : 2.92 x 10—24[Cm3/atoms]. Using this relationship between A0 ﬂuenee
and mass loss, AO ﬂuenee acting on the test specimen in orbit is derived as
follows.

A0Fluence[at0ms/cm2] : A—W (1)
Re 0 p o A

In that equation, density p. [2 1.43 g/Cm3], exposed surface A [2 3.14 emz] and
AW is mass loss [g].

The effect of UV on Vespel that is an A0 monitoring sample was also veriﬁed in
a series of experiments. In the ﬁrst series, the samples were AO irradiated at
3 x 1021[atorns/Cm2], followed by UV irradiation at 100 [ESD]. In the second
series, the samples were UV irradiated at 100 [ESD] followed by A0 irradiation at
3 x 1021 [atoms/sz]. Figure 4 shows both irradiation test results with the data
from Fig. 3 also added. As can be seen from Fig. 4, the Re was not affected by the
ultraviolet rays.

The orbital and altitude ﬂight information of the ISS during this experiment
period was analyzed. The average ﬂight altitude was 343 km; the inclination was
51.60. We compared ﬂight data and data from the space—enVironment model for the
UV, TID and A0 in the Space Environment and Effects System (SEES) [9] from
23 J uly, 2009 to 9 April, 2010. We used the F107 and Ap indeX data available from
NOAA Space Weather Data and Products [10] for neutral gas estimation and
considered the ﬂight—direction Change, shape of the ISS structure and shadow of
the Earth in our calculations.

As for UV ﬂuenee, the monitoring sample output was 1/2 the model output when
UV ﬂuenee was 30 [ESD]. The UV ﬂuence of JEM/MPAC&SEED was 1.7 times
greater than that Of SM/MPAC&SEED#1. The reason for discrepancy between the
JEM/MPAC&SEED and model was the uncertainty of the UV model in SEES,
while the reasons for the low numbers of SM/MPAC&SEED#1 UV ﬂuenee com—
pared to JEM/MPAC&SEED were the View factors from SM/MPAC&SEED and
the contamination effect [4].

TID from models is overestimated except for shield thickness equal to 4.5 mm.
One Of the reasons for discrepancies between the ﬂight data and model calculation
is the difference of electron and proton ﬂuxes within a certain energy range [11, 12].
Renewal of space radiation models and continuous monitoring is required.

AO ﬂuenee, which is derived from the AO monitoring sample, is 40 % less than the
model output, while the AO ﬂuence of J EM/MPAC&SEED is three times greater than
SM/MPAC&SEED#1. The reason for discrepancy between J EM/MPAC&SEED and
the model is also the uncertainty of the AO (neutral gas) model in SEES. In addition,
the reasons for the low numbers of SM/MPAC&SEED#1 AO ﬂuenee compared to
JEM/MPAC&SEED are the View factors from SM/MPAC&SEED and the contami—
nation effect [5]. The exposure period Of SM/MPAC&SEED#1 from 2001 to 2002
coincided with the solar maximum and the solar activity was so high that it could

"

affect AO (neutral gas) ﬂuence for model calculation. Moreover, the AO monitoring
sample of JEM/MPAC&SEED may also have been affected by contamination.
The effects of these derived space environment factors must be veriﬁed from the
perspectives of SEED sample analysis and their ground evaluation tests.
Moreover, it is necessary to measure and analyze the space environment and data
on its effects continuously and in the long term to establish more reliable
conclusions. In this mission, SEDA—AP had an active space environment monitor
space radiation (Standard Dose monitor: DOM) and A0 ﬂuenee (Atomic Oxygen
Monitor : AOM)[12]. Namely, both passive and active space radiation and A0
ﬂuenee data were acquired during JEM/MPAC&SEED exposure to space [13, 14].
This space environment measurement sensor data onboard SEDA—AP will be used
for this analysis in future.
5 Conclusions
8.5 months spaee—eXposed JEM/MPAC&SEED were retrieved successfully and all
samples were analyzed. Using the space environment monitoring samples, UV
ﬂuence, total ionized dose i.e. TID and A0 ﬂuenee information data were acquired.
The space environment data Obtained in this experiment, the modeling data and the
data from previous SM/MPAC&SEED#1 were compared. The space environment
and data on its effects must be continuously measured and analyzed on a more long—
term basis in order to establish more reliable conclusions. This space environment
measurement sensor data onboard SEDA—AP will be used for this analysis in future.
