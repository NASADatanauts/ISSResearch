Abstract
A new culture-independent system for microbial monitoring, called the Lab-On—a-Chip Application Develop-
ment Portable Test System (LOCAD-PTS), was Operated aboard the International Space Station (188). LOCAD-
PTS was launched to the ISS aboard Space Shuttle STS-116 on December 9, 2006, and has since been used by 188
crews to monitor endotoxin 0n cabin surfaces. Quantitative analysis was performed within 15 minutes, and
sample return to Earth was not required. Endotoxin (a marker of Gram-negative bacteria and fungi) was
distributed throughout the ISS, despite previous indications that most bacteria on 188 surfaces were Gram-
positive. Endotoxin was detected at 24 out of 42 surface areas tested and at every surface site where colony-
forming units (cfu) were Observed, even at levels of 4—120 bacterial Cfu per 100 cm2, which is below NASA
in-ﬂight requirements (< 10,000 bacterial cfu per 100 cmz). Absent to low levels of endotoxin (<0.24 to 1.0 EU per
100 cm2; defined in endotoxin units, or EU) were found on 31 surface areas, including on most panels in Node 1
and the US Lab. High to moderate levels (1.01 to 14.7 EU per 100 cm2) were found on 11 surface areas, including
at exercise, hygiene, sleeping, and dining facilities. Endotoxin was absent from airlock surfaces, except the
Extravehicular Hatch Handle (>378 EU per 100 cmz). Based upon data collected from the 188 so far, new culture-
independent requirements (defined in EU) are suggested, which are verifiable in ﬂight with LOCAD-PTS yet
high enough to avoid false alarms. The suggested requirements are intended to supplement current 188 re-
quirements (defined in cfu) and would serve a dual purpose of safeguarding crew health (internal spacecraft
surfaces <20 EU per 100 cm2) and monitoring forward contamination during Constellation missions (surfaces
periodically exposed to the external environment, including the airlock and space suits, <0.24 EU per 100 cmz).
