Abstract Desiccated Antarctic rocks colonized by cryptoendolithic communities were
exposed on the International Space Station (188) to space and simulated Mars conditions
(LiFE—Lichens and Eungi Experiment). After 1.5 years in space samples were retrieved,
rehydrated and spread on different culture media. Colonies of a green alga and a pink—coloured
fungus developed on Malt—Agar medium; they were isolated from a sample exposed to
simulated Mars conditions beneath a 0.1 %T Suprasil neutral density ﬁlter and from a sample
exposed to space vacuum without solar radiation exposure, respectively. None of the other
ﬂight samples showed any growth after incubation. The two organisms able to grow were
identiﬁed at genus level by Small SubUnit (SSU) and Internal Transcribed Spacer (ITS) rDNA
sequencing as Stichococcus sp. (green alga) and Acarospora sp. (lichenized fungal genus)
respectively. The data in the present study provide experimental information on the possibility
of eukaryotic life transfer from one planet to another by means of rocks and of survival in Mars
environment.

Introduction

The Lithopanspermia hypothesis suggests that impact—ejected rocks could transfer living
organisms through space from one planet to another (Horneck et a1. 2010). This scenario
implies that rock-embedded organisms need to survive (i) the ejection into space within rock
fragments, (ii) the journey through space for a long time (hundreds up to thousands or
millions of years) and (iii) the landing on another p1anet(G1adman et a1. 1996; Mileikowsky
et a1. 2000; Horneck et a1. 2008; Nicholson 2009).

Despite an ever—eXpanding understanding of the limits of life in the Earth’s most extreme
environments, 1itt1e remains known about life’s potential to survive when removed from
Earth and the a11-encompassing biosphere that harbors it. Scientiﬁc literature has numerous
reports on microbial survival and proliferation in the most inhospitable environments that
our planet has to offer (Rothschild and Mancinelli 2001; Venkateswaran et a1. 2001;
Canganella and Wiegel 2011). All the while, reports addressing the uppermost limits of
microbial survival in near-Earth orbit (Horneck et a1. 2010), in the interplanetary (Mileikowsky
et a1. 2000) or interste11ar space are scarce (Valtonen et a1. 2009). Early studies of long-term
survival in outer space have dealt with prokaryotes, mostly bacterial endospores (e.g., Horneck
et a1. 1994). Later on, studies were extended to eukaryotes exposed to either simulated space
conditions or space during short-term ﬂights, such as the experiments in the framework of
ESA’s Biopan missions (Sancho et a1. 2007; de la Torre et a1. 2010; Raggio et a1. 2011). The
lichens Rhizocarpon geographicum, Xanthoria elegans and Aspiciliafmticulosa were exposed
to space environment for about 10 days; long term experiments in space on eukaryotic test
organisms have been done for the ﬁrst time within this LIFE experiment. To ascertain the
uppermost extreme limits of life, it is important to start examining a wider spectrum of
microbiota, including those rock—embedded communities from extreme environments such as
Antarctic deserts, and expose them to space in their integrity, i.e. in their natural substrate.

Cryptoendolithic communities are among the most resistant life forms ever encountered,
originally discovered in the extremely cold, hyper—arid Dry Valleys of Antarctica (Friedmann
1982). In structural cavities of Antarctic sandstones lichenized and non-lichenized fungi and
algae (cryptoendoliths), bacteria, cyanobacteria, form the lichen-dominated cryptoendolithic
community (Friedmann 1982). Their extreme environment is considered the most similar
terrestrial environment to Mars surface (Wynn-Williams and Edwards 2000; Onofri et a1.
2004); it is characterized by very low temperatures, ranging from —20 to —50 0C in winter,
with annual average temperature below 0 0C, wide thermal ﬂuctuations, frequent freeze/
thaw cycles, dryness due to the lack of snow or ice cover and rare precipitations (<100 mm
water equivalent per year), high salt concentrations, low nutrient availability and high
radiation including UV (Onofri et a1. 2007). Molecular studies of environmental DNA
extracts from these communities suggested the identity of an endolithic fungal phylotype
with adjacent epilithically growing Buellia spp. (>97 % similarity of SSU rDNA sequences;
de la Torre et a1. 2003). The same authors highlighted the microbial biodiversity in these
communities comprising lichen mycobionts, free-liVing fungi, algae, as well as Actino-
bacteria, Alphaproteobacteria, Gammaproteobacteria and some other unidentiﬁed bacterial
phylotypes. Some new genera and species of black meristematic fungi have also been
described, but most taxa have not been formally described (Selbmann et a1. 2005; Selbmann
et a1. 2008). The increasing knowledge about diverse eukaryotes thriving in such harsh

conditions suggested to test the survival of a whole rock community in a space ﬂight
experiment under space and simulated Martian conditions.

In this LIFE experiment, fragments of sandstone colonized by cryptoendolithic commu-
nities from the McMurdo Dry Valleys (Antarctica) were ﬂown in the European EXPOSE-E
facility attached to the exterior of the ISS. Their suitability was tested before ﬂight in
ground-based Experiment Veriﬁcation Tests (Onofri et al. 2009). The samples were exposed
for 18 months to the environment of space in Low Earth Orbit (LEO) and to simulated Mars
conditions. Once returned to Earth they were subjected to both, molecular and cultivation-
based assays to estimate survival and Viability (Onofri et al. 2012) including growth ability.
Materials and Methods
Colonized Sandstone
A sample of colonized porous sandstone 0f the Beacon Supergroup was collected by L.
Zucconi at Battleship Promontory (76054’37.6""S 160055’27.5""E), Southern Victoria Land,
Antarctica in January 2004; it was stored under sterile conditions at —20 oC. The samples
were individually inspected under the stereornicroscope along the lengthwise section of the
substrate, where they presented the typical colored bands, indicating the presence of active
and living lichen dominated microbial cryptoendolithic community (Friedmann 1982; Nienow
and Friedmann 1993; Friedmann and Weed 1987). Well colonized sandstone fragments (11 mm
wide, maximum 6 mm thick, on average 437 mg) including remarkable portions of microbial
biomass were removed under sterile conditions by striking the sandstone sample lengthwise
with a rock hammer. Excised fragments were dehydrated at room temperature and glued, using
Wacker silicone glue RTV—S 69, on sterile teﬂon disks (12 mm diameter). These fragments were
successively accommodated in different trays of the EXPOSE-E facility.

EXPOSE-E Facility

The European Space Agency (ESA) has recently developed the multi-user research facility
EXPOSE-E as an exterior partition of the ISS (Rabbow et al. 2009) (Fig. 1). This facility is
designed to foster and promote astrobiology research including studies on the survival of,
and genotypic and phenotypic changes in, model organisms (plant seeds, bacterial spores,
black meristematic fungi, lichens, and cryptoendolithic communities) when exposed to the
outer space environment.

The EXPOSE-E facility is a multi-user facility having a bOX-shaped structure, accom-
modating samples in three different and separate compartments, called trays (Fig. 1). Each
tray is subdivided in four sample carriers composed of 16 wells disposed on two levels, to
face either outward towards space and radiations 0r kept beneath at the same conditions but
in the darkness. The LIFE samples were exposed either in Tray 1 that was vented with access
to space vacuum or in Tray 2 that was sealed and ﬁlled with a simulated Mars gas mixture.
The carriers were covered by an optical ﬁlter system to control intensity and spectral range
of solar UV irradiation. The conditions to which the Antarctic sandstone fragments were
exposed are listed in Table 1. During the 1.5 year lasting mission the rock samples
experienced space vacuum (10—7 to 10—4 Pa) (Horneck et al. 2010), cosmic radiation
(£190 mGy) (Berger et al. 2012) and the full spectrum of solar extraterrestrial electromagnetic
radiation (for space exposed samples with a long pass cut—off at 110 nm, and for simulated Mars
condition samples with a long pass cut off at 200 nm). The UV (200—400 nm) ﬂuences reached

range of 200 nm <A> 400 nm for the whole mission and depended on the orientation of the 188
to the sun. Temperature varied between —21.5 0C and +59.6 oC (Rabbow et al. 2012;
Onofri et al. 2012).
Cultivability Tests
Treated samples (only one third of the whole sample analyzed, meanly 140 mg), ground
controls (mean weight 91,2 mg) and fresh colonized rocks (weight about 500 mg) were
gently homogenized in sterile physiological solution (0.9 % NaCl w/V) and plated 011 MA
(Malt Agar, incubated at 15 0C for 3 months. The MA medium was selected because it gave
best growth for colonies from fresh colonized rock samples. Each test was performed in
triplicate.
The organisms that were able to grow were isolated and stored in pure culture at 10 0C.

DNA Extraction and Sequencing

DNA was extracted from colonies grown for 6 months at 10 0C, using Nucleospin Plant Kit
(Macherey Nagel, Diiren, Germany) according to the user’s manual. Polymerase Chain
Reactions (PCR) were prepared in PCR tubes adding 12.5 pl of 2>< BioMiX (catalog 110.
25011, BioLine GmbH, Luckenwalde, Germany), 5 [1M of each primer (1 141 each), 40 11g of
template (1 pl), to a ﬁnal volume of 25 141 by adding nuclease free water (9.5 141). Internal
Transcribed Spacers (ITS) were ampliﬁed using ITSl and ITS4 primers (Table 2) for fungi
with the following PCR protocol: an initial denaturation step at 95 0C for 2 min, followed by
35 cycles of denaturation at 95 0C for 30 s, annealing at 55 0C for 30 s, and an extension at
72 0C for 30 s. At the end of the last cycle, an additional extension at 72 0C for 5 min was
performed. The algal Internal Transcribed Spacer was ampliﬁed using ITSlT and ITS4T
primers (Table 2) with the following protocol: initial denaturation at 94 0C for 2 min, 30
cycles of denaturation at 94 0C for 1 min, annealing at 50 0C for 1 min, and an extension at
72 0C for 2 min; an additional extension at 72 0C for 7 min was performed. Algal SSU was
ampliﬁed with a PCR spanning the whole rRNA Small Subunit region using primers Euk A
and Euk B (Table 2) with the following protocol: an initial denaturation at 94 0C for 3 min,
30 cycles of denaturation at 94 0C for 45 s, annealing at 55 0C for 1 min, and extension at
72 0C for 3 min, and a ﬁnal extension at 72 0C for 5 min. The DNA sequences were assessed
by direct sequencing of the PCR product (Macrogen, South Korea).

Sequence assembling was performed by using the software ChromasPro V1.41 (2003—2007
Conor McCarthy School of Health Science, Grifﬁth University, Southport, Queensland,
Australia). Sequences were compared in the public domain (NCBI) using BLASTn algorithm.
Results
The ﬁrst test in the LIFE experiment was to observe the effects of dehydration. The growth
ability of the ﬂight samples, i.e. Antarctic sandstones hosting cryptoendolithic communities
that were exposed to different conditions in space was compared to that of the dehydrated
Ground Control (GC) and a fresh sample of sandstone stored at —20 0C. Table 3 shows the
colonies formed after cultivation 011 MA. The highest colony numbers were obtained from
the fresh samples: 52¢ 10.5 algae, 1i0 black fungi, 90i27 pink fungi and 12.6i2.0 yeasts.

The GC sample, which was stored for 1.5 years in the laboratory, showed only 20.56i3.5
colonies of pink fungi.

Three fungal colony with a pale pink mycelium (Fig. 2) composed of appressed hyphae
0f 4 pm in width were obtained from a ﬂight sample that was exposed to space vacuum, but
kept in the dark (Table 3: Space Dark).

One colony of a green unicellular alga (Fig. 3) grew from a ﬂight sample that was
exposed to simulated Mars atmosphere and the Martian spectrum of solar radiation >200 nm
beneath a suprasil neutral density ﬁlter (Table 3: Mars 0.1 % insolated). All other ﬂight
samples did not result in any colonies after incubation (Table 3).

Macroscopic observations and microscopic morphological analyses showed that both, the
pink fungus from the Space Dark sample as well as the green unicellular alga from the Mars
0.1 % insolated sample have features identical to the same microorganisms isolated from the
fresh and the GC samples. In order to get a better understanding on which genera or species
belong to the two survivors in Space and Mars condition, additional molecular investigation
has been performed.

The sequences obtained through PCR ampliﬁcation and sequencing of ITS rDNA
portions, gave low identity (94 %), with E-Value=0, in NCBI GenBank with the lichenized
genus Acamspom A. Massal. The closest related sequence was that ofAcarospora rosulata
(accession number GU184116.1). Based on this data the fungus was identiﬁed at the genus
level only.

To further identify the green alga, the same analyses (PCR ampliﬁcation of ITS rDNA
portions and sequencing) showed that the ITS sequences matched with different algal genera
with similarities ranging from 95 % to 97 %, E-Value=0. They belonged to the Class
Trebouxiophyceae, 5 of them showing similarities to the Order Chlorellales, and 1, the
genus Stichococcus, that is nested within a moderately supported cluster comprising the
weakly supported order Prasiolales, (97 % identity) (N eustupa et al. 2007). SSU sequencing
showed a similarity ranging from 94 % to 96 %, E-Value=0, with different algal species in
the genus Stichococcus, the closest related sequence (96 %) was S. deasonii UTEX 1706
(accession number DQ275460). This strain grew mostly as single cells or four-celled short
uniseriate and unbranched, straight or sigmoid, ﬁlaments. However, the morphology of the

Low Earth Orbit. After exposure to the conditions applied during the LIFE experiment in
outer space, a few cryptoendolithic organisms grew after recovery, namely in one Space
Dark sample (3 fungal colonies) and in one Mars 0.1 % insolated sample (1 green algal
colony). The pink lichenized fungus seemed to belong to the genus Acamspom and the
green alga seemed to belong to the genus Stichococcus. Due to the scarcity of algal ITS and
SSU sequences in nucleotide databases, it was only possible to address the alga to genus
level. Considering the generic level of the data obtained, an extended study based on
morphology and multi-gene molecular phylogeny is in progress.

All other ﬂight samples did not result in any growth under the conditions tested. Isolation
in culture from fresh samples produced mainly pink fungal colonies, and green algae,
besides few yeasts and black fungi. From GC only a lower number of pink fungal colonies
have been obtained. 1.5 years of desiccation of GC samples justify the decrease of CFUs
observed, as well as the absence of yeasts, black fungi and green algae (Table 3). It is
interesting to note that although no algal growth was observed in the ground control
samples, one algal colony was isolated from the Mars 0.1 % insolated sample (Table 3).
This fact could be due to (i) prolonged desiccation in Earth atmosphere could be more
harmful than Mars condition simulated in space (ii) the green alga was absent in the GC
sample analysed, due to the not uniform distribution of the organisms composing the
community within the Antarctic sandstone fragments. Pink fungi and the green alga, isolated
from samples exposed on the exterior of 188, are micro- and macroscopically identical to the
ones obtained from fresh samples and GC, belonging to the same species living in the same
cryptoendolithic community. Besides, Acamspom and Stichococcus are known to be mem-
bers of lichen dominated cryptoendolithic microbial community, colonizing porous sand-
stone of the Beacon Supergroup (Nienow and Friedmann 1993). Antarctic cryptoendolithic
organisms have been suggested as good study model for survival in space because of their
ability to cope with the complex interplay of extremely low temperatures, thermal ﬂuctuations,
arid phases and high radiation intensities (Selbmann et al. 2005, 2011; Ruisi et al. 2007).
Moreover, it has been assumed that organisms living within rocks could enter a cryptobiotic
state after being ejected into space (Onofri et al. 2012).

This feature is possibly aided by the presence of abundant extracellular polymeric
substances (EPS) in many endolithic species. EPS production allows the community to
survive long dry periods, it may be abundant in fungi (Selbmann et al. 2005), in lichen thalli
(de Vera et al. 2004; De los Rios et al. 2005), and in the whole cryptoendolithic community
(De los Rios et al. 2004). Previous studies ascertained that the presence of sugars such as
glucose or buffer salts on the surface of Bacillus subtilis spores act as chemical protectants,
highly increasing their survival in space (Horneck et al. 1994). Furthermore Mancinelli and
Klovstad (2000) showed that under 1 mm of Martian analog soil a B. subtilis monolayer did
not exhibit loss of Viability after exposure to 12.3 kJan of UV radiation from deuterium
source, and some protection was even afforded by a layer 12 pm thick. The few rock-
colonizing organisms that were isolated after retrieval of EXPOSE-E could have been
survived because of: (i) the ability of cryptoendolithic organisms to tolerate desiccation
and radiation and (ii) the shielding of even a small layer of rock material thereby preventing
loss of Viability after simulated Martian UV irradiation. However, the study showed also that
only a few microorganisms out of the rock colonizing community survived after 1.5 years in
space or in a simulated Martian climate while most of them died. Although they are adapted
to cope with extreme dryness and cold in the Antarctic desert, they were damaged by the
much more hostile conditions of space or simulated Mars.

Nevertheless extremophilic endolithic Eukarya composing this Antarctic community may
be suitable model organisms to investigate the resistance of life in the framework of
