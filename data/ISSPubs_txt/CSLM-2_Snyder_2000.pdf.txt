Abstract—The coarsening of solid-Sn particles in a Pb—Sn liquid was studied under microgravity con-
ditions. Spatial correlation functions were measured on plane sections in a low-VOIume fraction system
undergoing Ostwald ripening. The correlation functions changed with time in a way that indicated that the
microstructure initially consisted of clusters of particles and evolved into one which was more dispersed.
The model by Akaiwa and Voorhees (AV) was used to study the effect of spatial correlations 0n the ripen-
ing process. We found that the initially highly correlated structure had no observable effect on the evol-
ution of particle size distributions, but did have an effect on the coarsening rate of the system. Speciﬁcally,
we determined that a structure consisting of clusters of particles coarsened faster than a system with a ran-
dom, spatial arrangement of non-overlapping particles. We also found that the approach of the microstruc-
ture towards the steady-state regime could be monitored more sensitively using spatial correlations rather
than using particle size distributions. The spatial correlations and the particle size distributions measured
from the experiment agreed well with those calculated from the AV simulations using the initial experimen-
tal correlations and size distribution. © 2000 Acta Metallurgica Inc. Published by Elsevier Science Ltd. All
