METHODS
Materials for crystallization. A gene encoding a ribozyme derivative of phage
Twort 0rf142—I2 was synthesized by PCR ampliﬁcation of pTHSl7 (ref. 31). The
resulting fragment encodes a T7 promoter, nucleotides 9—250 of the intron, and
an Earl site. This fragment was cloned between the XbaI and HindIII sites of
pUC19 and propagated in Escherichia coli strain XL—1 Blue. To facilitate tran—
scription and crystallization, the second nucleotide in the ribozyme, U10, was
mutated to an A, and nucleotides 100—107 were replaced with 5’—
GCGGAAACGC—3’. The Twort ribozyme was generated by runoff transcription
and puriﬁed as described7. The product analogue 5’—GCUU—3’ was purchased
from Dharmacon, and deprotected and desalted as recommended by the
manufacturer.
Crystallization and data collection. CYT— 18 protein was added to the RNA such
that the molar ratio of dimeric CYT—18/A424—669 to RNA was 1:1. Before
crystallization, the buffer was exchanged to 10 mM potassium cacodylate
pH 6.5, 15 mM MgClz, 50 mM KCl and concentrated to 100 pl with a
Centricon YM-30 centrifugal ﬁlter (Millipore). This resulted in a solution with
an A260 of 44.5 and an A280 of 23.8. Crystals were grown by using the hanging—
drop method. To make the drops, 2 pl of the Twort—CYT—18 solution were
mixed with 1 pl of well solution composed of 50 mM potassium cacodylate
pH 6.5 and 1.8M ammonium sulphate. Crystals appeared after 2 days at 4 0C
and continued to grow to maximum dimensions of 0.35 mm X 0.5 mm. The
crystals were gradually transferred into a cryostabilizing solution containing
50 mM potassium cacodylate pH 6.5, 30 mM MgClz, 2mM spermine, 2.4M
ammonium sulphate and 15% xylitol, and then ﬂash frozen in liquid nitrogen
before data collection. Data were collected at 100 K on beamline 23—ID—D at the
Advanced Photon Source, using a detector distance of 575 mm and an oscillation
angle of 0.250. Reﬂections were indexed and integrated with HKL2000 (ref. 28)
(Supplementary Table 1). The mosaic spread was reﬁned in batches of 20 frames
and ranged from 0.821 to 2.111 depending on the orientation of the crystal. Low
redundancy and completeness is due primarily to modestly anisotropic diffrac—
tion combined with highly mosaic zones of the crystal that result in poor spot
proﬁles and spot rejections. This loss is most pronounced in the highest—reso—
lution shells as a result of the greater propensity for spot overlap and weak
diffraction.
Phasing and reﬁnement. Molecular replacement was performed with Phaser29
with the dimeric CYT—18/A424—669 structure12 and Twort ribozyme structure7
as search models. Four copies of the protein dimer were located within the
asymmetric unit, followed by the four RNA molecules. Supplementary Table 2
shows log—likelihood gain and Z—score statistics after rotation and translation of
each search model. The progressive increases in log—likelihood gain and Z—scores
with the addition of each search model provide evidence for the correctness of
the molecular replacement solution. We also explored P21 as a possible space
group, but Phaser showed a decrease in log—likelihood gain and Z—scores after
placement of the second protein dimer.

The model was reﬁned with CNS30 (Supplementary Table 1). Distance
restraints were derived from the molecular replacement search models and used
to minimize the parameter—to—observation ratio32 (Supplementary Table 1).
These restraints were based on optimal hydrogen bonds as determined by
WHAT IF“. Only main—chain hydrogen bonds (NH—O) were used for the
protein, whereas all optimal hydrogen bonds were used for the RNA. Non—
crystallographic symmetry restraints were used between corresponding protein
subunits and RNA molecules. Parameters for the bulk solvent model were
determined through automated procedures in CNS. Reﬁnement consisted of
rigid—body reﬁnement after molecular replacement, one round of reﬁnement
(simulated annealing, conjugate gradient minimization and B—factor reﬁne—
ment) before any manual building, and one round of reﬁnement after building
of residues in P5a and correction of the P6a and P9.1 helices. A ﬁnal round of
minimization was performed after minor adjustments to the model. Manual
building was done with Xﬁt34.
