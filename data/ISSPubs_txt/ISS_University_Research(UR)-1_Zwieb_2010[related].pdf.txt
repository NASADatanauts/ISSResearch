Archaea SRP is composed of an SRP RNA molecule and two bound proteins named SRP19 and SRP54. Regulated by the binding
and hydrolysis of guanosine triphosphates, the RNA—bound SRP54 protein transiently associates not only with the hydrophobic
signal sequence as it emerges from the ribosomal eXit tunnel, but also interacts with the membrane—associated SRP receptor (FtsY).
Comparative analyses of the archaea genomes and their SRP component sequences, combined with structural and biochemical
data, support a prominent role of the SRP RNA in the assembly and function of the archaea SRP. The Be motif, which in eukaryotes
binds a 72 kilodalton protein, is preserved in most archaea SRP RNAs despite the lack of an archaea SRP72 homolog. The primary
function of the Be region may be to serve as a hinge, strategically positioned between the small and large SRP domain, allowing
the elongated SRP to bind simultaneously to distant ribosomal sites. SRP19, required in eukaryotes for initiating SRP assembly,
appears to play a subordinate role in the archaea SRP or may be defunct. The N—terminal A region and a novel C—terminal R region
of the archaea SRP receptor (FtsY) are strikingly diverse or absent even among the members of a taxonomic subgroup.

FIGURE 1: Hypothetical steps in the SRP—mediated targeting of archaea proteins. Step 1: A ribosome (gray, with A, P and E tRNA binding
sites) in the cytoplasm translates a mRNA molecule (black, 5’ and 3’ ends are indicated) which encodes a N—terminal signal or membrane—
anchor sequence (black dots). Step 2: As the signal emerges from the large ribosomal subunit, it is recognized by the elongated SRP and
further translation may be halted. Step 3: The SRP—bound ribosome nascent chain complex (RNC) binds to free or membrane—associated
