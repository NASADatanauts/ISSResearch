Purpose

To evaluate radiation induced chromosome aberration frequency in peripheral blood
lymphocytes of cosmonauts who participated in ﬂights on Mir Orbital Station and 188
(International Space Station).

Materials and methods

Cytogenetic examination which has been performed in the period 1992-2008 included
the analysis of chromosome aberrations using conventional Giemsa staining method in 202
blood samples from 48 cosmonauts who participated in ﬂights on Mir Orbital Station and 188.

Results

Space ﬂights led to an increase of chromosome aberration frequency. Frequency of
dicentrics plus centric rings (Dic+Rc) depend on the space ﬂight duration and accumulated dose
value. After the change of space stations (from Mir Orbital Station to 188) the radiation load of
cosmonauts based on data of cytogenetic examination decreased. Extravehicular activity also
adds to chromosome aberration frequency in cosmonauts' blood lymphocytes. Average doses
after the ﬁrst ﬂight, estimated by the frequency of Dic+Rc, were 227 and 113 mGy Eq for long-
term ﬂights (LTF) and 107 and 53 mGy Eq for short-term ﬂights (STF).

Conclusion

Cytogenetic examination of cosmonauts can be applied to assess equivalent doses.
Key words: biological dosimetry, space radiation, chromosome aberrations

"4","1. Introduction

Analysis of chromosome aberrations in peripheral blood lymphocytes of radiation
exposed persons is widely used for dose estimation. The most commonly applied method in
biological dosimetry (IAEA, 2001) is the dicentric assay, Where radiation doses are assessed by
comparing the observed dicentric frequency With a standard in vitro dose-effect curve. This
method is very suitable for biological dosimetry owing to low background of dicentrics and the
reliability of their detection. The main disadvantage of the dicentric assay is that With increasing
time after exposure a gradual decline in the frequency of cells containing unstable chromosome
aberrations (dicentrics) occurs. Therefore, dicentric assay becomes less precise for retrospective
biological dosimetry. As an alternative, scoring of stable chromosome aberrations
(translocations) should be more suitable since the frequency of cells With translocations remain
constant even for decades after exposure. Doses, as estimated by the frequency of chromosome
aberrations (dicentrics and translocations), take into account not only physical impact of
radiation on the human body but also its individual radiosensitiVity. It is therefore not surprising
that chromosome aberration methods have been applied to examine of astronauts and
cosmonauts (Testard et al., 1996; Obe et al., 1997, 1999; Fedorenko et al., 2001, 2002; Greco et
al., 2003; Durante et al., 2003, Hayata et al., 2008, Cucinotta et al., 2008, George et al., 2001a,
2010)

During ﬂights cosmonauts are exposed to space radiation a speciﬁc feature of Which is
the presence of high-energy, highly-charged particles that penetrate tissue and have a high RBE.
The radiation load on cosmonauts increases With the duration of the space ﬂight. This may be
sufﬁcient to impair the working efﬁciency of the crew, due to early health problems and, in the
longer term, to increase the risk of carcinogenesis. Thus in order to obtain an objective
assessment of the radiation hazard of space ﬂights it is necessary to monitor the accumulated
doses. To this end, cytogenetic examination of cosmonauts can contribute, as it provides
dosimetry that also takes account of the biological effectiveness of the radiations.

"5","The present work continues our investigations carried out since 1992 (Fedorenko et a1.,
2001, 2002; Durante et a1., 2003) in which we examined the frequency of chromosome
aberrations in peripheral blood lymphocytes of cosmonauts involved in ﬂights on Mir Orbital
Stations and 188.

2. Materials and methods
2.1. Subjects
Blood samples were collected during the period of 1992 - 2008. In total 202 blood samples from
48 cosmonauts and 14 samples from 14 backup crew members (participants of pre-ﬂight
training) were analyzed using conventional Giemsa staining chromosome analysis. Of these
individuals, 23 cosmonauts participated in ﬂights on Mir Orbital Station, 19 of them were
involved in 10ng—term ﬂights (LTFs) and four in short-term ﬂights (STFs). This was an
arbitrarily division based on duration of individual ﬂights being longer or shorter than three
weeks. Additionally 43 cosmonauts were performing work at 188, 21 of whom were involved in
LTFs while 22 were involved in STFs. Most cosmonauts (26) participated in several space
ﬂights. The age of cosmonauts varied from 29 to 61 years.
2.2. Physical dosimetry

Physical dosimetric control during space ﬂights was performed with personal
thermoluminescent dosimeters ID-3M and on-board operational dosimeter P-16 (Mitrikas, V.G.,
2002; Badhwar et a1., 2002; Tset1in et a1., 2005, 2006). Cytogenetic examination results were
analyzed in comparison with the data recorded by P-16 dosimeter. Data on the space ﬂights in
which examined cosmonauts participated are presented in Table 1.
2.3. Lymphocyte culture and chromosome preparation

The blood sampling was done 1 — 2 months before the ﬂight and one day after landing.
The standard technique (Moorhead et a1., 1960) and its modiﬁcations (Snigiryova et a1., 1997)
were used. The culture medium was RPMI-1640 (Gibco/Invitrogen, USA) containing 15% calf
serum (Gibco/Invitrogen, USA), 2.5% phytohemagglutinin (Gibco/Invitrogen, USA), 2 mM

4

"
"6","glutamine with antibiotics, and 10 mM 5-br0mode0xyuridine (Sigma Chemical, USA)-f0r
ensuring ﬁrst division metaphase scoring. The cultures were incubated at 370C for 48 h with 0.1
ng/ml colcemid (BioWest, France) for the ﬁnal 3 h.
2.4. Aberration analysis

For analysis of chromosome aberrations - dicentrics, centric rings, acentrics and
chromatid aberrations (acentrics associated with dicentrics and centric rings were not included in
the “acentrics”) metaphases were stained by the “ﬂuorescence plus Giemsa’ (FPG) method and
scoring was conﬁned to guaranteed ﬁrst division cells (Apelt et al., 1981). On average, 900
metaphases from each cosmonaut were scored.
2.5. Statistical methods

Cytogenetic data were statistically processed using standard software. The validity of
intergroup differences was estimated by the Student’s t—criteria. Differences were considered
signiﬁcant at the conﬁdence level p < 0.05.
3. Results and discussion

Figure 1 shows average values of chromosome aberrations in peripheral blood
lymphocytes of cosmonauts, sampled before their ﬁrst ﬂights, and a control data set obtained in
the same laboratory from inhabitants of the Moscow region, having no professional contacts with
ionizing radiation. The data of the cosmonauts were higher for all types of aberrations
(statistically signiﬁcant differences, p<0.05). Especially noteworthy is the high level of the
radiation exposure markers — dicentrics and centric rings, which exceeds by 5-fold the Moscow
control level. A contributory reason might be the extensive diagnostic radiographic examinations
given to cosmonauts during their training and pre-ﬂight period. This illustrates the need for
assessing the pre-ﬂight aberration frequencies.

The time spent by the cosmonauts in space leads to an increase of the chromosome
aberrations frequency. Table 2 shows a clear increase in Dic+Rc observed after just one ﬂight.

5

"
"7","Compared with the pre-ﬂight levels frequencies of Dic+Rc are 2 times higher for cosmonauts
after STF, for LTF (>3 weeks) the increase was about 4 times. Similar levels of Dic+Rc have
been reported by others and in our previous reports (Obe er al. 1997, 1999, Fedorenko er al.
2001, 2002, Durante er al. 2003). The 1.5 times increase of acentrics observed in the LTF
cosmonaut group can be considered as an indicator of protracted radiation.

Following the change of space stations (from Mir Orbital Station to 188), that was
occurred in 2001, the radiation load of cosmonauts decreased based on the physical dosimetry
results by approximately 2.5 times for LTFs and 3 times for STFs. Figure 2 shows the average
dose rate during space ﬂights based on the data of radiometer P—16 for cosmonauts who
participated in ﬂights on Mir Orbital Station and 188. The cytogenetic data also showed radiation
load decrease (Figure 3). The frequency of Dic+Rc for cosmonauts after their ﬁrst ﬂights on Mir
Orbital Station and 188 decreased about 1.6 times.

Extravehicular activity (EVA) of cosmonauts may be one of the additional factors
affecting chromosome aberrations levels. Cosmonauts perform extravehicular scheduled
experiments and necessary work during the ﬂight. Hence, risks of additional irradiation increase.
The effect of EVA on the frequency of Dic+Rc in cosmonauts' peripheral blood lymphocytes
are shown in Figure 4. Clearly, for cosmonauts who stayed 18 hours or longer outside the space
vehicle a statistically signiﬁcant increase of Dic+Rc frequency was observed.

The majority of cosmonauts undertook several ﬂights. Thus, it was of special interest to
follow the dynamics of changes in the frequency of chromosome aberrations. Analysis of
individual cytogenetic data demonstrated that the dynamics of changes in cells with Dic+Rc
vary. The observed variability may be caused by the peculiarities of low-dose radiation. Taking
into account experimental evidence related to the phase non-monotonic dependence of biological
effects on low-dose radiation inﬂuence (Kudryashov, 2004), this variability is quite expected,
because in this case effects of injury and stimulation alike might be observed. Cytogenetic
effects may be inﬂuenced by the individual radiosensitiVity, which is deﬁned by DNA repair

who undertook several ﬂights. The mean Dic+Rc frequency after ﬂights on Mir Orbital Stations
was signiﬁcantly elevated compared with the pre-ﬂight level. After following ﬂights on 188
Dic+Rc frequency elevated too, however, the difference was not signiﬁcant. As mentioned
above, after the change of space stations, the radiation load of the cosmonauts decreased, which
is demonstrated by a signiﬁcant decrease of Dic+Rc frequency in 1.5 times.

Table 3 shows cytogenetic results for cosmonauts after the ﬁrst short- and long-term
ﬂights and average doses, as estimated from the mean Dic+Rc frequencies. These were
determined by reference to an in vitro dose response curve (Shevchenko V., 1998; Snigiryova
G., et al. 2002):

y = 0.1 + 1.5x + 6.398,

where y is the frequency of Dic+Rc per 100 cells; and x is the irradiation dose in Gy.

This curve was produced with acute in vitro 6OCo -ray (0.102 Gy/min) irradiation of
blood specimens derived from5 persons. Overall, 55000 metaphases from Gimsa-stained slides
were analyzed.

Taking into account that during the ﬂights cosmonauts are exposed to protracted radiation
over a long time, only the linear component of the regression equation was used for the dose
estimation: y= 0.1 +1.5x. In the absence of in vitro calibration data that more closely match the
radiation quality of the space radiations received in-ﬂight biological dose estimates have been
expressed as gray equivalent (Gy Eq).

For the cosmonauts who took part in Mir Orbital Station and 188 long-term ﬂights,
average doses were 227 and 113 mGy Eq, respectively, while for STF groups, they were 107 and
53 mGy Eq.

7

"
"9","Biological dosimetry is carried out without taking into account the actual radiation
environment in space, namely, the biological effectiveness of space radiation and the dose rate.
Nevertheless, biological assessment data indicate that the inﬂuence of space radiation upon
cosmonauts is greater than is shown by physical dosimetry. For cosmonauts of STF groups, the
difference between the biological and physical doses is 17-26 fold, while for those in LTF
groups, this range is only about 3-4 fold. One explanation for this is the long-term (about 6
months) protracted radiation exposure of cosmonauts, during Which two opposite processes take
place in their circulating blood: the induction of chromosome aberrations and the elimination of
cells With unstable chromosomal aberrations (Dic+Rc). Biological dosimetry using dicentric
assay works well for acute radiation exposure When the blood sample is taken Within a few
weeks after exposure. In case of chronic or protracted exposures this method is less sensitive,
because the frequency of dicentrics decreases With time after exposure. Dose assessment after
protracted exposure to space radiation was performed using the residual frequency of dicentrics,
Which could lead to underestimation of radiation effect on cosmonauts involved in LTFs. The
possible inﬂuence of additional space factors (stress, microgravity, G-load, modiﬁed
atmosphere) on the chromosome aberration level should also be taken into account. Combined
effects of radiation and additional space factors may lead to additive and even synergistic effects.
A disproportionately high level of chromosome aberrations observed in cosmonauts after STFs
may also be caused by the feature of space radiation Which has a high RBE.

4. Conclusion

The present results of cosmonauts’ cytogenetic examination permit the following
conclusions:

- space ﬂights increase chromosome aberration frequencies in blood
lymphocytes;
8

"
"10","- frequency of Dic+Rc which are the radiation exposure markers, depends
on the space ﬂight duration, and, correspondingly, accumulated dose value;
- after the change of space stations (from Mir Orbital Station to 188) the
radiation load of the cosmonauts based on the data of cytogenetic examination decreased;
- extravehicular activity increases chromosome aberration frequency and,
consequently, irradiation risks for cosmonauts;
- average doses after the ﬁrst ﬂight, estimated by the frequency of Dic+Rc
were 227 and 113 mGy Eq (Mir Orbital Station and 188, respectively) for the LTFs
while for STFs they were 107 and 53 mGy Eq;
- cytogenetic examination of cosmonauts can be applied to assess equivalent
doses .
