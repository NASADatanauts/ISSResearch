dOI:1O.1111/plb.12062 space, we developed an algorithm where single root images were converted into binary
images using computational edge detection methods. Binary images were processed
with Fast Fourier Transformation (FFT), and histogram and entropy were used to
determine spectral distribution, such that high entropy values corresponded to roots
that deviated more strongly from linear orientation whereas low entropy values repre-
sented straight roots. We found that act2-3 roots had a statistically stronger skewing/
coiling response than wild-type roots, but such differences were not apparent on
Earth. Ultrastructural studies revealed that newly developed cell walls of space-grown
act2-3 roots were more severely disrupted compared to space-grown wild type, and
ground control wild-type and act2-3 roots. Collectively, our results provide evidence
that, like root gravity responses on Earth, endogenous directional growth patterns of
roots in microgravity are suppressed by the actin cytoskeleton. Modulation of root
growth in space by actin could be facilitated in part through its impact on cell wall
