RESULTS OF JAXA—GCF PROJECT — HIGH—QUALITY PROTEIN
CRYSTALLIZATION UNDER MICROGRAVITY FOR STRUCTURAL BIOLOGY
Abstract
J apan Aerospace Exploration Agency (J AXA) has been conducting the project for 0h—
taining high—quality protein crystals under microgravity (J AXA—GCF pro j eet) twice a year
since 2003, to contribute to the progress of structural biology using the space environment.
In the project, we achieved a signiﬁcant technical advancement, so that the success rate of

"
"2","the crystallization has become increased. Alpha—amylase, a glycoprotein derived from As—
pergillus oryzae, has been used as a technical veriﬁcation protein for crystallization under
microgravity. We Obtained crystals of alpha—amylase which were diffracted beyond 089151
at SPring—S beamline BL12B2 using polyethylene glycol (PEG) 8000 as a precipitant.
Furthermore, crystals did not form cluster—like morphology which usually occurred on the
ground experiment. The results indicated that microgravity effected 0n alpha—amylase
crystals for improving crystal quality remarkably. From our numerical analysis, Viscosity
of the crystallization solution, caused by PEG, resulted in growing highly—ordered protein
crystals for forming protein depletion zone around a crystal especially under micrograv—
ity. Based on this, we performed lysozyme crystallization experiment using NaCl as a
precipitant in which PEG 8000 was added on purpose to increase Viscosity of the crystal—
lization solution to enhance the effects of microgravity. We successfully Obtained lysozyme
crystal which was diffracted 088151 at SPring—8 beamline BL12B2. The 08915; and 0.88151
resolution are among the highest resolution data in the Protein Data Bank to date. We
concluded that we have developed technologies for growing high—quality protein crystals
in space for obtaining high resolution diffraction data, which will work out very effective
for understanding 3—dimensi0na1 protein structures.
