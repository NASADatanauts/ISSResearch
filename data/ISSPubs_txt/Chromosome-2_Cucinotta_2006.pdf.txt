Abstract:

We review methods and data used for determining astronaut organ dose equivalents on
past space missions including Apollo, Skylab, Space Shuttle, NASA-Mir, and
International Space Station (188). Expectations for future lunar missions are also
described. Physical measurements of space radiation include the absorbed dose, dose
equivalent, and linear energy transfer (LET) spectra, or a related quantity, the lineal
energy (y) spectra that is measured by a tissue equivalent proportional counter (TEPC).
These data are used in conjunction With space radiation transport models to proj ect organ
speciﬁc doses used in cancer and other risk projection models. Biodosimetry data from
Mir, STS, and 188 missions provide an alternative estimate of organ dose equivalents
based on chromosome aberrations. The physical environments inside spacecraft are
currently well understood With errors in organ dose projections estimated as less than
i15%, however understanding the biological risks from space radiation remains a
difﬁcult problem because of the many radiation types including protons, heavy ions, and
secondary neutrons for Which there are 110 human data to estimate risks. The accuracy of
proj eetions of organ dose equivalents described here must be supplemented With research
on the health risks of space exposure to properly assess crew safety for exploration
missions.

"
"2","INTRODUCTION
The health risks to astronauts from space radiation are a major problem for space
exploration, perhaps representing a limiting factor on the maximum mission length under
current risk acceptance levels. Health risks of concern (NRC, 2005) include cancer, acute
radiation sickness, damage to the central nervous system and degenerative effects
including cataracts (Cucinotta et al., 2001a) and heart disease (Preston et al., 2004).
Cancer risk assessment requires evaluation of organ doses from dosimetry and physical
considerations, Which are combined With age and gender dependent risk coefﬁcients to
project mission risk. The inherent uncertainties in this approach are large (NCRP, 1997;
Cueinotta et al., 2001b, 2005; Cueinotta and Durante, 2006) and therefore must be
considered in the assessment of the maximum mission duration or the length of the
individual’s career relative to their participation in one or more space missions. A goal is
to use basic knowledge from biophysics to predict risks through the introduction of an
explicit dependence on biological factors in risk assessment methodologies. It is worth
noting that radiation environments outside and inside of spacecraft have been routinely
measured for nearly 30 years (Badhwar, 2004) With a variety of radiation detectors and
the particle types and energies, and dynamical range of these particles over the solar
cycle are reasonably well understood. However, radiation risk by definition is not
measurable and must be understood from basic knowledge of biological damage coupled
to human radio-epidemiology data When available. Many important biological questions
remain to be addressed before conﬁdence in risk projections for space radiation is
improved to a satisfactory level. This Will occur only through ground based research With
particle accelerators and experimental models of human disease (Cueinotta and Durante,
2006). It is important to accurately assess the organ exposures received by astronauts to
assist the planning and goals laid out for this research.
In this paper we review dosimetry data and organ doses received by astronauts on past
space missions. We describe NASA’s approach to utilize available area and crew
specific radiation dosimetry With models of space radiation transport and vehicle and
body mass-geometry models to estimate mission speciﬁc organ doses, and more
2

dose estimates to results from biodosimetry measurements (Yang et al., 1997, George, et
al., 2001; 2004) using the ﬂuorescence in-situ hybridization (FISH) method to score
chromosomes aberrations in blood samples collected pre- and post-mission on Mir, space
shuttle, and 188.
SPACE RADIATION ENVIRONMENTS
The sources of radiation in space are the galactic cosmic rays (GCR) and solar particle
events (SPE). The GCR consist of high-energy protons, helium nuclei, and heavy nuclei
With energies extending to more than 10 GeV/amu, and SPEs are largely protons With
energies up to a few hundred MeV With a small helium and heavy ion component
(NCRP, 2000). The GCR interaction With the Earth’s atmosphere and magnetic field
creates the trapped protons and electrons belts important for missions in low-Earth orbit
(LEO). The sun’s magnetic ﬁeld modulates the GCR over an approximately 11-year
cycle With a more than a factor of two change in ﬂux rates at the highest conditions called
solar minimum from lowest point in the cycle called solar maximum. This variation is
described by the solar modulation parameter, CD(MV) which is used in the solution of the
time-dependent Fokker-Planck diffusion equation for GCR transport inside the
heliosphere (Badhwar, 1997). Past values and a statistical projection into the future (Kim
et al. 2006) are shown in Figure 1. Solar particle events are more likely to occur at solar
maximum as illustrated in the lower panel Figure 1 where the dates of the largest SPE’s
With ﬂuences protons of 30 MeV of at least 108 protons per cm2 are shown over the last
50-years.
The amount of radiation received by astronauts depends on several factors including
orbital inclination, altitude, position in the solar cycle, and mission duration. The energy
spectrum of each source determines their range in shielding material and the human body.
Trapped electron energies extend to a few MeV With ranges less than about 1-cm in water
and include a small bremstrahlung component capable of reaching larger depths. Trapped
protons have energies extending to several hundred MeV, however more than 90% of the
3

"
"4","ﬂux is from particles With ranges less than 1 cm in water. A small high-energy
component is capable of penetrating crew compartments and tissues producing secondary
neutrons and highly ionizing hydrogen, helium, and heavy ions (Cucinotta et al., 1996).
In contrast to trapped radiation, incident GCR in LEO are dominated by relativistic
particles With energies of 1 GeV/amu or more as the Earth’s magnetic ﬁeld provides
shielding from the lower energy components. Relativistic ions have large ranges and
undergo numerous nuclear reactions in shielding causing a build-up of secondary
particles including neutrons, hydrogen and helium ions, heavy ions, and mesons. The ﬂux
of secondary particles increases for materials With high atomic mass constituents, such
that hydrogen is the most effective shielding material and in-faet materials With heavier
constituents such as steel or lead signiﬁcantly increase radiation doses (Wilson et al.,
1995)
RADIATION DOSE LIMITS FOR ASTRONAUTS
The absorbed dose, D, of radiation represents the amount of energy deposited in bulk
material and is expressed in units ofjoules per gram (J/g) which is given the special name
of Gray (Gy) (1 Gy = 100 rad). For particle radiation, the absorbed dose is expressed as
the product of the ﬂuence of particles (the number per unit area), F and the linear energy
transfer (LET), L as
(1) D = F L
The approach use for estimating risks in humans from atomic nuclei is to consider
experimental models to estimate relative effectiveness factors comparing nuclei to y-rays.
These factors are combined With human data for y-rays to predict risks for nuclei. The
relative biological effectiveness (RBE), defined as the ratio of the dose of a reference
radiation (usually assumed as y-rays) t0 the radiation under study that Will produce an
equal level of effect (for a given experimental observation), is the relative factor used
most often as defined (Butts and Katz, 1967). Values of RBE extending over more than
two orders of magnitude have been observed that are dependent on the biological end-
4

"
"5","point, cell or animal models, the dose and dose-rate, and the type of radiation (NCRP,
2000). Other limitations of the RBE approach include that for practical or ﬁnancial
reasons, RBE’s are not determined for many of the types of radiation or doses and dose-
rates of interest for radiation protection. The diversity of particle types that occur in space
requires a large number of measurements to understand a detailed RBE-LET relationship.
It is possible that high LET radiation produces effects that are qualitatively different from
photons and therefore could not in principle be related to an equivalent dose of photons.
For these and other reasons there are important limitations expected in using a RBE
approach for risk assessment in space, however an alternative has not been accepted at
this time.
National and international radiation protection policy committees make recommendations
on values of RBE’s to be used for assessing risks to humans. The approach taken by these
committees has been to introduce an LET-dependent radiation quality factor, Q(L) 0r
radiation-weighting factor, wR that represent knowledge of RBE’s at low doses and dose-
rates. The role of the committee has been to determine the most appropriate RBE data to
assign values of Q(L). The current values of Q(L) peak at a value of 30 for a LET value
of 100 keV/ttm and decline and higher values of LET (NCRP, 2000). The point dose
equivalent is deﬁned
(2) H = DQ(L)
For evaluating organ dose or organ dose equivalent, the dose and dose equivalent are
summed over the LET spectra at the tissue of interest as described below.
NASA imposes short-term and career dose limits, Which have distinct purposes. Short-
term limits are intended to prevent the occurrence of any clinically signiﬁcant health risk.
And career limits are intended to limit the increased risk of cancer to an acceptable level.
Early radiation effects are deterministic in nature and occur only above dose thresholds,
usually after a signiﬁcant fraction of cell loss in a tissue. Table-la lists the short-term
dose limits followed by NASA. Because very little age- or gender-differences are seen
5

"
"6","for early effects, these limits are age- and gender-independent, and are expected to be
conservative because most solar proton events deliver doses at a low to modest dose-rate
(<0.3 Gy/hr). Recent information suggests that cataract risks from space radiation are
linear With GCR dose (Cuoinotta et al., 2001a), With no apparent threshold, and caused
by genetic damage leading to aberrant cellular differentiation of lens epithelial cells
(Blakely et al., 1999; Worgul et al., 1989). However, questions on the deﬁnition of
clinical signiﬁcance and the progression of cataracts With age must be addressed for the
proper risk assessment for cataracts.
Late effects, such as cancer, are stochastic in nature and some level of risk is incurred
even at low doses. The earliest dose limits used by NASA originated from
recommendations from the National Academy of Sciences using the criteria of a doubling
dose over a 20-yr period for fatal cancer for males of age 35-yr as a basis (NAS, 1970). In
1989, the National Council on Radiation Protection and Measurements (NCRP) issued
their Report No. 98 (NCRP, 1989) that made recommendations of gender- and age-
dependent career dose limits using a risk limit of a 3% increase in cancer fatality. This
upper level of acceptable risk was chosen by comparing to rates of occupational death in
the less-safe industries and noting that the average years of life loss from radiation
induced cancer death (about 15 years) would be less than that of other occupational
injuries (NCRP, 1989; Fry and Naothwey, 1988). In the 1990’s the continued maturation
of the atomio-bomb survivor data and the re-evaluation of the doses received by the
survivors led to further reductions in estimated cancer risks. Recommendations from the
NCRP (NCRP, 2000), While keeping the basic philosophy of their earlier report including
a 3% maximum risk level, result in a lower dose limits than those recommended in 1989
(NCRP, 1989). Continued follow-up of the atomio-bomb survivor is used to refine risk
estimates for cancer and non-oanoer diseases (Preston et al., 2003).
NASA has made several recent changes to the implementation of career limits for fatal
cancer. The quantity excess lifetime risk (ELR) has been abandoned because of the
difﬁculties in comparing ELR to other mission risks, and because in-faot it is poorly
deﬁned mathematically, especially When competing risks are signiﬁcant (Vaeth and
6

"
"7","Pierce, 1990). Instead, NASA is using the quantity risk of exposure induced death
(REID) as a basis for dose limits. Values of REID are generally 10 to 20% higher than
ELR, and more importantly the REID correctly describes competing risks. Because of
the large uncertainties in proj ecting the risk of late effects from heavy ions (Cucinotta et
al. 2001; Cucinotta and Durante, 2006), NASA applies career limits With a concurrent
evaluation of the 95% conﬁdence level (CL) in the uncertainties that enter into the risk
calculations (NCRP, 1997; Cucinotta et al., 2001). Failure to meet the 95% CL initiates a
more stringent set of risk evaluations and mitigation measures, albeit it is not imposed as
an absolute mission exclusion criteria. Table 1B shows dose limits proposed for lunar
missions at NASA using the REID criteria of a 3% limit. Also shown are calculations of
the average life-loss expected if a cancer fatality would occur that are estimated from
human data for 10W LET radiation exposure.
SPACE ORGAN DOSE EVALUATION
The approach used at NASA to determine organ doses is to utilize available radiation
dosimetry from each mission in conjunction With space radiation transport models to
estimate organ dose, dose equivalent, and particle ﬂuence. Area measurements of doses
are considered first and assumed to be made-up of two components; the GCR and trapped
protons including each secondary components. Shielding amounts are described by the
areal density, x, in units of g/cmz, Which represents the physical thickness, t in units of cm
times the material density, p, in units of g/cm3, or x=pt. Areal density is the preferred
quantity for sealing physical parameters describing radiation transport, and for
comparison of the shielding effectiveness of different materials 011 a common mass-scale.
The GCR contribution varies slowly With the amount of shielding and the trapped proton
contribution varies quite strongly becoming negligible at large shielding depth (>20
g/cmz). This observation is used in a re-normalization procedure of transport code results
to the available mission and astronaut speciﬁc dosimetry described next.
The main source of passive dosimetry data are thermoluminescence dosimeters (TLD)
that are worn by each astronaut during his or her mission. In some cases CR-39 plastic
7

"
"8","track detectors have been included in the passive dosimetry packages (Benton, 1986).
Additional information is obtained by TLD’s that are mounted throughout space vehicles
such at the space shuttle, space station Mir, and the International Space Station (188) to
survey the variation of point dose dependencies from shielding variations.
Tissue equivalent proportional counters (TEPC’s) have been ﬂown on some space shuttle
missions and on the Mir and 188. TEPC’s provide time dependent data and a method to
estimate the individual contributions from the GCR and trapped proton doses because of
the strong geographical dependence of the trapped protons. Figure 2 shows the y-
speetrum from a TEPC ﬂown next to the phantom torso experiment on 188 Expedition-2.
It can be seen that GCR ﬂux dominates the exposure in a well shielded location such as
near the human body. Radiation protection protocols use LET and not y in the deﬁnition
of radiation quality factors and is important to understand the differences between these
two quantities (Nikjoo et al., 2002). LET and y deviate because LET represents bulk
energy loss by particles, While y represents the energy deposited in a small microscopic
volume usually taken as a sphere of 1 micron diameter. Figure 3 shows TEPC
measurements from STS-56 for the GCR components and calculations using the
HZETRN codes (Wilson et al., 1990) and a TEPC response model (Cueinotta et al.,
2000a; Nikjoo et al., 2000) that accounts for the differences between y and LET-speetra.
The main differences that occur between LET and y-speetra are due to the escape of a
portion of the energy loss by electrons out of the sensitive volume, the effects of
energetic electrons produced in the walls of the detector, Which lead to anomalous events,
and the high-y resolution of a TEPC (Badhwar and Cueinotta, 2000). These effects are
reasonable understood With TEPC’s over-estimating 0f the average quality factors for
trapped protons and under-estimating average quality factors for GCR. However, TEPC
data can be used to validate models used to predict organ dose equivalents When models
of TEPC response functions are coupled to space transport models, albeit not for a direct
measurement of mission quality factors.
The NASA computer code, HZETRN uses models space radiation environment as a
boundary condition for a Boltzmann equation solver describing radiation transport in
8

"
"9","materials (Wilson et al., 1991). The large number of nuclear fragmentation reactions
requires an extensive physical interaction data-base and the quantum multiple scattering
(QMSFRG) model provides an accurate data base agreeing With over 85% 0f the
measured heavy ion cross sections With less than i25% error (Cucinotta et al., 2006). In
Figure 4 we show contributions of different particle types to space exposures 011 188
(Cucinotta et al., 2000a). The H and He components include the tertiary contributions
produced by neutrons Which increase With shielding. Heavy ions are seen to make up a
major fraction of the dose equivalent due to their higher quality factors at small to
medium shielding depths (£20 g/cmz), and neutrons make dominant contributions at
larger depths.
As shown in Tables 2 and 3, these models reproduce space ﬂight measurements for point
dose and dose equivalent, and organ doses and dose equivalents (Badhwar et al., 2001,
Yasuda et al., 2000) to a high degree of accuracy. However for the ofﬁcial astronaut
records of organ dose equivalent and the risk projection data-base at NASA, the re-
normalization procedure described next ensures that the results match the dosimetry of
record, and represent a further improvement in accuracy over the absolute comparisons
shown in Tables 2 and 3.
A two-dimensional matrix, corresponding to the vehicle and tissue shielding amounts, is
computed for the ﬂux of ion j of energy, E (units of MeV/u) at depth X (units of g/emz) in
spacecraft shielding, and depth 2 (units of g/cmz) in tissue denoted as ¢j-(E,x,z) (units of
ions per cm2 per MeV/u). Matrix of values of the absorbed dose, TLD-dose, and dose
equivalent using the NASA HZETRN computer transport code are then evaluated as
(3) D(x,z) = Z I dE¢j(E,x,z)S,-(E)
(4) DTLD(x,z) = Z I dERTLD(Zj,E)¢j(E,x,z)S]-(E)

"
"10","where SJ-(E) is the ion linear energy transfer, Which depends on kinetic energy and mass

and charge number, Zj. The TLD dose considers a response function, RTLD(Z,E) that

represents the reduced efﬁciency of TLD’s to high LET components. TLD’s under-

estimate the trapped proton dose by about 5% and the GCR dose by about 10% (Yasuda,

et al., 2000). Radiation transport models provide an estimate of the correction of the dose

measured by the TLD t0 the actual absorbed dose. Organ doses for a tissue T are

averaged over shielding at a spacecraft location, n as

Where ax and by are shielding fractions of equal solid angle intervals from a shielding

model for the spacecraft or organ. The “point” dose, Dpt is deﬁned by Eq. (6) for 2:0.

The model organ or tissue dose consisting of GCR and trapped proton component at a

spacecraft location, n, are written as

(7) BTU?) : DT,GCR(n) + 0(DTWD (n)

The ﬁrst re-normalization 0f the model determines the coefﬁcient, aby assuming the

error in the baseline model and measurement is dominated by inaccuracies in the trapped

In applying eq.(8) measurements at 6 locations in the space shuttle and 5 locations in the

188 service module Where passive dosimetry are located are used. Since an astronaut’s
10

"
"11","location is not precisely known during the mission, we make comparisons of dose values

at ﬁxed dosimeter locations to understand possible variations Within a vehicle. The

second re-normalization 0f the model estimated doses is made to the dose recorded by the

Where the C” are fractions of time at speciﬁc locations used to sample from the variations

in the internal spacecraft radiation environment throughout a spacecraft. The organ dose

equivalent is then given by

(10) HT = ﬂZCn [HT,GCR<n> + aHW<n>1

The effective dose (ICRP, 1991) is deﬁned as an average of organ dose equivalents using

the tissue weighting factors, WT, as written

(1 1) E T = 2 WT H T

The tissues weighting factors (ICRP, 1990) are estimates of the average contribution

from speciﬁc tissues to the overall cancer burden With the major sites including the blood

forming organs, stomach, bladder, breast, lung, and gonads. The tissue weighting factors

are deﬁned to reﬂect the total detriment from radiation exposure, Which includes

consideration of the years of 1ife-10ss expected for different types of cancer deaths, cancer

morbidity and hereditary effects, however any age or gender dependence is ignored. For

the astronaut’s Ofﬁcial records, the effective dose is not used and instead risks for solid

cancer and leukemia are calculated individually using age and gender-speciﬁc risk

coefﬁcients, and 95% conﬁdence levels determined using the methods described by

Cucinotta et al. (2001b, 2005, 2006).

Vehicle shielding mass geometry models are used to assess the predictions of radiation
1 1

"
"12","transport codes to the area measurements. Shielding models eXist for the Space shuttle,
the Mir space station, and the 188. These models contain some inaccuracies due to their
method of construction, for e.g., the use of scaling assumptions for distinct materials to
an equivalent aluminum thickness, and Changes in the local interior environment from
mission to mission due to speciﬁc ﬂight manifests. However, in the re-normalization
approach to mission and astronauts speciﬁc dosimetry described above, such inaccuracies
are minimized. In the transport calculations the astronaut is placed at the locations of the
area dosimeters and an approximate average location is deﬁned for the ﬁnal dose
estimates. In actuality only a small variation in the organ dose equivalent is found at the
different locations within a vehicle, albeit the point dose variations (n0 tissue shielding)
can be as much as 50%. One effect that is not accounted for in this procedure is the
astronaut orientation within the vehicle, which can lead to non-negligible variations for
trapped proton doses (Wilson et al., 1995). However because the vehicle and astronaut
are in changing orientations throughout the mission relative to the orientation of the
trapped protons along the s0-called pitch angle distribution (NCRP, 2000), we assume an
average orientation in the calculations. A computerized anatomical model (CAM) 0f the
human body (Billings et al., 1973) is used in this procedure to allow for predictions of
organ speciﬁc quantities including the skin dose at the chest and the lens dose.
DOSES ON SPACE MISSIONS
In Table-4 and Figure—S and we show the average and individual effective dose-rates,
respectively, for all astronauts from all NASA Missions (through 2004). These results use
records of passive dosimetry worn on all NASA missions (excluding the Mercury I and II
missions where dosimetry was not utilized), and estimates of tissue absorption and
average quality factors from ﬂight spectrometers and radiation transport codes. The
effects of the 11-yr solar cycle can be seen in the Changes in dose-rates shown in Figure-
6. Also, dose-rate increase at higher altitudes due to longer sampling of the Earth’s
trapped radiation belts, with the highest dose-rate occurring on the Hubble telescope
launching and repair missions with altitudes near 600 km. Average quality factors range
from about 1.6 to 3.5 with the highest values occurring for GCR dominated missions such
12

"
"13","as the Apollo missions. For the deep space Apollo missions, the GCR dominated
astronaut doses With a small contribution from the trapped belts. The International Space
Station (188) and Mir missions were in a 51.6-degree inclination With altitudes ranging
from about 340 to 400 km have led to effective dose-rates Will range from 0.4 to about 1
mSV/day over the course of the solar cycle. Organ dose equivalents are made-up of more
than 80% contributions from GCR for most missions. US participation on the Mir
missions occurred near solar minimum, While the results in Figure-6 for the ISS
Expeditions 1-10 are at or near solar maximum resulting in a lower dose-rate. The large
number of medium size SPE’s occurring past the most recent solar maximum in 2000 in
effect reduced ISS crew exposures as the solar modulation parameter has remained at
higher values as solar minimum in late 2006 was approached.
Doses received by crews during extra-vehicular activities (EVA) are a particular concern
because there is much less shielding outside a vehicle compared to the interior. NASA
has scheduled EVA’s to occur outside the south Atlantic anomaly region of the trapped
proton belts and outside the higher magnetic latitudes of the Earths magnetic ﬁelds.
Mission planers have agreed to schedule the majority of EVA’s during these orbits,
Which occur over about a 12- hour time period each day. Although data on EVA doses is
not generally available, a comparison of total mission doses for astronauts performing
space-walks relative to other astronauts on the same mission that did not participate in
EVA’s is possible. This comparison is shown in Figure-7 and provides strong evidence
that proper EVA scheduling can be effectively used to ensure EVA doses are negligible.
BIODOSIMETRY ON LONG—TERM SPACE MISSIONS
Biodosimetry offers an alternative method to consider space radiation organ doses that
offers advantages over physical dosimetry. Pros to biodosimetry include providing a
method to include the self—shielding of the body, individual sensitivity, and because
chromosomal damage is know to provide good response to high LET heavy ions and
neutrons, Which is not true for TLD measurements or many other forms of physical
dosimetry. The self—shielding is important because of the loss and gains of distinct
13

"
"14","particle types including energy or LET Changes as radiation passes through tissue, Which
can not be accounted for by a measurement on the body surface. In some cases astronauts
for practical or other reasons do not wear the badges for portions of a mission, Which is
not a limitation With a blood sample. Cons to biodosimetry include statistical limitations
that occur based on the blood sample size, especially at low doses (<50 mSV), and
possible anomalies that may occur in the sample including poor growth simulation and
the presence of clonal aberrations (George et al., 2004). For long missions, it is possible
that a percentage of damaged cells are lost before the post-ﬂood sample is analyzed.
At NASA biodosimetry is performed for all long duration missions using the method of
ﬂuorescence in-situ hybridization (FISH) or Whole cell chromosomal painting. Three
large chromosomes, typically chromosomes 1, 2 and 4 are painted With unique colors and
all other Chromosomes are counter-stained With a dapi blue chemical (George et al.
2004). Aberrations between Chromosomes including translocations, dicentrics, and
complex aberrations are then scored. A pre-ﬂight sample is taken at about 90 days before
the mission and a baseline and dose-response calibration curve for gamma-rays is
determined. The post—ﬂight yield of aberrations, Yf is then compared to the pre-ﬂight
baseline, YZ- and dose calibration curve to estimate a biological dose. Here a weighted
linear regression model is ﬁt the pre-ﬂight sample exposed to gamma-rays at low doses,
Yi=A +BD. The post—ﬂight biological dose is then estimated as Dpos[:(Yf'A)/B. Figure 8
shows a comparison of the biological doses versus effective dose estimates for astronauts
on Mir, a high-altitude Hubble repair mission, and several ISS missions. The left panel
show the biological dose estimate based on the individuals pre-ﬂight calibration curve to
gamma-rays, and the right hand panel is the comparison using pre-ﬂight calibration
averaged over the population of astronauts undergoing biodosimetry evaluation.
Individual variations to the exposure are Clearly eVident in the results.
FUTURE CONSIDERATIONS
The results described here show that astronaut organ dose exposures are now well
described by space radiation transport models With an accuracy of better than i15%.
l4

"
"15","However, for outpost missions to the moon lasting about 180 days or Mars missions
expected to last from 600-1000 days, effective doses from GCR will be much higher
(Table-S) than past space missions because of the absence of the magnetic protection
provided by the Bath from lower energy GCR components and longer duration of the
missions. In addition, a signiﬁcant probability would eXist for one or more large solar
particle events. Dose limits have not been deﬁned for a Mars missions, and await both
new knowledge needed for risk assessment, and considerations of what is the acceptable
level of risk for such missions. Using the recent NCRP risk estimates and organ dose
equivalents we can estimate that no NASA astronaut has achieved a point estimate of
lifetime risk (REID) of more than 1% cancer fatality. However, long-term deep space
missions will incur risks of 3 to 5 % and estimates of unoeItainties in risk estimates
(Cucinotta et al., 2001b; Cuoinotta and Durante, 2006) show 95% conﬁdence levels
exceeding a 10% risk. Also, risks to the central nervous system will be of a higher
concern for a Mars mission than past missions in low EaIth orbit (NCRP, 2000).
Understanding the biological effects of such exposures and developing effective counter-
measures is a major endeavor and is the focus of current research effOIts at NASA. These
problems are a major scientiﬁc challenge, requiring the dedication of the biomedical
research community in the Unites States and other nations with interest in space travel to
realize the necessary solutions.
