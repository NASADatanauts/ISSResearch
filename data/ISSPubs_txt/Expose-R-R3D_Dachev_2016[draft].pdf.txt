Abstract
The R3DR2 instrument performed measurements in the ESA EXPOSE-R2 platform outside
the Russian “Zvezda” module of 188 in the period 24 October 2014-11 January 2016. It is
Liulin-type deposited energy spectrometer (DES) (DaoheV et a1., 2015a). For the first time in
the history of using of the Liulin-type DES spectrometers small solar energetic particles
(SEP) event was monitored outside 188 in November 2014 (DaoheV et a1. 2015d). In this
paper we describe the dosimetric characteristics of the largest SEP event, observed on 22 June
2015 with the R3DR2 instrument outside 188. The main ﬁnding of the paper is that SEP
protons with minimal energy of about 7 MeV at the surface of the R3DR2 detector produced
high dose rates, reaching more than 5000 tLGy h_1, while the inner radiation belt maximal
doses was at the level of 2200 ttGy h_1. If a Virtual external vehicle activities (EVA) was
performed in the same period of the SEP maximum on 22 June 2015, the obtained doses at the
skin of cosmonauts/astronauts can reach 2.84 mGy for siX and half hours, which is identical to
the average absorbed dose inside 188 for 15 days (Reitz at a1., 2005). The comparison with
other extreme events measured with Liulin-type instruments shows that SEPs similar to the 22
June 2015 can be of the most dangers events for the oosmonauts/astronauts at EVA.
1. Introduction
This paper analyses the space radiation environment outside the Russian “Zvezda”
module of ISS generated by different primary radiation sources including: galactic cosmic
rays (GCR) particles, inner radiation belt (IRB) protons, outer radiation belt (ORB) electrons
and relatively low energy SEP protons. Also, there is secondary radiation produced in the
shielding materials of the ESA EXPOSE-R2 platform and the Russian “Zvezda” module. The
dose characteristics in the radiation risks radiometer-dosimeter (R3D) on the Russian
“Zvezda” module (R) R3DR2 instrument also depended on many other variables such as the
ISS orbit parameters, solar cycle phase and current helio and geophysical activity. In this
1

"
"3","study the orbital parameters were calculated by the software KADR-2 (Galperin et al., 1980).
More comprehensive information for the traditional ISS radiation environment was published
in the recently overview by DaoheV et al. (2015a), while here we will concentrate on the SEP
characteristics.

1.]. Solar Energetic Particles (SEP)

The SEP are mainly produced by solar ﬂares, caused by sporadic eruptions of the
chromosphere of the Sun. High ﬂuxes of charged particles (mostly protons, electrons and
helium and heaVier ions) with energies up to several GeV are emitted by processes of
acceleration outside the Sun. It is now generally understood that SEP events arise from
coronal mass ejections (CME) from active regions of the solar surface. The CME propagates
through interplanetary space carrying along with it the local surface magnetic ﬁeld frozen into
the ejected mass. There is a transition (shock) region between the normal seotored magnetic
structure of interplanetary space and the ﬁelds frozen into the ejected mass, in which the
interplanetary gas is accelerated, forming the SEP. As the accelerated region passes an
observation point, the ﬂux intensity is observed to increase dramatically (Mertens et al., 2012,
2013)

The time proﬁle of a typical “impulsive” SEP (Reames, 2011) starts with a rapid
exponential increase in ﬂux, reaching a peak in minutes to hours. The ion energies lie
between 15 and 500 MeV nucleon'1 and the intensity can reach 106 om'2 s'1 sr'l. Electrons
with energies of ~05 to 1 MeV arrive at the Earth, usually traveling along interplanetary ﬁeld
lines, within tens of minutes to tens of hours. Protons with energies of 20 to 80 MeV arrive
within a few to ~10 hours, although some high energy protons can arrive in as little as 20
minutes. SEPs are relatively rare and occur most often during the solar maximum phase of the
approximately 11-year solar cycle. In years of maximum solar activity up to ten ﬂares can
occur, during the years of minimum solar activity only one event may be observed on average
(Lantos 1993).

The geomagnetic ﬁeld provides shielding, by deﬂecting low-momentum solar protons
back to space. Because of the orientation of the geomagnetic ﬁeld, which is predominantly
dipolar in nature, the Polar Regions are susceptible to penetrating SEP particles. At each
geographic location, a vertically incident particle has a minimum momentum per unit charge
(magnetic rigidity) and can reach a given location above the Earth. This is known as the
geomagnetic vertical cutoff rigidity (Shea and Smart, 2001). The local ﬂux of incident SEP
particles a given time varies widely with vertical cutoff rigidity. When vertical cutoff rigidity
is high the SEP ﬂux is low and Vice versa.

We succeed to measure the characteristics of SEPs in September-Ootober 1989 inside
the Russian space station “MIR” with the ﬁrst Liulin type instrument (Petrov et al., 1994;
Smart et al., 1994; Shurshakov et al., 1999;) and with the Liulin-5 dosimetrio telescope (DT)
inside 188 in March 2012 (Semkova et al., 2013, 2014). Some of these measurements were
used in a comparison table in this paper. According to private communication with Prof. J .
Semkova, October 2015, the SPE on 22 June 2015 was not detected inside 188 by the Liulin-5
DT instrument, most probably because of the lack of protons with energies above 60 MeV
(http :// satdat.ngdo.noaa. gov/ sem/ goes/ data/ new plots/2015/goes15/summary/g15 summary
20150601-00h 20150630-24h.1:_)di).

Historically the SEP measurements in 188 are not much. Except the mentioned above 2
papers of Semkova et al. we may add the following papers: (Casolini et al., 2004; Reitz et al.,
2005; Larosa, et al., 2011; Di Fino et al., 2014; Berrilli et al., 2014; Narioi et al., 2015), but
our SEP investigation outside 188 is one of the ﬁrst in the world.

1.2. Solar and geomagnetic conditions in the period 1 7-3 0 June 2015

"
"4","The period 17-30 June 2015 of the R3DR2 active data collection mission took place in
the declining phase of the 24th solar cycle after the secondary maximum in the beginning of
2014 (http://www.swpc.n0aa.gOV/products/solar-cycle-progression). During the period the
solar activity was at low to moderate levels.

A pair of 10 MeV at greater than or equal to 10 cm'2 s'1 sr'1 proton events were
observed at geosynchronous orbit with the GOES 15 “Space Environment Monitor (SEM)""
instrument (http://g0es.gsfe.nasa.gOV/text/databook/secti0n05.pdf. The first event began at 18
June 11:35 UTC, reached a maximum of 16 em'2 s'1 sr'1 at 18 June 14:45 UTC and ended at
19 June 02:30 UTC. This event was associated with the M1 ﬂare observed at 18 June 01:27
UTC (ftp://ftp.swgc.n0aa.gOV/pub/warehouse/2015/WeeklyPDF/pri2077.pdf). The major
event began at 21 June 20:35 UTC, associated with an M2 ﬂare at 21 June 01:42 UTC,
reached a maximum ﬂux value of 1070 cm'2 s'1 sr'1 at 22 June 19:00 UTC and ended 24 June
07:05 UTC. A brief enhancement to the S3 (Strong) http://www.swgc.n0aa.gOV/noaa-scales-
explanation levels was observed due to a shock enhancement from the arrival of the 21 June
CME. Another greater than 10 MeV proton event began at 26 June 03:50 UTC in association
with an M7 ﬂare at 25 June 08:16 UTC, reached a maximum of 22 em'2 s'1 sr'1 (Sl-Minor) at
27 June 00:30 UTC and ended at 27 07:55 UTC
(ftp://ft1:_).sw1:_)c.n0aa.g0v/12ub/wareh0use/2015/WeeklyPDF/1gri2078.1:_)di).

The 22 June SEP event can be classiﬁed as “Gradual” according to Reames, (2011).
This SEP was with soft spectrum, because only protons with energy below 60 MeV was
increased. The highest enhancement by more than 4 order of magnitude was seen in the >5
and >10 MeV channels, while the >100 MeV channel of the GOES-15 SEM instrument was
not enhanced during the maximum 011 SEP on 22 June
(http :// satdat.ngdc.n0aa. gov/ sem/ goes/ data/ new 1210ts/20 1 5/ goes 1 5/sun1mary/ gl 5 summary
20150601-00h 20150630-24h.1:_)df).

Recent private communication with Dr. Nat Gopalswamy, (February 2016), from
Solar Physics Laboratory, Heliophysics Division, NASA GSFC, Greenbelt, USA give us
information that: “The June 22 2015 event is unusual in the sense there were two eruptions
near the Sun, which merged close to the Sun. The acceleration proﬁle of the CME is similar
to a filament eruption event (Gopalswamy et al., 2015), but the CMEs are from an active
region”. The lack of enhanced ﬂux of protons with energies above 60 MeV describes why
enhanced dose rates by SEP protons was not observed on June 22 with the Liulin-5 DT
instrument inside 188, according to the private talk with prof. Semkova in October 2015.

The greater than 2 MeV electron ﬂux at geosynchronous orbit was high levels through
the period 17-30 June with the exception of 23 June. A maximum ﬂux of 26,376 cm'2 s'1 Sr1
was observed at 24 J une 16 :20 UTC
(ftp://ftp.swgc.n0aa.gOV/pub/warehouse/2015/WeeklyPDF/gri20784gdi).

The geomagnetic ﬁeld ranged from quiet to severe storm conditions
http://www.sw1:_)c.n0aa.gOV/noaa-scales-explanation through the period 17-30 June 2015. At
22 June 3 shocks in the geomagnetic ﬁeld was observed, generated by the arrival of 3 CMEs,
which occurred earlier. The global geomagnetic storm index Kp responded with severe storm
periods (Kp=8), observed between 22 June 18:00-21:00 UTC and 23 June 00:00-06:00 UTC
(ftp://ft1:_).sw1:_)c.n0aa.g0v/12ub/wareh0use/2015/WeeklyPDF/1gri2078.1:_)di). In the period 09:00-
15:00 UTC on 25 June 2015 another moderate (Kp=6) magnetic storm occurred.

2. Materials and methods

2.1. R3DR2 instrument description

In order to determine and quantify the radiation field outside the 188 in the ESA
EXPOSE-E/R platform a radiation environment spectrometer-dosimeters of DES type -
R3DE/R was developed through collaboration of the Bulgarian and German teams (Streb et
al., 2002; Hader and DacheV 2003; Hader et al., 2009). The teams worked successfully during
the ESA EXPOSE-E/R missions in 2008-2009 and 2009-2010 time periods, respectively

3

"
"5","(DacheV et al., 2012a, 2015b; Shuster et al., 2012). The currently used R3DR2 spectrometer-
dosimeter on the 188 is in fact the same instrument which was ﬂown in 2009-2010 in the
EXPOSE-R facility but here it is named with the extension R2 only for purposes to
distinguish between the data from the different EXPOSE-R(1) and EXPOSE-R2 missions.

The R3DR2 (see Fig. 1.) is a Liulin-type DES instrument, which was successfully
ﬂown: 1) In the USA Laboratory module of the 188 in May-August 1991 (DacheV et al.,
2002; Reitz et al., 2005; Nealy et al., 2007; Wilson et al., 2007; Slaba et al., 2011, BadaVi,
2014); 2) Inside ESA Biopan-5/6 facilities on Foton M2/M3 satellites in 2005/2007 (Hader et
al., 2009; Damasso et al., 2009); 3) Inside the ESA EXPOSE-E/R facilities outside the
Columbus/Zvezda modules of the 188 in 2008-2010 (DacheV et al., 2012a; Schuster et al.,
2012; DacheV et al., 2015b).

The scientiﬁc objectives of the RDR2 spectrometer-dosimeter exposure were: ﬁrst
connected with the quantiﬁcation of the global distribution and time dynamics of the radiation
ﬁelds, generated by different radiation sources outside the 188; the second purpose is the
dosimetric support for other passive scientiﬁc experiments, related to astrobiology (Rabbow
et al, 2015), which were housed inside the EXPOSE-R2 facility. For all of these experiments
the knowledge of the history of solar and ionizing radiation and the total obtained doses is
highly important for the interpretation of the data collected during the mission.

Figure 1 presents the external View of the R3DR2 instrument as mounted in the
EXPOSE-R2 facility. The R3DR2 instrument is a low mass (0.19 kg), small dimension
(76X76X36 mm) automatic device that measures solar radiation in four channels and ionizing
radiation in 256 channels of a Liulin-type DES (DacheV et al. 2015a). The four solar UV and
Visible radiation photodiodes are seen in Figure 1 as small circles on the surface in the central
part the R3DR2 instrument. The ionizing radiation detector is located behind the aluminum
wall of the instrument and is not seen in the ﬁgure.

The cosmic radiation is determined using a semiconductor detector (2 cm2 area and
0.3 mm thick). A pulse height analysis technique is used to measure the deposited energies

The dose D [Gy] by deﬁnition is one J oule deposited in 1 kg of matter. We calculate
the absorbed dose in the silicon of the detector by dividing the summarized energy deposition
in the spectrum in J oules by the mass of the detector in kilograms:

loss) in J oules in channel “i” and K is a coefﬁcient, which contains the charge of the electron,
the preampliﬁer sensitivity and the spectrometer step.

In (DaoheV, 2009) it was found that the dose rate (D) in mGy h'l) to ﬂux (F) in 0111'2 s'
1) ratio (D/F) characterize well the predominant radiation source. From other hand this ratio
can be interpreted as the speciﬁc dose (SD) of the particle in nGy 01112 partiele'l.

2.2. Instrument calibrations

The R3DR2 DES-type instruments were calibrated in a wide range of radiation fields.
First, they were irradiated in gamma and neutron (137Cs, 60Co, AmBe and 252C1) isotope
sources radiation fields and at the CERN—EC high energy reference field (Spurny and DaoheV,
2003, DaoheV et al., 2002). The absolute values of the dose rates obtained from the
spectrometer are in very good agreement with the dose rates calculated using the EGS4
transport code (http://rowww.kek.jp/researoh/egs/). The values of the measured doses were
found to be within 2.8% of the reference value for the 137Cs source and within 8% of the 60Co
source (Spurny and DaoheV, 2003). We consider that the ﬂux and dose rate errors of the
R3DR2 measurements on 188 are within 10%. The calibrations showed that the spectrometer
had high effectiveness with respect to gamma rays, which allowed monitoring of the natural
background radiation.

Next, the Liulin type spectrometer was calibrated at the cyclotron at Universite
Catholique de Louvain, Louvain-la-Neuve, Belgium (DaoheV et al., 2002) and by using
proton and heavy ion beams in the National institute for radiological sciences (NIRS)
Cyclotron facility and the HIMAC heavy ion synchrotron facility at NIRS, Chiba, Japan
(Uehihori at al., 2002, 2008). All calibration results and also the GEANT-4 and PHITS code
simulations (Ploo et al., 2011) revealed very good coincidence between the measured and
predicted energy deposition spectra and proved the effectiveness of the Liulin spectrometers
for the purposes of characterization of the space radiation ﬁeld (Uchihori at al., 2008). A
recent reView paper (DaoheV et al. 2015a) gives a comprehensive description of the Liulin
type spectrometers developed since 1996 and their calibrations and space results.

The spectrometers effectiveness for neutrons depends on their energy, being minimal
for neutrons with energy of 0.5 MeV and having a maximum of a few percent for neutrons
with energies of 50 MeV. According to the “neutron-induoed nuclear counter effect”
introduced for the Hamamatsu PIN diodes of type S2744-08 (Zhang et al., 2011). Almost all
Liulin spectrometers used the Hamamatsu PIN diodes, and neutrons could be observed in all
channels of the spectrum with a higher probability in the ﬁrst 14 channels.

The ionizing radiation detector of the R3DR2 instrument was mounted about 3 mm
below the 0.5-1.0 mm thick aluminum cover plate. Additionally, there was a technological
shielding of 0.07 mm copper and 0.2 mm plastic material, which provide totally between 0.25
and 0.5 g 0111'2 shielding. For the lower boundary of 0.25 g 0111'2 shielding, the calculated
required kinetic energy of normally falling particles to the detector is 0.67 MeV for electrons
and 12.5 MeV for protons (Berger et al., 2015). For 0.5 g 0111'2 shielding these values are 0.95
MeV for electrons and 20.5 MeV for protons. This means that only protons and electrons with
energies higher than the values listed above can cross the R3DR2 shielding materials and
reach the surface of the detector.

"
"7","Figure 2 presents the unselected by the radiation source hourly and daily dose rates
data for the period 17-30 June 2015. The black circles represent the hourly, while the heavy
magenta line is for the daily dose rates. On the abscissa of Figure 2 is the UTC in the format
(dd), where “dd” is the number of the day in June 2015. On the ordinate axes by linear scale
are plotted the absorbed dose rates in HGy h'1 and HGy day'1 as they was primary measured
from the deposited energy spectra using formulae (1). The reader will be fully disorientated
what the different hourly maxima means and how the dynamics of the maxima are described
without the labels and the rectangles, which give a preliminary idea for the dominant radiation
source.

The GCR hourly dose rate source is seen as heavy black line in the bottom of the
figure with dose rates below 50 HGy h'l. The IRB maxima are the second “stable” radiation
source in the picture with maximal dose rates in the range 1100-2200 HGy h'l. Very low
hourly IRB doses were observed 011 23 June together with the main phase of the magnetic
storm on 23 June. 011 the base of similar IRB dose rate decreases observed in the R3DR2 data
during other magnetic storms we consider that the effect is similar to the described by Zou et
a1., (2011) “Response of high-energy protons of the inner radiation belt to large magnetic
storms”.

The highest in the ﬁgure hourly dose rate maximum of 5,631 HGy h'1 in the early
hours 011 26 June was produced by 45,520 relativistic electrons with energy >0.67 MeV and
average speciﬁc dose (SD) of 0.69 nGy cm2 particle'l. The relativistic electron ﬂux was
intensiﬁed in the recovery phase of the magnetic storm on 25 June and decrease after the
maximum 011 26 June till 30 June.

The SEP maximum is second with dose rate of 5,251 HGy h'1 011 22 June. It was
produced by 2,933 protons with minimal energy 011 the detector surface of 7 MeV and
SD=8.3 nGy cm2 particle'l. Some other SEP maxima eXists in the picture but they are not
recognisable in the bunch of ORB and IRB maxima.

The average R3DR2 daily dose rate for the ﬁrst 5 “typical” days in Figure 2 was 649

"8","3.2. Radiation sources selection procedures

The following four radiation sources was recognized in the data obtained with the
R3DR2 instrument during the period 17-30 June 2015: (i) globally distributed GCR particles
and their secondary; (ii) protons in the SAA region of the IRB; (iii) relativistic electrons
and/or bremsstrahlung in the high latitudes 0f the ISS orbit where the ORB is situated; (iV)
solar energetic protons (SEP) in the high latitudes 0f the ISS orbit.

Historically we developed two similar radiation source data selection procedures
(DacheV, 2009; DacheV et al., 2012a). The simplest method to distinguish between the
contribution of the IRB protons and the ORB electrons is based on the Heffner formulae
(Heffner 1971; DacheV, 2009), which uses the dose to ﬂux ratio (D/F) or the speciﬁc dose
(SD). When the SD is less than 1.12 nGy cm—2 particle_1 then the expected predominant type
of radiation in a 10-s exposition time are electrons in the ORB. When the SD is greater than
1.12 nGy 01112 particle_1, then the predominant source are protons in the IRB. GCR source
contributes to both SD ranges. For the “BION—M” N01 satellite data selection (DacheV et al.,
2015c) we extend this procedure adding analysis of total magnetic ﬁeld strength and ﬂux
values.

Figure 3 presents the result of the selection of the radiation sources using the presented
in the Table 1 criteria. Generally Figure 3 is very similar to Figure 9 by DacheV et al. (2015 a),
that is why we will not describe comprehensively the usual sources as GCR, IRB and ORB.

represent the SD values. Blue rectangles “—
represent the ORB, red circles SEP and ---
green rectangles the IRB dose rate and SD [nGy cm2 particle_1] field [Gauss]
values respectively. It is well seen that
SEP; ORB and IRB sources are clearly
separated from GCR source for ﬂuxes
above 10 cm—2 s_1 level. This is valid also
for doses above 30 uGy h_1 level. The
precise differentiation of the GCR source in the dose rate range of values between 5 and 30
uGy h'1 from other 3 sources is problematic because even the shape of the deposited energy
spectra are looking very similar.

The strong boundary between blue and red and green points represents the SD value
equal to 1.12 in nGy cm2 particle“. This boundary divides the GCR dose rates in two parts as
following: the less energy depositing part (SD<1. 12 nGy cm2 particle“) is connected with the
energetic electrons in ORB source, while the high energy depositing part (SD>1.12 nGy cm2
particle“) is connected with the energetic protons in the IRB and SEP sources.

The presence of SEP particles generate additional dose rate branches (“ﬁngers”),
showed with red circles in the amount of dose and SD points in Figure 3 in comparison with
the Figure 9 by DacheV et al. 2015a. Two different SEP dose rate “ﬁngers” are seen in Figure
3. The largest is above the “traditional” IRB ﬁnger where the maximal dose rates reached
5251 uGy h_1 on 22 June 2015. This “ﬁnger” is associated with the arc of SD points, which
reached value of 8.3 nGy cm2 particle_1 at ﬂux level of 180 cm—2 S“. The lower end of the arc
has values of about 4 nGy cm2 particle“. According to the Heffner’s (1971) formula the SD
values in the range 4-8.3 nGy cm2 particle_1 corresponds to protons with energies in the range
17 to 7 MeV at the surface of the R3DR2 Silicon detector. The second not so well seen
“finger” of SEP SD points is below the IRB “finger” and correspond to protons with energies
between 17 and 200 MeV.

The form and shape of the deposited energy spectra also characterize the different
radiation sources (DacheV, 2009; DacheV et al., 2015a). The analysis of the form and shape of
energy deposition spectra obtained during the Liulin instrument calibrations with 7.8 MeV
proton beam at the cyclotron facility of the University of Louvain, Belgium (DacheV et al.,
2002) and the R3DR2 instrument SEP spectra on 22 June 2015 shows very similar forms and
shapes, which confirm and approve also the selection procedure.

3.3. Selected by the radiation source data presentation

The selected by the radiation source absorbed dose rates, ﬂuxes and specific doses
obtained by the RDR2 instrument in the period 17-30 June 2015 are plotted in Figures 4a to
40 respectively. Blue triangles represent the ORB, red circles SEP and green squares the IRB
parameter values respectively. Same data as in Figure 3 was used but plotted against the time
in the format (dd), where “dd” is the number of the day in June 2015.

The heavy black lines plotted in Figure 4 against the right vertical axes represents:

constant during the period, except the smaller values 011 23 June during the main phase of the

orbits. The smaller descending orbits IRB ﬂux and dose rates maxima can be explained with

Chernykh et a1., 2008). The simpliﬁed explanation is that the located 011 the left side of the
ISS “Zvezda” module, against the ISS vector of velocity, R3DR2 detector is heavier shielded
by the “Zvezda” module body 011 the descending orbits from west to east drifting inner belt
protons, when the 188 is in the nominal “XVV” orientation
(httQ://sgaeeﬂight.nasa.gOV/station/ﬂash/iss attitude.html).

The increase of the IRB SD values up to 6-7 nGy 01112 partiele_1, seen in Figure 4c is
connected with the crossings of the region located in the South-East direction from the centre
of the SAA anomaly maximum, which is populated with protons with lover energies. This
phenomenon is well known since the very ﬁrst LIULIN instrument publications (DaeheV et
a1., 1989). Recently it was described with R3DR2 data in Figures 8 and 9 0f the paper by
DaeheV et a1, (2015d).

"
"11","The ORB ﬂux and dose rate values (blue triangles) show clearly 2 periods in Figure
4b. The first one, starting on 17 June and continuing till 21 June, is characterized with
relatively low ﬂuxes and dose rates seen in the R3DR2 data. On June 22 the ORB ﬂux and
dose rates strongly decrease in the main phase of the magnetic storm (Zheng et a1., 2006). The
comparison of the ORB and IRB ﬂuxes in Figure 4b for this period shows that they are almost
with same values. Because of the larger SD values of the IRB particles the deposited IRB
doses in Figure 4a are much larger than the ORB doses. A11 ORB SD values are less the 1.12
nGy om2 particle_1 and are seen as thick blue area in the bottom of Figure 4c.

The larger ORB ﬂux and dose rate in the period 26-30 June is connected with the
magnetic storm which occurred on 25 June. Generally, the observed ORB time variations are
similar to the published by DaoheV et a1. (2012), that is why we will not analyze the ORB
source variations more comprehensively here. The analysis of the all R3DR2 ORB data will
be the main topic of future paper.

The SEP parameters in Figure 4 are presented with red circles organized in bars. One
single vertical bar contains data from one crossing of the North or South high magnetic
latitude region, where the R3DR2 instrument was irradiated by high energy solar protons.
Bunches of bars seen in the ﬁgure are from 6-8 consequential crossings per day. In the bottom
parts of Figures 4a and 40 well seen is the contribution of the GCR source with dose rates up
to 20-50 uGy h_1 and SD values up to few nGy om2 partiole_1.

In Figure 4a it is seen the nice correlation between the observed on 188 SEP dose
rates, presented with red circles and the more than 30 MeV proton ﬂux, measured on GOES
15 satellite, presented with heavy black line. To explain the origin of the large maximum in
the dose rate observed on 22 June we put again the GOES 15 more than 30 MeV ﬂux in
Figure 40 but in linear scale. It is seen that the GOES proton ﬂux is really enhanced only on
22 June from 0.2 up to 9.4 0111'2 s'1 sr'1 or about 50 times. Similar magnitude of enhancement
is observed in the R3DR2 dose rate values shown with red circles in Figure 4a. The process of
enhanced doses is additionally favored by the SD maximum seen in Figure 40 on 22 June.

ﬂux values outside ISS and the more than 10 and 30 MeV ﬂuxes measured on GOES 15
satellite in geosynohronous orbit for the period of the maximum of the SEP on 22 June 2015.

"
"12","The right vertical axes organize in linear scale: (i) the SEP proton energies calculated
from the dose to ﬂux ratio values using the Heffner proton formulae (Heffner, 1971; DacheV,
2009); (ii) the L values (Mcllvain 1961, Heynderickx et al., 1971) of the point where the
R3DR2 ﬂuxes was measured.

The 188 ﬂuxes in Figure 5 shows 8 maxima observed during the sub sequential
crossings of the high latitude regions in both hemispheres, which is confirmed by the L value
maxima seen with magenta circles in the lower part of the figure. The data were selected as
SEP particles according to Table 1 with additional requirement - the dose rate to be greater
than 50 uGy h_1, which cuts the possible contribution of GCR particles. The maxima was
formed as result of movement of the station toward higher latitudes, respectively larger L
values and lover geomagnetic vertical cutoff rigidity (Shea and Smart, 2001), where solar
protons are able moving along the ﬁeld lines to penetrate down and reach the altitude of the
station. When station start to move back to lover latitudes a reverse process is declining the
ﬂux. The calculated by the Heffner’s formulae (DacheV, 2009; Heffner, 1971) solar proton
energy confirmed this explanation by forming of values as high as 94 MeV at lower L values
and minima of about 7-8 MeV at the position of the ﬂux maxima.

As expected the ISS absolute ﬂux maxima values are situated below the >10 MeV and
above the >30 MeV GOES 15 ﬂux values. Also, the ISS absolute maxima evolvent follows
relatively well the curves of the GOES 15 ﬂux values. The R3DR2 average ﬂux value at
20:10 UT on 22 June 2015 was equal to 20.7 cm2 s'1 sr'l. If we will consider that at high
latitudes the whole measured on GOES ﬂux is transmitted along the ﬁeld lines down to the
orbit of 188 we may calculate, by power law approximation of the GOES ﬂux data for 1, 5,
10, 30, 50 and 100 MeV, that this R3DR2 ﬂux response to 19 MeV proton energy at the
entrance of the instrument, which are divided of 2 parts: 12 MeV in the shielding materials of
the instrument and 7 MeV at the surface of the detector.

The 188 ground level pats with solar proton precipitations cover relatively narrow
geographic locations equatorward from magnetic poles and up to L value equal to 3 in both
hemispheres. The South hemisphere geographic coordinates of this almost trapezoidal area
are (40°E-1700E; 70°E-150°E and (51.6OS-42OS), while the North hemisphere coordinates are
(450W-115OW; 65OW-105OW and (51.6°N-47ON).

We calculate the total accumulated dose for 6 h and 30 In between 16:58 and 23:28
UT on 22 June 2015. For that period there were no measurements, which cover the
requirements to be from predominantly IRB or ORB sources. Solar energetic protons
delivered total dose of 2.84 mGy by ﬂuence of 727,900 particles. The calculated average SD
for solar protons is 5.4 nGy cm2 particle'l, which according to Heffner formulae gives average
energy of the protons impinging at the detector of about 12 MeV. In the same time interval
only 0.18 mGy delivered by 30,060 particles (in average 1.08 nGy cm2 particle'l) can be
devoted to the GGR source.

Keeping in mind that the shielding characteristics of the materials before the detector
of R3DR2 instrument are of the same quantity of about 0.25-0.5 g cm'2 as the space suits
shielding (Shurshakov et al., 2009; Benton et al., 2006) we may conclude that that dose of
2.84 mGy can be delivered to the cosmonaut/astronaut body during a Virtual EVA in this time
period.

According to Stopping-Power and Range Tables for Electrons, Protons, and Helium
Ions (Berger et al., 2015), protons with energy 12 MeV can penetrate down to 2 mm in the
material named A-150 (tissue-equivalent plastic) or skin or eyes of cosmonaut/astronaut.
From other hand the daily average doses reported by Reitz et al. (2005) inside of the 188 was
measured with the DOSTEL instrument in average of 194 uGy day'1 (Reitz et al., 2005, (page
379). That means that for 6.5 hours the cosmonaut/astronaut on Virtual EVA will accumulate
the equivalent of about 15 days dose inside of the 188.

"13","For the purpose to make conclusion we prepare Table 2, which compare different
extreme event data observed with Liulin-type instruments. In column 1 it is seen that we
choose 3 SEP events in 1989, 2012 and 2015 and 2 relativistic electron enhancement (REE)
events (Zheng et 61., 2006) in 2010 and 2015. All data were selected to cover period of about
6 hours and 30 minutes, which is the average continuation of EVAs 0n ISS. The time intervals
were chosen to coincide with the maximum of the observed dose rates or ﬂuxes during the
different events. Only the event in the fourth r0w coincide with a real happen EVA,

"14","In the ﬁrst row of Table 2 the results obtained during the SEP event on 30 September
1989 is shown. This is the most powerful SEP event in our list (pls. look ﬁrst column of Table
2). The data were obtained inside “MIR” space station when the accumulated dose for 6 h and
30 n1 reached 9 times the average daily doses on ISS.

The second row SEP event present data obtained with Liulin-5 DT instrument on 7
March 2012 (Semkova et 211., 2013) being inside 188 shows very small enhancement of the
dose and respectively only 0.6 times the average daily doses. The third row shows the data of
main interest in this paper, which were obtained outside ISS behind shielding of about 0.25-
0.5 g cm2. This is comparable with the US and Russian space suits shielding (Anderson et 211.,
2003; Shurshakov et 211., 2009; Benton et 211., 2006). Nevertheless that the 22 June 2015 SEP
eventp21r21n1eters were the smallest in our table the response is the largest and re21ch~15 times
the average 188 daily doses. We explain this with 2 reasons: (i) only these measurements were
performed outside the vehicle; (ii) only in this case the protons with relative low energies
delivered the main amount of the dose rate.

To underline the importance of the soft “gradual” character of the June 22 SEP event,
we compare the observed during it hourly dose rates with the dose rates observed with
R3DR2 instrument in another small SEP event with typical “impulsive” character (Reames,
2011) on 29 October 2015
(http :// s21td21t.ngdc.no2121. gov/ sem/ goes/ d21t21/ new plots/2015/goes15/summ21ry/g15 summary
20151001-00h 2015103 1-24h.1:_1df). Using the formulas of the linear dependence between ﬂux
and dose rate we found that the values of the dose rate, produced by equal for both events ﬂux
of 10 cm'2 s'1 is 396 nGy h'1 for the June 22 event and much smaller (164 nGy h'l) for the
October 29 event. We explain the difference with the difference in the value of the average
energy at the surface of the detector, seen by the specific dose. The average SD value for the
June 22 event is 8.3 nGy cm2 particle'l, (7 MeV at the surface of the detector), while the
October 29 SEP event average SD value is 4.6 nGy cm2 p21rticle'1 or 15 MeV at the surface of
the detector).

Last 2 rows of Table 2 deal with the events of rel21tiVistic electrons enhancements
(REE) in the ISS radiation environment (Zheng et 211., 2006), which also can delivered large
doses in the skin of 21stron21uts/cosmon21uts during EVA (D21cheV et 211., 2012b, 2013). In the
fourth row was selected the data measured with R3DR1 instruments outside ISS during the
EVA-l of STS-131 mission on 09 April 2010 between 05:31 and 11:58 UT for 6 h and 27 m
(http ://www.n21s21s1321ceﬂi ght.com/ 20 1 0/ 02/ sts- 1 3 0-eV21-1-inst2111-node-3tranguility-to-st21tion/).
It is seen that even in that relatively week, in comparison with the data in ﬁfth row event, the
accumulated dose is 443 nGy, which is equivalent to 2.3 days dose inside the 188.

The fifth row contains data for the burst type REE observed by R3DR2 instrument on
04 July 2015 between 17: 16 and 22:46 UT for 6 h and 30 m, which is characterized by one of
the largest observed by us on 188 electron ﬂux and dose rate, reaching 11,165 cm2 s'1 and
27,020 nGy h'1 respectively. The accumulated dose for 6 h and 30 n1 is equivalent of 7 days
inside 188. Our current understanding for this REE event is that it is sporadic enhancement of
the of the electron ﬂux (large time scale “burst” of electrons on the background of the
weakening electron ﬂux after the magnetic storms on 22 and 26 June 2015. In the R3DR2
2014-2015 data there are more similar sporadic events, which will be object of especially
dedicated new paper.

Conclusion

For the first time in the history of using of the Liulin DES-type instruments in space 21
ﬂux from solar energetic particles (SEP) in the period 1 - 4 November 2014 were detected
(D21cheV et 211., 2015d). In this paper we describe the results obtained during the period 17-30
June, when more powerful SPE on 22 June 2015 was observed by the R3DR2 instrument
inside the EXPOSE-R2 facility outside Russian “Zvezda” module of I88.

"
"15","The main finding of the paper is that SEP protons with minimal energy of about 7
MeV at the surface of the R3DR2 detector produced high dose rates, reaching more than 5000
nGy h_1, while the inner radiation belt maximal doses was at the level of 2200 nGy h_1. If a
Virtual EVA was performed in the same period of the SEP maximum on 22 June 2015, the
obtained doses at the skin of cosmonauts/astronauts can reach 2.84 mGy for siX and half
hours, which is identical to the average absorbed dose inside 18$ for 15 days (Reitz at al.,
2005). For one cosmonaut/astronaut, which is spending 6 months in 188 the additional dose
received in Virtual EVA will enhance it total dose with less than 10%. Although the obtained
dose increase in the unusual June 22 SEP event do not pose extreme risks for the astronauts
being on EVA the “gradual” SEP events with soft spectrum have to be considered as possible
risk source, which requires additional comprehensive investigations.

We explain the observed by us, relatively to other data inside 188, high SEP dose rates
of more than 5000 nGy h_1 with two reasons: (i) those measurements were the ﬁrst reported
outside the 188; (ii) only in this case the protons with relative low energies delivered the main
amount of the dose rate. For comparison, the maximal dose rates reported by Semkova et al.,
(2014) during the SEP event on March 7 2012 inside 188 was 107 ttGy h_1, while the
maximum dose rate reported by Di Fino et al., (2014) for the same SEP, again inside ISS,
reaches 10 nGy h_1. The total accumulated dose observed by Semkova et al., (2014) inside
18$ for the period 05.03—17.032012 was 180 nGy, while the accumulated dose measured
with R3DR2 instrument outside 188 only for 22 June was 2,840 uGy.

The comparison with other extreme events measured with Liulin-type instruments
shows that SEPs similar to the 22 June 2015 can be of the most dangers events for the
cosmonauts/astronauts at EVA.

The main conclusion of the paper that even relatively small SEP events are able to
delivery large doses behind the space suit shielding outside the vehicle. The solution of the
problem, we see in the fast, active measurements at the body of the crew being on EVA. This
will obtain the exact dynamics and total value of the accumulated dose during EVA in the fast
changed surrounding mass distributions (DacheV, 2013). This information will give the
mission support medical staff information to calculate the risk for the health of the crew and
to take decision for the pharmacological treatment if necessary.

Under the requirements speciﬁed by colleagues from Institute of bio-medical
problems of Russian academy of sciences, a new personal dosimetry unit (PDU) for active
measurements at the body of the cosmonaut on EVA is now in development in SRTI-BAS.
The PDU will work, with approved for space battery, during EVA for about 10 hours with
foreseen heating of the detector if the internal PDU temperature falls below -20°C. From the
measured spectra will be calculated the absorbed dose and ambient dose equivalent (Ploc et
al., 2011). The EVA data can be compared with the data from a permanently working unit
inside the station and to be transferred toward the Earth through telemetry channel.
