Abstract
It is well known that gravity affects solidiﬁcation of alloys due to the convective eﬂ‘ects it induces. As a result, different outcomes are
expected if solidiﬁcation experiments are carried out in near—zero gravity conditions achievable in space. Directional solidiﬁcation
experiments were conducted on board the Material Science Lab (MSL) in the International Space Station (138). The experiments, on
Al—7 wt.% Si alloys, were carried out with a low gradient furnace (LGF). The LGF is a Bridgman-type furnace insert for the MSL.
Numerical simulations for two such microgravity directional solidiﬁcation experiments are presented and compared with experimental
results. A front tracking algorithm to follow the growing columnar dendritic front, and a volume averaging model to simulate equiaxed
solidiﬁcation, were employed simultaneously in a common thermal simulation framework. The thermal boundary conditions for the
simulation domain were computed via the temperature readings which were recorded during the experiments. The simulation results include
the prediction of columnar-to-equiaxed transition (CET) and average as-cast equiaxed grain diameters, and agreed with the experimental
results reasonably. The simulations predict that although an undercooled zone forms ahead of the growing columnar front, thermal
conditions in the diffusion-controlled experiments were inadequate to trigger an entirely equiaxed zone without grain reﬁners.
