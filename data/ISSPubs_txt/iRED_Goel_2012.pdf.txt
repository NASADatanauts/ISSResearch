source software, and inverse dynamics were applied in order to determine the muscle

20 Hz sinusoidal force of 0.5 body weight to the force plate data. From the numerical

ancl glutei increased substantially for one—legged squats with vibration compared to
one— or two—legged squats without vibration. Additionally, joint reaction forces for one—
legged squats with vibration also increased signiﬁcantly compared to two—legged
squats with or without vibration. Higher muscle forces and joint reaction forces might
help to stimulate muscle activation and bone modeling and thus might reduce
musculoskeletal deconditioning. These results indicate that the proposed counter—
measure might surpass the performance of the current space countermeasures and
should be further studied as a method of mitigating musculoskeletal deconditioning.
