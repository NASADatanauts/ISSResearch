hypothesised that the absence of gravity would affect its strength. Here, we report the results of
an experiment conducted over the course of 3 space ﬂights, in which we quantiﬁed the power of
the 10-Hz activity in relation to the arrest reaction (i.e., in 2 distinct physiological states: eyes
open and eyes closed). We observed that the power of the spontaneous 10—Hz oscillation
recorded in the eyes—closed state in the parieto—occipital (alpha rhythm) and sensorimotor
areas (mu rhythm) increased in the absence of gravity. The suppression coefficient during the
arrest reaction and the related spectral perturbations produced by eye—opening/closure state
transition also increased in on orbit. These results are discussed in terms of current theories on
the source and the importance of the alpha rhythm for cognitive function.

experiment during the 0dissea (C1, C2 and C3), Cervantes (C4) and Increment9 (C5) space ﬂights to the International Space
Station. Testing on Earth before the ﬂight (Pre-ﬂight 1G) started 110 days prior to launch (L-110 for Increment9) and 50 days prior
to launch for 0dissea and Cervantes (L-50), and continued up to 30 days after return to Earth (R+30). Cosmonauts C1, C2, C3 and
C4 performed the experiments at 0g on two different days around the 4th day (FD4) during a ten-day mission whereas
cosmonauts C5 performed the same testing around the 15th (FD15), the 80th (FD80) and the 155th day (FD155). (B) Schematic
