Fig. A. A) MRI scans of the mid right thigh and the corresponding phantom image. The image shows a muscle contour traced for illustrative pur-
poses. B) The Circular phantom has been distorted at 900 and 2700, forming an ellipse. C) Illustrative example of how the distortion was corrected.
Dotted Circle—actual phantom, solid Circle—distorted phantom, MC—muscle contour, CMC—Corrected muscle contour, R—actual radius, R’—
calculated radius, RL—reference line. The ratio of R to R’ gives a correction factor to correct for distortion in pixels in muscle contour that are at an
angle 6 to the RL.
