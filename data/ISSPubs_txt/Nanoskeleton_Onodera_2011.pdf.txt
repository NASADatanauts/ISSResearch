The effect of the TiOg/transparent conducting oxide (TCO) interface in a photoelectrode of a dye-sensitized solar cell (DSSC) on its cell
performance was investigated using our multiscale simulator, in which we had added a calculation of the voltage loss derived from the Schottky
barrier height (SBH) at the T102 /TCO interface to our previous simulator. We treated the T102 /TCO interface as a series connection of a Schottky
diode of metaI/n-type semiconductor. The thermionic-emission theory was applied to describe the electron transfer and the voltage loss at the
Ti02/TCO interface. The accuracy of the prediction of the current density—voltage (J—V) characteristics of a DSSC employing the cis-
dithiocyanato-bis(2,2’-bipyridyI-4,4’-dicarboxy|ic acid)-ruthenium(|l) (N3 dye) was improved compared with that obtained by our previous
simulator. The effects of the SBH on the open circuit voltage (VOC) and the maximum power output (Pmax), as well as the J—V characteristics, of
the DSSC were discussed. Our results suggest that a TCO with the SBH 5 0.5 is suitable for a DSSC.
