International Space Station and mean arterial BP (MAP) were lower in space compared with pre—ﬂight standing (both p < 0.05). HR
in space was well maintained at pre—ﬂight supine level for up to 6 months in all astronauts while MAP
tended to adapt to a level in between the ground—based standing and supine positions. Also pulse pressure
(PP) decreased over the course of long duration spaceﬂight.
In conclusion, our data indicate that weightlessness relaxes the circulation in humans for an extended
duration of up to 6 months in space.
