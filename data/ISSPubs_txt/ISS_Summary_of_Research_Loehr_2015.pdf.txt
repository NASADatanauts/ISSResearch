"1","ISS EXERCISE COUNTERMEASURES —
PhySIcal Training for Long-Duratlon Spaceﬂight
James A. Loehr; Mark E. Guilliams; Nora Petersen; Natalie Hirsch; Shino Kawashima; Hiroshi Ohshima
INTRODUCTION: Physical training has been conducted on the International Space Station (ISS) for the past 10 yr as a countermeasure to
physiological deconditioning during spaceﬂight. Each member space agency has developed its own approach to
creating and implementing physical training protocols for their astronauts. We have divided physical training into three
distinct phases (preﬂight, in-ﬂight, and postﬂight) and provided a description of each phase with its constraints and
limitations. We also discuss how each member agency (NASA, ESA, CSA, and JAXA) prescribed physical training for their
crewmembers during the ﬁrst 10 yr of ISS operations. It is important to understand the operational environment, the
agency responsible for the physical training program, and the constraints and limitations associated with spaceﬂight to
accurately design and implement exercise training or interpret the exercise data collected on ISS. As exploration
missions move forward, resolving agency differences in physical training programs will become important to maximiz-
ing the effectiveness of exercise as a countermeasure and minimizing any mission impacts.
