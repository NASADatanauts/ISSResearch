Abstract
C001 ﬂames are commonly associated With engine-knock phenomenon in spark ignition engines and autoignition in diesel
engines, and results from low temperature partial oxidation of the fuel air mixture that eventually leads to hot ﬂame
ignition. However, the possibility of a cool ﬂame supporting quasi-steady combustion of a fuel droplet has never been
speculated, let alone been experimentally observed. Recent microgravity droplet combustion onboard the International Space
Station (188) under the Flame Extinguishment (FLEX) Experiment Program showed anomalous combustion of n-heptane
droplets; high temperature combustion followed by radiative Visible extinction and a transition to a second stage bum
characterized by loss of Visible ﬂame emission. In the second stage the droplet regression continues eventually resulting in
extinction diameters characteristic of diffusive extinction. Experimental examples of the two stage burning and extinction
characteristics of isolated n-heptane droplets under microgravity conditions are presented and analyzed numerically. Predictions
show that the second stage combustion occurs as a result of chemical kinetics associated With classical premixed “C001 F lame”
phenomena. In contrast to the kinetic interactions responsible for premixed cool ﬂame properties, those important to cool ﬂame
droplet burning are characteristically associated With the temperature range between the turnover temperature and the hot
ignition. Initiation of and continuing second stage combustion involves a dynamic balance of heat generation from diffusively
controlled chemical reaction and heat loss from radiation and diffusion. Within the noted temperature range, increasing reaction
temperature leads to decreased chemical reaction rate and Vice versa. As a result, changes of heat loss rate are dynamically
balanced by heat release from chemical reaction rate as the droplet continue to burn and regress in size. Factors leading to
initiation of the second stage burning phenomena are also investigated. The chemical kinetics dictating the second stage
combustion and extinction process is also discussed.

1. Introduction

Since 2009, the Flame Extinguishment (FLEX) Experiment has been conducting isolated droplet combustion
experiments aboard the International Space Station (188). The overall goal of these experiments is to determine and
analyze burning behavior, limiting oxygen index, and extinction mechanisms as a function of fuel, drop diameter,
pressure, oxygen index, and dilution (using various diluents, including helium, nitrogen, and carbon dioxide) [1].
Unique to microgravity experiments is the ability to study a wide range of initial drop diameters so as to characterize
both radiative and diffusive extinction phenomena. In the ﬁrst phase of the program, methanol was utilized to
obtain data on a non sooting fuel which absorbs combustion products over its burning history, notably water [1, 2].
More recently, the study of hydrocarbons was initiated using n-heptane as the fuel. In the case of methanol,
classical diffusive and radiative extinction phenomena are observed, and a detailed numerical analysis of the results
has recently appeared [2]. In the n-heptane experiments, radiative heat loss from larger diameter, ignited droplets
results in cessation of classical (high temperature) droplet combustion behavior at a relatively large droplet size. In
contrast to the classical radiative extinction observed with methanol, a transition to a second stage of low
temperature constant burning rate behavior characterized by loss of Visible ﬂame emission follows; indicating an
anomalous combustion characteristic. In this second stage the droplet continues to undergo rapid and apparent quasi-
steady vaporization without the presence of a Visible ﬂame. This second stage burning and droplet regression
continues, eventually resulting in diffusive extinction at a ﬁnite drop size that then apparently experiences additional
time-dependent evaporation into the surrounding environment. This dual mode of combustion is only observed for
sufficiently large initial droplet diameter; at smaller droplet diameters, classical single stage burning and high
temperature diffusive extinction occurs.

Simulations are conducted to elucidate the inﬂuence of the coupled physico-chemical processes that triggers the
observed dual-mode behavior. Simulations were conducted using a recently developed, one-dimensional, sphero-
symmetric, transient combustion model [3]. The predictions from the model is compared against the recent 188 n-
heptane droplet experiments [1]. Predictions from the model were found to compare favorably with the
experimentally measured droplet and ﬂame diameter evolution. Special attention is given to delineate whether the
observed ﬂames result from classical NTC, “Cool F lame” kinetic behavior or are other driving factors responsible
for the dual-mode/two stage combustion process.

2. Mathematical Model

The mathematical model employed in this current work is a transient, spherosymmetric droplet combustion model
featuring detailed gas phase kinetics, spectrally resolved radiative heat transfer and multi-component gas phase
transport. Details of the model have been reported in some of our recent publications [2, 4]. A brief description of
the model is provided here. The model comprises of species conservation for each of species considered and energy
conservation in both the phases. The complete set of coupled partial differential and algebraic equations are
discretized first in space and then integrated in an automated fashion as a set of coupled ordinary differential-
algebraic equations in time. Spatial discretization is performed according to a node-centered finite volume scheme
with a second order accuracy. The volume boundaries are defined to coincide with the liquid—gas interfacial and the
far field (two hundred times the initial droplet diameter) boundary is well deﬁned using Dirichlet conditions and
remains ﬁxed in the simulations. The Dirichlet conditions imposed on the far-ﬁeld are of ﬁxed ambient composition
and temperature. The innermost liquid node is centered at the origin, providing the required no-ﬂuX condition. The
discretized mass ﬂux is represented on cell interfaces and not cell centers, in the manner traditionally referred to as a
staggered grid to avoid oscillatory solutions. Numerical integration of the ﬁnal set of discretized equations is
performed using a backward difference formula with a variable order of up to fifth order and a variable time step
utilizing a fully implicit multipoint interpolation. This makes it appropriate for the large range of time scales and
stability constraints imposed by chemically reacting systems when combined with automatic time-step variation.

Fig. 1. Measured and predicted evolution of : (a) droplet diameter and (b) ﬂame radius for a n-heptane droplet in ambient air (d0 = 3.91 mm, 0.21
X02, 0.79 XNZ, one atmosphere pressure). The experimental data are that of [1]. The ﬂame radius experimental data contains measurement from
both a color camera (Color) and low light UV (LLUV) camera. Predictions are shown With both the detail chemical kinetics model and the high

temperature n-heptane model of Chaos et a1. [5].

To get insight into the anomalous dual stage burning characteristics and hence affirm the combustion regime
simulations were conducted With two chemical kinetics model, a “detailed” chemical kinetics model and a high
temperature n-heptane chemical kinetic model [5] separately. It should be noted that the “high temperature” model
of Chaos et al. was speciﬁcally developed for high temperature oxidation and did not include any low and
intermediate temperature reaction pathways. Figure 1 shows the predicted droplet and ﬂame diameter evolution
from both these kinetic models and compares them to the experimental measurements [1]. The experimental
conditions are do = 3.91 mm, 0.21 X02, 0.79 XN2, one atmosphere pressure and is referred to as the base case. It can
be seen that the predictions from the two kinetic models are distinctively different. The “high temperature” model
predicts extinction of the droplet at a large droplet size due to radiative heat losses [2, 6] associated With the larger
droplet size. After extinction the droplet is predicted to undergo evaporation in the quiescent environment, Which is
evident in the droplet diameter regression. Consistently the ﬂame diameter evolution predictions With “high
temperature” model shows an abrupt decrease corresponding to the ﬂame extinction. In the simulations the peak
temperature is utilized as the ﬂame position marker as has been done some of our previous work. [2, 3]. As a
consequence the ﬂame diameter shows continuing evolution even after extinction. The “detailed” model shows
signiﬁcantly different combustion characteristics and captures the experimental observation qualitatively. The
“detailed” model indicates that following the Visible ﬂame extinction Which corresponds to the typical radiative
extinction the droplet transitions to a second stage combustion Where droplet diameter regresses at a significantly
higher rate suggesting higher burning rate. In addition the “detailed” model predicts extinction towards the end of
the second stage burn. During this second stage the ﬂame diameter is found to be signiﬁcantly smaller, locating
itself very close to the droplet surface. Due to the large radiative heat loss (Figure 4) the ﬂame positions itself closer
to the droplet surface to compensate and sustain continuous burning. It can be seen that during the second stage the
ﬂame temperature is significantly lower and has a value of ~ 750K. The predictions from the “detailed” model are
very similar to the “high temperature” model in the ﬁrst stage the only difference being the temporal location of the
transition. In comparison to the experiments the “high temperature” model shows an earlier extinction of the Visible
ﬂame in contrast the “detailed” model predicts the transition to occur slightly later and is in good agreement With the
experiments. Even though the “detailed” model qualitatively captures the experimental measurements, the second
stage burning rate is signiﬁcantly over predicted and Vice versa for the extinction diameter. The predicted extinction
diameter was found to be ~0.35 mm being smaller by a factor of 3.5 than the experiment.

mm, 0.21 X02, 0.79 XNZ, one atmosphere pressure).

The “detailed” model only provided qualitative agreement With the experimental measurement thus it is critical to
obtain insight into the defining parameters of this discrepancy and at the same time determine the uncertainty limits
of the predictions. The predictions from the “detailed” model showed very good agreement With the ﬁrst stage
measurement data. It is therefore the second stage combustion process that is not accurately predicted. As such
simulations were conducted by perturbing each of the low temperature reactions individually (increase/decrease by a
factor 2) to obtain the uncertainty bandwidth of the predictions and at the same time find out the sensitiVity of the
reactions to the average burning rate (Kg7 avg) and extinction diameter (dew). Figure 2 depicts the prominent sensitivity
coefﬁcients of droplet burning rate and extinction diameter on the reaction rates for the second stage burn. The
sensitiVity coefficient is identiﬁed as S = @10gF(k)/610gk = @F(k) k/ (3k F (k) Where F is the target value Which
for this case is the average burning rate and extinction diameter. The sensitivity coefﬁcient can be expressed by a
finite difference formula, S = [F (2k) — F (0.5k)]k / 1.5k F (k) = [F (2k) — F (0.5k)] / 1 .5F(k) , Where the numerator
represents the difference in the target value When the reaction rate is increased and decreased by a factor of two and
the denominator denotes the target value for an unperturbed reaction rate. A positive sensitivity coefficient
corresponds to a direct inﬂuence i.e. an increase in the parameter results in an increase in the target value and Vice
versa for negative sensitivity coefficient. The reactions having the most inﬂuence on the second stage burn was
found to be isomerization of QOOH02 to ketohydroperoxide ( QOOHO2 —> Ketohydroperoxide+ OH ) and
dissociation of QOOH02 (QOOHO2 —> QOOH + 02 ); Q = C7H14 for this case. In general, increase in the rate of
QOOHO2 —> Ketohydroperoxide+OH increased the burning and consequently decreased the extinction diameter.
A Vice versa is observed for the dissociation reactions. At temperatures lower than approximately 900K, the ,8 -
scission of alkyl radicals and internal H-atom abstraction reactions are slow to occur due to their high activation
energies [7]. Under these conditions the most of the alkyl radicals (R) go through 02 addition resulting in the
formation of alkyl peroxy radicals R02. The alkyl peroxy radicals (R02) undergo isomerization to form QOOH
Which is the major pathway for the production of QOOH. The QOOH02 is formed by the addition of 02 With

"

QOOH. At the low temperature regime the chain branching is mainly due to the reaction pathway leading through
the ketohydroperoxide species. Hence the QOOHO2 —> Ketohydroperoxide + OH reactions have a positive effect on
the second stage burning rate and Vice versa for the extinction diameter. On the other hand the chain propagation
reactions of QOOH species leads to the formation of cyclic ether, conjugate oleﬁns and ,8 decomposition products
resulting in lower reactivity in the NTC regime. Therefore an increase in the QOOH02 dissociation rate to QOOH +
02 decreases the second stage burning rate and accordingly increases the extinction diameter.

Fig. 3. Predicted evolution of (a) droplet diameter and (b) burning rate with the revised chemical kinetics model (do = 3.91 mm, 0.21 X02, 0.79
XNZ, one atmosphere pressure). Inset of experimental Visualization of ﬂame and droplet diameter is also provided which shows the continuing
diameter regression after the ﬂame extinguishment.

After identifying the most sensitive reactions for the second stage burn, simulations were conducted by
modifying the reaction rates of these ten reactions to their uncertainty limit. For that the reaction rates for the
QOOHO2 —> Ketohydroperoxide+OH reactions were decreased by a factor of 2 and the reaction rates for the
QOOHO2 —> QOOH + 02 reactions were increased by a factor of 2. It should be noted though that the
modiﬁcation of these ten reaction rates is simply to observe their combined inﬂuence on the droplet combustion
characteristics and it also brings forth the notion that the reaction rates for these ten reactions should be further
investigated which is however not a scope of this work. Figure 3 presents the comparison of the measured and
predicted droplet diameter and burning rate evolution utilizing the revised chemical kinetics model. It is evident that
the predictions from the revised chemical kinetic model show better agreement with the measurements. The
predicted average burning rate is obtained by time-averaging the instantaneous burning rate (KO) between t = 0.1tg7
and t = 0.95t17 where tb is the total burn time (ignition to extinction). Comparing to the base kinetic model the
revised chemical kinetics model predicts an average burning rate (Kb avg) of 0.385 mmz/s and extinction diameter
(dew) of 0.95 which is lower and higher by a factor of 1.15 and 2.38 respectively. In addition the second stage ﬂame
temperature is predicted to be~ 700 K by the revised kinetic model which is lower by 50 K than that of the base
kinetic model predictions. However it should be noted that the model slightly over predicts the average burning rate
and Vice versa for the extinction diameter in comparison to the experimental measurements. The disparity between
the two is most possibly a result of the well known perturbing effect of drift velocity. Ignition delay time and
oxidation speciation predictions with the revised kinetic model were also found to be in improved agreement in the
low and NTC temperature regime.

The integrated heat generation (Qgenemn-OH) and losses due to radiation (Qradz'atz'on) and conduction (Qconduction) are
presented in Figure 4. Figure 4 shows that the integrated heat generation has a very sharp rise during ignition which
also decreases very rapidly as a somewhat quasi-steady diffusion ﬂame structure is established. The decrease in
Qgenemﬁon after ignition is also a consequence of the increasing radiative loss deiaﬁon during the ﬁrst stage of the burn
when the ﬂame radius is still increasing (Figure 1). At the same time the conductive heat losses is also substantial. In
this ﬁrst stage of combustion the radiative heat loss is almost a factor of ~ 2 higher than the conductive losses. It can

"
"6","Tanvir Farouk /Procedia Engineering 105 (2015) 520 — 528 525
be clearly seen that the transition to the second stage “cool flame” like behavior is initiated by the heat loss
mechanism. The transition to the second stage occurs When the summation of the heat loss terms are close to the heat
generation. As signiﬁcant heat loss dominates the combustion process the ﬂame positions itself close to the droplet
surface for compensation as it is evident in Figure 3. During the second stage the Qgenemﬁon is found to be ~ 17 W. On
the basis of a time averaged heat generation rate of 150 W in the “high temperature” ﬁrst stage the heat generation in
the second stage is found to be ~ 11.5%. It is interesting to further note that during the second stage the dominant
heat loss mechanism transforms to conduction from radiation. This is due to the fact that during the second stage as
the ﬂame is very close to the droplet surface the radiative heat loss decreases significantly.

Fig. 4. Total heat generation, radiative and conductive heat losses for a n-heptane droplet undergoing two stage combustion in air (d0 = 3.91 mm,
0.21 X02, 0.79 XNZ, one atmosphere pressure).

More recent ISS n-heptane isolated droplet combustion experiments at three atmospheres pressure and the same
oxygen index but With diluents inhibiting heat loss shows “multiple cycles” of dual stage combustion i.e. hot — cool
ﬂame transitions. The experiments are typically conducted for larger droplet sizes, d0 ~3 — 5 mm. For every
experiment the combustion chamber is ﬁlled With the desired ambient gas mixture, consisting of oxygen, nitrogen
and carbon dioxide to a pressure of 3.0 atm. In these experiments the ﬂame steadily grows in diameter and decreases
in luminous intensity to the point at Which it reaches its maximum diameter Where it then either suddenly
extinguishes or begins to eXhibit oscillatory behavior just prior to extinguishing. The oscillatory behavior is marked
by repeated transitions between a complete and partial spherical ﬂame surface and lasts for a brief period of time
before completely extinguishing. The extinction of the Visible ﬂame commences the low temperature second stage
burning regime, qualitatively referred to as the “Cool Flame” regime. During the second stage burning, rapid
droplet vaporization persists and is only momentarily interrupted by the occurrence of one or more hot ﬂame re-
ignition events, typically lasting less than 1.0 s. The re-ignition event is initiated from a small region on the spherical
surface that is eventually deﬁned by a fully enveloping, re-ignited hot ﬂame. This re-ignited high temperature ﬂame
has a diameter signiﬁcantly larger than the preceding high temperature ﬂame Which had previously radiatively
extinguished. An example of this re-ignition is provided in Figure 5 Where a sequence of images taken 0.066 s apart
shows the re-ignition kernel and the resulting ﬂame wrapping around the contour of a spherical shell, presumably
defining the stoichiometric surface. The re-ignited high temperature ﬂame is not sustainable because, as With the
original ﬂame, its hypothetical ﬂame radius Without radiative loss exceeds that radius at Which radiation loss exceeds
heat generation.

Figure 6 shows the predicted droplet diameter and ﬂame diameter evolution along With the experimental
measurements. The experimental conditions are do = 4.08 mm, 0.21 X02, 0.75 Xcoz/balance N2, at three atmosphere
pressure. It can be seen that the predictions from the model agree favorably With the experimental measurement and
captures all of the qualitative trends of the intricate features; especially the mutli-cycle two stage burning. The
predicted droplet diameter regression rate is slower in comparison to the experiment. Likely experimental sources
that may perturb the spherosymmetric result include slow gas/drop convection as a result of residual droplet drift [8]
and movement along the tethering fiber, both of Which may affect burning rate and the incomplete spherical ﬂame
structure/oscillatory behavior noted during transitions from low temperature burning to the second hot burning
phase. It is apparent that in comparison to the atmospheric pressure experiments (Figure 1) the measured droplet
diameter regression rates at elevated pressures show signiﬁcantly greater departures from the local time averaged
values. There exist multiple non-linear regimes in the droplet diameter regression rates. The ﬂame diameter
evolution presented in Figure 6b shows an example of this dynamic behavior. Initially the ﬂame diameter is found to
be large and together With the peak temperature evolution it is indicative of high temperature burning. Following the
initial high temperature burn, the ﬂame diameter is observed to decrease rapidly as a result of radiative heat loss, and
transitions to the ﬁrst 10W temperature/”Cool F lame” mode. Three subsequent initiations of transient hot ﬂame
burning of very short duration are each followed by a longer duration, “Cool F lame” burning period. In every hot-
cool ﬂame transition, the ﬂame diameter is found to decrease by ~ 40- 50% of the prior cycle, maximum hot ﬂame
radius. Based on the predicted ﬂame diameter evolution, the first transition to “Cool Flame” (i.e. Visible ﬂame
extinction) is observed at t = 2.4 s, the first re-ignition at tb = 4.64 s, the second and the third/last re-ignition

occuring at tb = 14.56 s and tb = 21.64 s. The predicted onset of second and third re-ignition that coincides With the
experimentally observed ‘ﬁrst’ and ‘second’ cases differs by ~ 2 5. However, the difference between the predictions
and measurements during the very early stages (0 S tb S 5.0 s) are likely the result of non-idealities in experiment
and modeling of the experimentally aspherical, but symmetric hot Wire ignition energy addition method. The initial
ignition energy is known to signiﬁcantly affect the transient establishment of the initial high temperature burning
phase [9].

4. Concluding Remarks
n-heptane droplet combustion under microgravity conditions has been successfully simulated using a recently
developed transient spherosymmetric droplet combustion model. The simulation showed unique two stage “C001
Flame” like combustion behavior for large sized droplets. Unlike classical “Cool ﬂames” these two stage
combustion initiates at the high temperature combustion and then transitions to the “C001 ﬂame” combustion
process. The predictions from the simulations were found to be in good qualitative agreements With the
experimental measurements The simulation results further indicated that heat losses initiates the two-stage behavior.
