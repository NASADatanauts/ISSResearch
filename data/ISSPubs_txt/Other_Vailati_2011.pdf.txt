We present the results of measurements of giant nonequilibrium ﬂuctuations in a single
component ﬂuid (density ﬂuctuations) and a mixture (concentration ﬂuctuations) driven by
applied temperature gradients, both on Earth and in space. Flight data were obtained during
the September 2007 FOTON M3 mission. Spatial power spectra obtained using the
shadowgraph method, during ﬂight, conﬁrm that the asymptotic IVT '2 q‘4 behaviour extends
to such low wave vector q , as to be limited by the sample thickness. Quantitative comparison
with theory is provided, and is generally quite good. Temporal sequences of shadowgraph
images for the mixture, both on Earth and during ﬂight will be presented to emphasize the
dramatic differences. Fluctuation lifetimes of thousands of seconds were observed during
ﬂight. The rugged but sensitive shadowgraph scattering method (phase ﬂuctuations below 10
milliradians measured to within a few percent absolute accuracy) will be described brieﬂy.
1. Introduction
Equilibrium ﬂuctuations are usually small and limited to molecular length scales. A notable exception
occurs for ﬂuids near second-order phase transitions where correlations readily extend to the micron
scale as evidenced by the impressive phenomenon of critical Opalescence [1]. While critical
phenomena was one of the most studied areas in the sixties and seventies, a great amount of work was
also carried out during that period in connection with two quite diverse physical systems, the laser, and
the Rayleigh-Bénard (RB) convective instability (a liquid slab heated from below). These are
examples of a general class of instabilities in open systems exhibiting a threshold value for the control
parameter, above which macroscopic structures are formed. It was shown that the behaviour near the
threshold of these instabilities closely mimics mean-ﬁeld behaviour of critical systems, in the sense
that system properties (order parameter, amplitude of ﬂuctuations, relaxation times) present a power-
law dependence on the control parameter much like that observed close to a classical critical point [2-
4].
The literature on this topic is too vast to be quoted here. We single out however a UC Santa
Barbara paper where large ﬂuctuations below the onset of convection were ﬁrst observed and

measured [5]. It was shown that ﬂuctuations below threshold peaked around the wave vector of the
convective pattern that eventually materialized above threshold, in keeping with critical ﬂuctuations
scaling arguments. The amplitude was also measured and agreed with theory to within experimental
accuracy of about 50%. We quote Ref. 5 here because it is the ﬁrst reported utilization of quantitative
shadowgraph methods to study large-scale non equilibrium ﬂuctuations.

This paper presents results obtained using the shadowgraph method to measure long-range non-
equilibrium ﬂuctuations in both a ﬂuid mixture and a single component ﬂuid. The measurements were
made both on Earth and during a ﬂight experiment, the 13-day Foton-M3 mission. None of these
measurements could have been performed without quantitative shadow methods.

The ﬂuctuations we will discuss occur quite readily without the necessity of being close to a
generalized critical point. Very much like the critical ﬂuctuations, these are non propagating
ﬂuctuations that scatter into the central Rayleigh component of the spectrum of the scattered light. The
relevant theoretical work [6-9] was developed over a few years, without immediate reaction from
experimentalists. It showed that subjecting a ﬂuid or ﬂuid mixture to a stabilizing temperature gradient
by heating from above should result in non-equilibrium ﬂuctuations with amplitudes and spatial
ranges many orders of magnitude greater than those of equilibrium ﬂuctuations. Incidentally, non
equilibrium propagating ﬂuctuations under a temperature gradient were studied in Refs. 10 and 11
slightly earlier than references above, the effect of the gradient being of generating an asymmetry
between the frequency shifted Brillouin components. For the non propagating ﬂuctuations we describe
here, the hallmark of such gradient-driven ﬂuctuations is the asymptotic behaViour for the structure
factor of an unbounded sample in the absence of gravity. On Earth, gravity quenches this divergence at
a well-deﬂned wave vector determined by the ﬂuid properties, while in the absence of gravity, the
finite sample thickness was predicted to be the only limiting factor. Physically, the ﬂuctuations are due
to the coupling of thermal velocity ﬂuctuations, with the quantity exhibiting a gradient (temperature or
concentration, e.g.). While they have no effect on a homogeneous system, when they occur along a
density or a concentration gradient, they can generate large ﬂuctuations by displacing parcels of ﬂuid
having different density or concentration along the gradient. The limitation of such gradient-driven
ﬂuctuation on Earth occurs because very long wavelength ﬂuctuations are suppressed by buoyancy
which acts as a restoring mechanism for the displaced ﬂuid parcels. In fact, such a restoring force can
even result in oscillatory motion for sufﬁciently long wavelength ﬂuctuations. Because of buoyant
forces, S(q) saturates to a constant below a critical wave vector qc, which for a concentration
gradient V0 is given by qc = (,8ch/ (VDC ))1/4 , where ,8 is the solutal expansion coefﬁcient, g is
the acceleration of gravity, V is the kinematic Viscosity and DC is the concentration diffusion
coefﬁcient. For most common mixtures qc is of order few hundred cm'l.

When the predictions were made they raised the issue of why not even a hint of the eXistence of
these anomalously large ﬂuctuations had ever been observed, despite the fact that solutions and
mixtures subjected to gradients had been studied for many years. For example, using free diffusion
methods to determine diffusion coefﬁcients, or analytical centrifuges to obtain molecular weight
through schlieren-sedimentation proﬁles [12], or while measuring Soret coefﬁcients optically [13].

The reasons why they escaped observation are quite diverse and to some extent rather fortuitous.
F irst, the common techniques use optical methods with the aXis orthogonal to the applied gradient,
while theory indicates that effects are maximized when the optical aXis is aligned with the gradient, a
geometry that is inappropriate (and very unpractical) for all the above methods. Second, because of the
weak dependence of qc on density mismatch, it turns out that for any choice of single-component
liquid and any mixture or suspension, gradient driven ﬂuctuations on Earth remain conﬁned to length-
scales of the order of ten to a hundred microns, and this means that they were unlikely to be observed
by Visual inspection. F inally, the optical distortion introduced is rather modest in comparison with the

critical opalescence effects one would eXpect for a critical ﬂuid with the same correlation length-scale.
Critical opalescence implies that scattering is so strong, that it usually develops into strong multiple
scattering, which in turns implies that a plane wave front will suffer random phase distortions large
compared to 7: in passing through the sample. Here, as we will show, wave front distortions remain a
small fraction of 7: , and consequently instrumentation of high sensitivity is required to detect them.
The stronger disturbance caused by critical opalescence is due to the fact that the structure function
S (q) decays approximately as q‘2 rather than as q‘4 , and thus integration over wave vector results in
large total scattering cross-sections.

The ﬁrst observation of non-equilibrium ﬂuctuations in a simple liquid subjected to a (stabilizing)
temperature gradient is due to the Sengers group at the University of Maryland [14, 15]. The technique
employed was a form of dynamic light scattering in which the scattering was optically mixed with
stray light. The scattering due to the non-equilibrium ﬂuctuations was very small compared to the
enormous stray light contribution from optical imperfections and other sources. As dynamic
measurements were performed, it was possible to cleanly separate the true signal from the stray light,
and the q‘4 dependence was clearly observed, as well as the |VT|2 behaViour. The accessible
scattering angles were much too large however, to permit the detection of the gravitational cutoff, and
the Authors concluded that it was unlikely that it would be detected in the future. Ref. 14 and 15 are
groundbreaking papers proving that experiments could be successfully executed in this area.

Subsequently, ultra low angle scattering and shadowgraph methods were employed by the Milan
group to investigate non-equilibrium concentration ﬂuctuations in Soret—driven and free diffusion
processes [16, 17]. The cutoff at low q due to the presence of gravity was observed, and found to be
in excellent agreement with theory. Particularly important for the history of this project is a paper in
Nature [17], describing an experiment in which no applied thermal gradient was involved, but instead
the driving mechanism was the creation of a pure concentration gradient Via the separation of two
miscible solutions and subsequent free diffusion process. In the associated comment in the News and
Views section, it was suggested that an experiment in microgravity conditions would be highly
desirable, as this would give the possibility of observing ﬂuctuations at length scales comparable with
the physical size of the sample.

It was then decided to j oin forces between the Milan group and the UCSB group, proposals were
submitted to BSA and NASA, and eventually the GRADFLEX (GRAdient Driven FLuctuation
EXperiment) project was launched. It was decided that two experiments had to be ﬂown, one on a
single-component ﬂuid (SINGLE), to be primarily the responsibility of the UCSB group, and one on a
mixture (MIXTURE), for which the Milan group assumed primary responsibility. Both experiments
employed a temperature gradient as the stimulus. It was applied to a 3-mm thick carbon disulphide
sample in SINGLE to study density ﬂuctuations and to 1-mm thick sample consisting of a 1.8 wt.%
solution of MW = 9,100 polystyrene dissolved in toluene for MIXTURE. The polymer solution, which
has a very large Soret effect, developed a strong concentration gradient in response to the applied
temperature gradient. Two publications have appeared recently describing the two experiments and the
ﬂight results, that are brieﬂy reported here [18, 19]. As a general reference to the subject of non-
equilibrium ﬂuctuation we suggest the exhaustive and beautifully written book by Ortiz de Zarate and
Sengers [20]. The present work is the ﬁrst report containing results from both MIXTURE and
SINGLE.

2. Experimental setups

Each setup consisted of a thin cylindrical sample cell with associated equipment to impose a stable

temperature difference between the plates conﬁning the sample. In both cases, the optical aXis of a

shadowgraph was oriented parallel to the gradient, and therefore optical windows that conduct heat

much better than do the samples were required. Sapphire was chosen, as it has a thermal conductivity

hundreds of times larger than that of typical ﬂuids. Because the cells are rather different, they will be
described below separately. The SINGLE cell (and associated optics) was about 3 times larger than
those of MIXTURE because the gravitationally induced crossover wave vector is about that much
larger for the mixture than for C82. For a single-component ﬂuid, qc = (agVT/(VDT ))l/4 , where a is
the thermal expansion coefﬁcient, and DT is the thermal diffusivity. Typically for single-component
organic ﬂuids, qc is of the order of 70 cm'1 as compared to a few hundred cm'1 for mixtures. As the
gravitational crossover is absent in microgravity, ﬂuctuations are limited only by the ﬁnite sample
thickness, and the cross over then occurs at a much lower value near q' C=27r/L , where L is the
sample thickness. Thus a dramatic change in the low q scattering was anticipated for MIXTURE even
with a sample thickness of only 1 mm.

Both experiments utilized the quantitative shadowgraph technique. As this method proved to
provide exceptional performance, but is very little known, we present below a brief description of the
physical principles on which it is based and the origin of the rather complex instrumental transfer
function T(q). The approach is unorthodox, no rigor will be claimed, but we hope it will be effective.
2.]. Scattering cells, Choice ofsamples, stimuli and general layout
2.1.]. SINGLE
SINGLE deals with large-scale gradient driven density ﬂuctuations in a single component liquid, C82,
which was chosen to give a large signal. The apparatus was a ﬂight version similar to the prototype
developed to demonstrate the feasibility of measuring signals from a single-component ﬂuid heated
from above, something that had not been achieved previously. A 75 -mm diameter 3 mm thick sample,
at 1 atmosphere, was conﬁned between the sapphire window and a silicon mirror. The window was
coated with transparent conducting Indium Tin OXide (ITO) on the surface in contact with the C82,
and the ITO was used to generate heat. Heat was removed from the mirror by means of 4 Peltier
elements separated from the mirror by a thermal diffuser. The ITO and Peltier currents were regulated
to impose gradients and were also used to maintain the mean temperature at 300 C. Light of
wavelength 680 nm from a super-luminous diode coupled into a mono-mode ﬁbre, was used for
illumination. The light diverged in a nearly Gaussian beam from the polished end of the ﬁbre and
passed through a beam splitter and then a lens mounted just upstream from the sample window. The
lens collimated the light into a diffraction—limited beam, after which it passed through the sample and
was reﬂected by the mirror. The beam splitter diverted 50% of the returning beam to a 1024 by 1024
CCD sensor, which recorded images at an effective distance 2 = 310 cm from the sample. By dividing
images pixel by pixel, it was possible to detect the fractional intensity variation 51(x, y,t) caused by
interference between the beam and light scattered by the ﬂuctuations. F ourier transformation of the
central 512 by 512 portion of such ratio images served to separate the ﬂuctuations by wave vector. In
the end the apparatus proved to be extremely sensitive and we were able to measure signals with
applied temperature differences as small as l K. In taking data during the mission, nominal
temperature differences of l, 2, 5, 10, 15, 20 and 30 K were applied, and the same values were used
while taking data on Earth after the mission.

2.1.2. MIXTURE

MIXTURE deals with large-scale ﬂuctuations of concentration, and to induce them, a concentration
gradient must be established. A repeatable and controlled way to do so is to utilize the Soret effect
[13]. Applying a temperature gradient generates a Soret mass ﬂow, until the gradient reaches steady
state where back diffusion balances the Soret ﬂow. The resulting steady-state concentration proﬁle is
governed by Ac 2 —STc(l — C)AT . Here ST 2 6.49 ><10_2 K'1 is the Soret coefﬁcient, and c = 1.8 wt.%
is the concentration. In contrast with the sample choice for SINGLE, sample choice for MIXTURE
offered a broad spectrum of choices, as ST varies substantially with solute molecular weight and

species. Unfortunately, the mass diffusion coefﬁcient typically scales in the opposite way, and has to
be chosen carefully in order to make time constants compatible even with a two-week mission.
Ultimately, a low molecular weight polystyrene-toluene solution was used (MW = 9,100 g mol'l), as it
guaranteed a large Soret-driven concentration gradient and reasonably large mass diffusivity DC to
keep time constants within reason. The magnitude of the concentration difference can be readily
altered, and the experiment repeated as desired. The thermal-gradient cell was a ﬁight-engineered
version of a prototype used for ground-based tests [21], and was similar to designs developed
previously [16, 17].

The sample was a 25-mm diameter by 1.00 mm thick layer of polymer solution conﬁned between
two parallel, 12 mm thick, sapphire windows that were temperature controlled to better than i 0.01 K.
The use of sapphire windows allowed the application of a relatively uniform temperature difference,
while permitting optical access to the sample in a direction parallel to the imposed gradient. The
sample was illuminated with collimated, 680 nm wavelength, light from a super-luminous LED
coupled to a mono-mode optical ﬁbre. Interference between the beam and the light scattered by the
diffusing fronts resulted in small but measurable variations of the intensity in the images collected by a
Charge-Coupled Device (CCD) with 1024x1024 square pixels. The central 512 by 512 portion of
differences of succeeding images were F ourier decomposed to reveal the mean—squared amplitude of
concentration ﬂuctuations vs. the scattering wave vector q.

A measurement cycle involved an initial equilibration phase at a uniform temperature of 30.00 C
for 260 minutes. Toward the end of this phase, a set of 539 reference images was acquired to
characterize the optical background and the camera noise. This phase was followed by the rapid
imposition of a temperature difference across the sample, which started the diffusion process. The
temperature differences utilized were 4.35, 8.70 and 17.40 K. The time required for the formation of a
linear temperature proﬁle was about 100 s. In contrast, the time to create a steady-state concentration
proﬁle (10 = h2/(7I2DC )) was about 500 s; here DC 2 1.97 ><10‘6 cmZ/s is the diffusion coefﬁcient, and
h = 1.00 mm the sample thickness.

2.2. The Shadowgraph method

The structure function of ﬂuctuations S (q) is usually determined by measuring the angular
distribution of scattered light I (q) 0C S (q) , the scattering angle (9 being related to the wave vector of
the ﬂuctuations by q =2ksin(6’/ 2), where k is the wave vector of the light in the sample. In the
simplest arrangement, sensors at various scattering angles are placed well clear of the transmitted
beam. When ﬂuctuations become spatially large, scattering angles must be reduced, and separating the
scattered light from the beam becomes exceedingly difﬁcult, as stray light scattered by imperfections
in every optical surface encountered by the beam overwhelms the true scattering. It is in this regime
that the power of light scattering Via the shadowgraph is most valuable.

A shadowgraph instrument can be used as a scattering instrument [22], where one actually exploits the
eXistence of the transmitted beam as a local oscillator that mixes with the weak scattered ﬁeld. This
mixing results in small amplitude time- and spatially-dependent ﬂuctuations in the beam intensity
which may be quantiﬁed using a digital camera. The sensor is normally so close that light scattered at
any angle of interest falls onto the detector. A special scattering condition, the Raman Nath (R-N)
condition (see below) is normally satisﬁed. Before proceeding further, one should stop for a second,
and ponder the extreme simplicity of this method: a good quality plane wave, the scattering cell, and a
sensor comprise the entire setup. Because of the interference between the beam and the scattered light,
the low contrast intensity variations are proportional to the scattered ﬁeld, rather than to the scattered
intensity. Consequently, taking the F ourier transform of the intensity distribution gives the angular
spectrum of the scattered radiation [22, 23]. So one could actually determine both the amplitude and

phase of the scattered plane waves in all directions. Indeed for a sample consisting of spheres, such as
the calibration sample discussed below, one can generate the images of individual particle Via a z scan
[24]. However, as we are interested in the scattered intensity, measuring the power spectrum of the
detected intensity distribution P(q) is more useful, rather than the overly-detailed F ourier transform.
Of course phases are lost, and positions of particles are consequently also lost. From the above naive
discussion, one might be inclined to think that P(q) oc S (q). Unfortunately, the matter is more
complicated, as a transfer function T (q) is generally involved, and P(q) = T (q)S(q) . Actually, T (q)
is the product of a number of transfer functions, each accounting for contributions due to various
phenomena, such as temporal space coherence, averaging over pixels, optical resolution and
windowing caused by taking ﬁnite-sized images, etc. Some of these effects are subtle, and will not be
discussed here. Others, like ﬁnite time coherence will be brieﬂy mentioned below.

The most evident feature of the power spectra of shadow images is the typical oscillatory, fringe-like
behaviour, that is a consequence of the Raman Nath condition. It is rather simple to calculate T (q)
due to R-N condition. By deﬁnition, it is the response to white noise signal, that is to light being
scattered uniformly as a function of q, as is the case for very small particles, that have S (q) = S (0) =
constant. The interference at distance 2 for a small particle in the origin is given by
I (x, y) 2 @00s[@ + 4 where Z is the distance and (a the scattered wave phase delay.

The assomated power spectrum is S(qx,qy)=k—2‘S(O)‘ s1n [E—gb] and 1t comeldes With the
transfer function T (q). This implies that the random intensity distribution is made up by identical,
inﬁnite, constant amplitude interference fringes. The extra phase 4/5 accounts for size dependent phase
delays, as discussed below [25]. Let us see when this holds true. As the fringe peak positions in q
depend on distance, this implies that for all the q values of interest, the actual sample thickness must
be so small that distance variations between z—L/2 and z+L/2 will not introduce appreciable
changes for the positions of the outermost fringe like oscillations. It can be easily proven that this is
the R-N condition qu / (21(0) S 7:. So, if S (q) decays over the wave vector range where R-N holds, it
will depress accordingly the inﬁnite sequence of fringe-like oscillations of T (q). So, in a sense, it is
partially true that P(q) and S(q) are proportional, but in “average” over the T (q) oscillations, the
case q=0 being pathological because of the wide minimum, that requires special attention.

In concluding, thinking in terms of circular interference fringes as the source of the power spectra
can be very proﬁtable, because one learns how to get a gross idea about additional effects like limited
time coherence of the superluminous diode that has been used in both setups. As ﬂ/A/l is typically of
the order of 40, additional depression of the fringe like oscillations should be expected at the 40th
fringe, as limited coherence adds its share in depressing the oscillations, and it must be accounted for.

While one could ﬁgure out one by one the contributions to T (q) , it was found much proﬁtable to
derive experimentally T (q) through a calibration procedure. As often done with scattering method, a
colloidal suspension was chosen. Unfortunately very small particles, say 100 nm in diameter,
otherwise ideal to guarantee uniform scattered intensity and zero scattered wave phase delay, do
scatter too little, and ﬁnally 2 micron polystyrene spheres in isopropyl alcohol were chosen.

Below, the scheme used for the mixture experiment is reported, the one for single being almost
identical. The transfer function can be quite generally written as T (q) = A(q) sin(q22/2k0)+C(q) ,
where the envelopes of the minima and maxima are equal to C(q) and A(q)+ C(q) , respectively.
Calibrating the optical system means basically to determine the functions A(q) and C (q) .

To carry out the calibration, 320 images were taken with the cell ﬁlled with ﬁltered isopropyl alcohol,
to determine a background signal S B (q). The cell was then ﬁlled with the colloidal suspension, and
3500 images were taken. Between each image, the sample was stirred using an automatic piston, to
ensure statistically independent images. After subtracting S B (q) , the signal from the spheres is given
by S Sp (q) = A(q)sin2 (q22/2k0 + ¢Sp) + C(q) , where ¢Sp is an additional phase delay that accounts for
the n0n-vanishing optical thickness of the 2 micron spheres in isopropyl alcohol [25]. We found the
phase delay to be 1.78 radians, in very good agreement with Mie theory [26]. The functions A(q) and
C(q) were determined by ﬁtting the data for 551) (q), and this in turn allowed us to determine the
instrumental transfer function T (q).

3.]. Mixture

To show the striking comparison between ground and ﬂight data, we show in Figure 1 a sequence of
false colour two dimensional shadow images taken both on ground and in ﬂight with the polymer
solution and an applied temperature difference of 17.40 degrees. Images were taken 0, 500, 1000 and
2000 s (left to right) after the imposition of a 17.40 K temperature difference. The side of each image
corresponds to 5 mm. Colours map the deviation of the intensity of shadowgraph images with respect
to the time-averaged intensity.

The ﬁgure shows that in a graVity-free environment, ﬂuctuations are boosted in amplitude and size.
Images were acquired at a constant frame rate of 0.1 Hz while a temperature gradient was kept
constant for 42 h. Estimates of the mean square amplitude of the ﬂuctuations at various q is performed
by taking the azimuthal average of the two dimensional power spectrum.

From the actual values of the fractional intensity ﬂuctuations (see false colour scale) one can derive
an absolute estimate for the rms of the phase ﬂuctuations. It amounts to less the 10'2 radians. So path
length changes of few Angstrom are actually evaluated. Similar conclusions can be immediately
reached by noticing that the scattering phase delay ¢ is very small. So the one millimetre size giant
ﬂuctuations have an optical thickness smaller than a 100 nm polystyrene colloidal particle in water [
25]. Incidentally, this also implies that the main beam fractional power removal by the ﬂuctuations is a
small fraction of 0.1 %. The proportionality of the overall amplitude of non-equilibrium ﬂuctuations to
‘VT‘Z is conﬁrmed in the bottom part of the ﬁgure 2.

Experimental data were compared With existing numerical predictions. In the absence of gravity,
and With the radius of gyration of the polymer chains much larger than the size of solvent molecules, a
theoretical model [20, 27] based on a single-mode Galerkin approximation predicts that the mean-
squared amplitude of ﬂuctuations should scale onto a universal curve independent of mixture
properties or applied concentration difference Which scales as at large wave vectors and saturates to a
constant value at small wave vectors. Figure 3 shows the experimental data plotted With the theoretical
prediction, in the absence of adjustable parameters. This result provides a straightforward conﬁrmation
of the scale invariance of the ﬂuctuations up to wavelengths comparable to the sample thickness, and
of the overall increase of amplitude of ﬂuctuations When compared to data acquired on earth (dashed
lines). Above a length scale comparable to the sample thickness, the results conﬁrm that the scale
invariance of the fronts of diffusion is frustrated by the ﬁnite size of the container, as predicted by
theory [27] and by two-dimensional simulations [28]. Quite interestingly, very recent simulations

The data are shown as open circles, and the theoretical result is shown as the solid line. It should be
emphasized that 110 parameters have been adjusted in making this comparison, including the

absolute amplitude and wave-Vector dependence. Of course, the theory actually predicts the structure

transfer function T (q) and S (q). The oscillatory behaviour associated with the transfer function is
clearly evident. Similar results were observed for all applied gradients.

SINGLE exhibited some unexpected behaviour during ﬂight, and to date we have no explanation
for what was observed, however we have devised a reasonably robust method for extracting useful
data despite the difﬁculties. Figure 5 shows shadowgraph images taken with no gradient applied (left)
and shortly after application of a nominal 30 K temperature difference across the sample (right).

Figure 5. Shadowgraph image taken during ﬂight with no temperature difference applied (left) and with a
nominal 30 K difference applied (right). Note the presence of several white spots of various intensities in
the image on the right, as well as the distortions present near the periphery. The speckled region at the
bottom is of no consequence.

We observed that applying a temperature gradient during ﬂight resulted in the sudden (within
seconds) appearance of several white spots in the image, as though light were being focused in those
regions. These bright regions appeared in exactly the same place every time a gradient was applied,
and remained ﬁxed in location as long as the gradient was maintained. Normal ﬂuctuations were
observed in those regions however. In addition to the white spots, it is evident that there are other
perturbations present in the outer portions of the cell, and these perturbations evolved slowly over the
5-hour duration of a data run, suggesting that they may have been caused by weak lateral temperature
gradients. The extent of this evolution was marked, and is shown by the two images of ﬁgure 6.

The central region from which the data were obtained seemed little affected, however, the results

what region was chosen for analysis and even from run to run. Time-domain spectral analysis of
images taken in rapid succession (as rapidly as 30 Hz) revealed that presence of an additional noise

mgm- ﬁt to the data shown as open circles, while the
__ data shown as X’s was excluded from the ﬁt. The
”m3“ G‘ Thu ‘3 ' L integral of the ﬁtted function equals T (q)S(q) .

By ﬁtting the higher frequency data using the predicted theoretical form and integrating the
resulting spectrum it was possible to extract results for the product T (q)S (q) . Examples of the time
domain power spectrum S (q,a)) for several very small wave vectors are shown in ﬁgure 7. As can be
seen, the additional noise (Visible in the data shown as X’s) is signiﬁcant only for angular frequencies
below about 0.2 rad/s (~0.03 Hz), and is thus a very low frequency phenomenon, allowing it to be
separated from the data by ﬁtting. Clearly, the form predicted by theory provides an excellent
description of the dynamics of the ﬂuctuations, as shown by the good agreement between the open
circles and the solid lines. By automating the ﬁtting process is was possible to analyze the ﬂight data
to obtain T (q)S (q) for many different q values, and the results are shown in ﬁgure 8, below.

Comparison of the vertical aXis scale With that of ﬁgure 4 shows that removing graVity has
enhanced the signal by about a factor of 8, and that the position of the lowest peak has shifted to lower
wave vector. This occurs because removing graVity eliminates the gravitational suppression of the
ﬂuctuations, and their amplitude continues to diverge as q —> 0 until limited by the ﬁnite sample
thickness of 3 mm.

To display the behaViour more generally we may divide the data by the measured transfer function
(bearing in mind that near the minima this involves dividing by small numbers!). Doing so produces
experimental results for the structure factor S (q) in absolute units, and the results are shown in ﬁgure
9 for several applied gradients, both on Earth and in the absence of graVity.

Figure 9. Data for the dimensionless structure factor S (q) obtained by dividing the raw data by the q-
dependent transfer function T (q), vs. the dimensionless wave vector qL , for applied gradients of
17.9 K/cm (squares), 34.5 K/cm (triangles) and 101 K/cm (circles). The upper curves show the data
obtained during ﬂight and the lower ones show data obtained on Earth after the mission. The solid
lines are the theoretical predictions Without any adjustable parameters. From [19]

Note that the Wide ﬁat plateau region observed on Earth is replaced by a broad maximum in the
absence of graVity. As predicted, this maximum occurs very near qL = 7r , showing that in the absence
of gravity, the only thing limiting the range and amplitude of the ﬂuctuations is the ﬁnite sample
thickness. Considering that these ﬂuctuations are thermally driven, this is certainly a remarkable
observation.
