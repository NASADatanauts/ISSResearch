We present the scientiﬁc targets, instrumental design, principle of measurement, and development of the Visible and

; near—Infrared Spectral Imager (VISI) Which will be launched onto International Space Station (183) in January 2012. VISI is
equipped with fast optics including a grisrn, and a high-sensitivity CCD to obtain airglow emissions at wavelengths of O (630
nm), 0H Meinel band (650 nm) and 02 (0-0) atmospheric band (762nm). VISI has two ﬁeld-ofuviews (FOVs), 45 degrees
forward and 45 degrees backward to nadir, to subtract background contaminations. The data acquisition of VISI will be
continuously performed With short exposure cycle less than several seconds when 188 is orbiting in the night side of the earth,

and then provide the seamless line scanning images of the airglows with a spatial resolution better than 50km. After
manufacturing VISI, we checked its performance though optical and electric function tests as well as environmental tests that are
necessary to be launched.
