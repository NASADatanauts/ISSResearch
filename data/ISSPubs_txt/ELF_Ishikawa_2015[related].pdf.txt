Abstract
The electrostatic levitation furnace (ELF) for the International Space Station (188) has been developed and sent to the 188. The main target
of the furnace are oxide samples, Which are difﬁcult to levitate in l-G. Thermophysical properties such as density, surface tension, and
Viscosity of molten oxides at high temperature will be measured using microgravity condition in the 188. In this paper, the ISS-ELF and the
ﬁrst 188 experiment (thermophysical property measurement of some oxide materials) are introduced.
