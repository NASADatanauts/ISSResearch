NASA is developing the Advanced Biological Research System (ABRS) for use in
conducting microgravity life science experiments in low-earth orbit. The ABRS Will be
added to NASA’s inventory of generic life science laboratory equipment to be used on the
International Space Station. ABRS is being designed to conduct a Wide range of biological
investigations of both short and long durations as the system is both orbiter middeck and
[SS EXPRESS rack compatible. The design possesses sufﬁcient ﬂexibility to support not only
currently planned studies of higher plants, but future, as yet unknown, investigations of
interest. This paper Will detail the design of this unique piece of spaceﬂight hardware.

1. Hardware Design
The Advanced Biological Research System (ABRS; Figure 1) is a new hardware system designed to conduct a
Wide variety of biological experiments on the International Space Station (188). ABRS ﬁts Within either a
single rear—breathing Space Shuttle middeck locker or an ISS EXPRESS Rack, and can support the growth of
plants, microbes, and/or other small specimens by providing controlled environmental conditions. It is manifested
to launch in 2009, and Will be maintained on 188 for future payloads.

ABRS is composed of several subsystems. The Advanced Payload Modular Locker (APML; Figure 2) is a
payload—generic external shell that contains the Structural Mounting Assembly (SMA), Which ties together all of the
ABRS components. The APML interfaces With both the Space Shuttle middeck and the ISS EXPRESS Rack. It
incorporates integral rear vents that allow avionics bay air to cool the payload on both orbiting platforms. The front
panel contains a hinged door that allows access to the payload’s interior, and contains an indicator light, portable ﬁre
extinguisher (PFE) access hole, and door latch. ABRS operates on orbiter or 188 supplied 28V direct current power.

An independent piece of Experiment Unique Equipment (EUE) called the Green Fluorescent Protein (GFP)
Imaging System (GIS) Will be housed Within one of ABRS’s two Experimental Research Chambers (ERCs). The
GIS provides wavelength speciﬁc Light Emitting Diode (LED) illumination and cameras for imaging GFP—
containing organisms on petri dishes.

The Control Data Monitoring System (CDMS) provides stand-alone control of ABRS, and allows crew
interaction on-orbit Via a laptop computer. A small CR2032 LiMnOz battery provides backup power to the
computer real-time clock in the event the power supply is interrupted. The CDMS provides the following functions:
(1) Data acquisition and environmental control based on real-time multitasking software; (2) Ethernet
communication between ABRS and ground-based teams through the EXPRESS Rack Interface Computer that
allows continuous data transfer, commanding, and software revision uplink as required; (3) Stand-alone control of
ABRS Via on-board experiment protocols; (4) Interface Via laptop computers With menu—driven software; (5)
Communication between CDMS and laptop Via RS-232 serial port; (6) Status LED on the front access door; (7)
Secure Digital (SD) memory cards for storage of data; (8) Allows downlink of analog Video and digital image data.
A. Operations

After launch ABRS will be transferred from the Shuttle middeck to an ISS EXPRESS Rack. The system Will be
powered down, transferred to the ISS, outﬁtted With a 280 micron inlet debris trap, physically mounted to the
EXPRESS rack, mated to the ISS Moderate Temperature Loop (MTL), and connected to the EXPRESS rack data
and power sources. Nominal ABRS operations include periodic status checks, water replenishment, ﬁlter change-
outs and experiment speciﬁc operations that can involve specimen removal for manipulations, harvest and
photography. An LED on the door provides indication of power and general operating condition (nominal green,
off-nominal amber). In the intended nominal operating mode, payload status Will be monitored and corrected by
ground controllers. In the event of off-nominal conditions during an extended loss of signal, the crew can utilize the
EXPRESS laptop to determine the exact nature of the indicated fault.

B. Environmental Research Chambers (ERCS)

ABRS contains two independently-programmable Environmental Research Chambers (ERCs; Figure 3) Whose
light regime (intensity and periodicity), temperature, relative humidity and carbon dioxide (C02) are controlled to
user speciﬁed setpoints. Each ERC contains three top-situated analog color cameras (CMOS; 640x480) that provide
coverage of the entire growth area and one power/data connector for EUE (Figure 5). Camera images are sent live
to the ground daily through the EXPRESS rack.

Each ERC provides a growing area of over 268 cm2 (13.3 X 20.2 cm). The removable base provides up to 5 cm
of depth With 19 cm of head space available from the top of the base to the top of the chamber. A rotating handle
mechanism facilitates one-handed removal/replacement 0f the base assembly. Both ERCS share a common insulated
dividing wall. Thin aluminum sheets are bonded to the internal surfaces of the ERC to provide smooth, uniform
surfaces. Thin White Teﬂon sheets are bonded to the aluminum sheets to improve biocompatibility, inhibit
microbial growth (biofouling) 0f the internal surfaces, and improve reﬂectivity of light Within the chamber.

Each ERC has its own independent Environmental Control Panel (ECP; Figures 3, 4) that provides control of
temperature and relative humidity, and contains components of the condensate collection assembly. The ECP
includes the ERC’s cold sink, circulation blowers, condensate collection assembly, heater, and sensors. A pair of
external Cooling Units cools water delivered to the ECP cold sink using thermo—electric coolers (TECS).
Condensate is stored and managed on the pump panel, and can be recycled to the ERC bases. During ISS operation,
the MTL lines receive and return water from the EXPRESS Rack MTL, and route it through the Cooling Units to
provide heat exchange With the water 100p circulated through the ECP.

The LED Light Module (LLM; Figure 5) provides light speciﬁcally conﬁgured for plant growth. The LED
Arrays are made up of 606 LEDs (303 per side) arranged in banks to allow for Pulse Width Modulation control of
light intensity. There are two independent LED banks (one for each ERC), both contained on a single printed circuit
board. A mixture of ultra bright red, White, green and blue LEDs produce a spectrum With primary peaks at 470 and

C. Atmospheric Control
ABRS is designed With two independently controlled Air Filtration Systems (AFS), one for each ERC side,
providing the capability to maintain different C02 set points and low volatile organic compound (VOC) levels
(including ethylene) in each chamber. Each AFS is composed of a ﬁltration module containing chemical
adsorbents, an air source manifold an air routing manifold, one solenoid valve, a small diaphragm pump and a mass
ﬂow sensor. The Air Routing Manifold directs air through the solenoid valve to one of two paths Within the
ﬁltration module. If the C02 level needs to be reduced, airﬂow is routed to a bed of LiOH (229 cm3 or about 101g)
Within the Filtration Module Where C02 is scrubbed from the atmosphere. If the C02 level is to be maintained, then
the airﬂow is directed to a bed of Puraﬁl® or potassium permanganate (KMnO4) on alumina (135 cm3 or about 90
g), Where VOCs are removed. Except for the air ﬁltration module, the AFS components associated With each ERC
subvolume are co-located on the respective ERC pump panel for that chamber (Figures 3, 4). Both air ﬁltration
modules are mounted to the back of the front panel access door (Figure l) to facilitate crew change-out as required.
C02 level is monitored by a sensor located in the ECP Within each ERC. A third sensor monitors the C02 level of
the ambient APML environment as supplied by either the EXPRESS Avionics Air Assembly or the middeck rear
avionics cooling duct. The Air Source Manifold pulls air into the manifold either from the interior of the ERC or
from the ambient environment within the APML (Via a solenoid valve) using a diaphragm pump. Ambient air is
only required if the carbon dioxide concentration Within the ERC is below setpoint (since atmospheric C02
concentration in spacecraft is generally higher than the desired setpoint for biological experiments). For most
applications it is anticipated that change-outs of fresh AFS modules Will occur every 15-20 days during the mission
to prevent loss of desired setpoints. This procedure requires initiation Via the laptop interface, opening the ABRS
access hatch, removing expired ﬁltration modules, and replacement With new modules.
D. Temperature Control
ABRS contains a payload forced-air cooling circulation blower (Whose inlet is covered With a 280 micron
stainless steel screen When installed in the EXPRESS rack) and an air distribution plenum. The screen is not
installed While in the space shuttle middeck in order to facilitate greater air ﬂow during the ‘rear-breathing only’

"8","ascent phase. The blower pulls air in through either the EXPRESS rack Avionics Air Assembly 0r middeck rear
avionics bay, and forces air through the APML rear inlet vents and into the ABRS air distribution plenum, Where it
is directed to the LLM, through heat sinks 0n the twin cooling units, over the printed circuit assemblies (PCAs)
located Within the ECU, and out through APML rear outlet vents. Four blowers run continuously to circulate air
through the ECP and provide a uniform atmosphere Within the volume of the ERC.

Figure 9. MTL Lines (Cooling Units not shown).

Temperature control Within the ERCs is achieved by two independently controlled Cooling Units (Figure 3)
located external to the ERCs. They use four thermoelectric coolers (TECs) that are centrally clamped through the
Cold Side Heat Exchanger to promote good contact With the heat sinks. The heat sinks consist of machined
aluminum heat rejection ﬁns With stainless steel tubes imbedded Within that allow ISS MTL water to be used for
cooling (Figure 9). Three fans located on each Cooling Unit assist in circulating the avionics air through the
aluminum ﬁns. Water Within the Cold Side Heat Exchanger is chilled by contact With the cold side of the TECs. A
magnetically driven spherical motor pump circulates 75 m1 of chilled double—distilled water through this Cold Side
Heat Exchanger and into the Cold Sink located on the ECP Within each chamber.

During EXPRESS rack operation, water from the MTL is split between each ERC side and routed to the back of
each of the two Cooling Units. During middeck operation, 36 cﬁn 0f avionics air is directed into the Cooling Units,
and across the aluminum ﬁns to rej ect the generated heat.

E. Relative Humidity and Water Control

The same ECP cold sink used to control air temperature is used for relative humidity control. The temperature
of the ECP cold sink is dependent on the TEC heat removal and the volume of airﬂow across it. Airﬂow can be
adjusted by reducing blower speed of the ECP circulation blowers thereby promoting condensation. A heater
designed into the ECP can be energized if needed to increase the air temperature When dehumidiﬁcation results in
excessive cooling. When the ECP cold sink temperature is below the dew point, water vapor is removed from the

8
American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics

"
"9","air and condensation occurs. The four ECP circulation blowers drive the water down the surface of the hydrophilic
ECP cold sink Where it is captured by the condensate collection assembly, Which consists of a polyethylene porous
tube embedded Within a trapezoidal polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) sponge that has excellent absorption and is resistant to
fungal growth. A peristaltic pump maintains a slight negative pressure in the porous tube utilizing a pressure sensor
resulting in removal of water from the PVA sponge. The pump has reversible ﬂow capability so that it can be used
to prime 0r re-priIne the porous tube and sponge. A bubble detector monitors the ﬂuid from the porous tube to
detect air before it passes to the ﬂexible reservoir bag (llOilO mL) for reintroduction into the system. Each
reservoir is contained inside a polycarbonate box for support and liquid containment in the event of a bag failure.
This box includes a Tyvek® seIni-penneable membrane enabling the box to breathe as the reservoir ﬁlls and
empties nominally. When the reservoir is sensed to be full Via an in-line pressure sensor, it’s contents can be
pumped back into the ERC base. Although the ERCs are sealed, atmospheric leakage t0 the cabin is anticipated
over time. Consequently, periodically these reservoirs can be reﬁlled for those applications requiring water resupply
(e.g., plant growth).

F. GFP Imaging System (GIS)

The GIS has been designed for imaging organisms that have been modiﬁed to include Green Fluorescent Protein
(GFP) reporter genes. The imager occupies one ERC. Major subcomponents include the base, camera housing,
petri plate racks, and power/data pigtail (Figure 11). Each rack is capable of holding two 95 X 95 mm square petri
plates. Leaf springs apply pressure to the sides of the plates to keep them stationary in the racks. A spring plunger
at the top of each rack stops plates from lifting up and out of the racks. Five of the plate positions provide growing
or storage locations for their associated plates. Cutouts in the racks permit light from the ABRS LLM to enter these
dishes from both sides. The rack located opposite the camera housing includes one plate position With a solid back.
This is the plate position that is imaged by the GFP camera.

The Camera Housing completely encloses an LED PCA (populated With 140 blue LEDs; 470 i2 nm), a
separate camera PCA, a glass camera lens, and a glass bandpass ﬁlter. The blue LED light bank, used to provide the
9

"10","excitation energy required to View GFP, is switched on only When capturing images. The bandpass ﬁlter is covered
by a piece of clear polycarbonate that completes the enclosed box. The camera lens and insert protrude through and
seal a large central hole in the clear polycarbonate bandpass ﬁlter cover. This small, 1/2 inch glass lens is securely
ﬁxed into the lens element assembly With optical glue. The camera itself consists of a 5.1 megapixel
Complementary Metal Oxide Semiconductor (CMOS) sensor. There are two slots that accept removable SD
memory cards. A Power Pigtail transfers power and data between the ABRS EUE connector located in the rear
frame of the ERC and the power PCA 0n the GIS. .

Figure 11. Left: ABRS GFP Imaging System (GIS). Right: Petri Dish Rack.

Frequency of GFP imaging sessions are programmable. During each image capture, the ABRS LLM ambient
lighting LEDs are shut off and the GIS LEDs powered on all Within a fraction of one second. Light from the GIS
LEDs passes through the bandpass ﬁlter to strike the petri plate target positioned across the chamber. Organisms
expressing the GFP gene radiate green light in response to this excitation. The camera captures this green image and
saves it to the SD cards (each capable of holding 500 images). The GIS LEDs are then shut off and the ABRS LLM
lights are turned back 011. A second, reference image of the organisms under nominal illumination is then captured
by the GIS camera and saved for comparison With the GFP image. Selected images can be downlinked t0 the
ground daily for evaluation, but all imaging sessions are captured by the SD cards. Upon conclusion of an
experimental run, the SD cards are removed and returned to the ground.

11. Conclusions

The ABRS hardware system Will provide current and future investigators conducting research in the space life
science arena a valuable tool for many years to come. The ABRS system Will successfully operate Within the
constraints imposed by both the shuttle middeck and 188 While providing researchers a means of conducting tightly
controlled, repeatable experiments.
