Abstract
The loss of bone and muscle is a major concern for long duration space ﬂight. In December of 1989, we established a
collaboration with Russian colleagues to determine the bone and lean tissue changes in cosmonauts before and after ﬂights
on the Mir space station lasting 4-14.4 months. Eighteen crew members received a lumbar spine and hip DEXA scan (Hologic
1000W) before and after ﬂight; 17 crew members received an additional whole body scan. All results were expressed as percent
change from baseline per month of ﬂight in order to account for the different ﬂight times. The pre-and post-ﬂight data were
analyzed using Hotelling’s T2 for 3 groups of variables: spine, neck of femur, trochanter; whole body BMD and subregions;
lean (total, legs, arms) and fat (total only). A paired t-test was used as a follow-up to the Hotelling’s T2 to identify the individual
measurements that were significantly different. These data define the rate and extent of bone and lean tissue loss during long
duration space ﬂight and indicate that the current in-ﬂight exercise program is not sufficient to completely ameliorate bone
and muscle loss during weightlessness.
