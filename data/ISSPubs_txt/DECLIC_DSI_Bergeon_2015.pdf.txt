Abstract : To clarify and characterize the fundamental physical mechanisms active in the
dynamical formation of three—dimensional (3D) arrays of cells and dendrites under diffusive growth
conditions, in situ monitoring of series of experiments on transparent model alloy succinonitrile —
0.24 wt% camphor was carried out under low gravity in the DECLIC Directional Solidiﬁcation
Insert on—board the International Space Station. These experiments offered the very unique
opportunity to in situ observe and characterize the whole development of the microstructure in
extended 3D patterns. The experimental methods will be ﬁrst brieﬂy described, including in
particular the observation modes and the image analysis procedures developed to quantitatively
characterize the patterns. Microgravity environment provided the conditions to get quantitative
benchmark data: homogeneous patterns corresponding to homogeneous values of control
parameters along the whole interface were obtained. The sequence of microstructure formation will
be presented as well as the evolution of the primary spacing which is one of the most important
pattern characteristic. Time evolution of this primary spacing during the microstructure
development will be analysed to identify the mechanisms of spacing selection and adjustment; the
importance of the macroscopic interfacial curvature will be pointed out.
1. Introduction
The study of solidification microstructure formation and selection is very important in the engineering and
processing of advanced new materials [1]. The interface patterns formed by solidification largely govern
mechanical and physical properties of materials. The two most typical microstructures are cells and
dendrites, and their characteristics profoundly inﬂuence the properties of a wide range of commercial
metallic alloys. The correlation between microstructure and processing conditions can be best examined
by directional solidification experiments in which all parameters can be accurately and independently
controlled.

The evolution of the spatial pattern of cells or dendrites occurs under dynamic conditions of growth in
which the forming pattern reorganizes into a rather periodic array so that in situ and real time observation
of the solid—liquid interface is a precious tool to get a detailed knowledge of the entire time—evolution of

the interface pattern. This explains the extensive use of transparent organic analogs that behave like
metallic alloys regarding solidification but are transparent to Visible light so that classical optical
techniques are sufficient for their observation [2].

A major impediment in the study of three—dimensional pattern evolution in ground—based experiments
is the strong inﬂuence of convection on cellular and dendritic patterns. Extensive ground—based studies
carried out in metallic and organic bulk samples have clearly established that ﬂuid ﬂow modifies the
structure of the solute boundary layer that influences the pattern development [3,4]. Directional
solidification experiments under low gravity conditions provide a unique setting to investigate
microstructure development in spatially extended sample geometries with negligible convection and under
well—controlled conditions of growth rate, temperature gradient and alloy composition. Consequently,
those experiments provide unique benchmark data to validate the predictions of theoretical and
computational models in a purely diffusive growth regime. The study presented here was thus conducted
using the Directional Solidification Insert (DSI) dedicated to in situ and real time characterization of the
dynamical selection of the solid—liquid interface morphology in bulk samples of transparent materials,
which was developed by the French Space Agency (CNES) in the frame of the DECLIC project
(Dispositif pour l'Etude de la Croissance et des LIquides Critiques). The DECLIC facility of CNES was
launched with 17—A shuttle ﬂight (August 2009) as part of a joint NASA/CNES research program and is
installed on the International Space Station in microgravity environment. The main instrument monitoring
is performed from the CADMOS center, the French User Support and Operation Centre (USOC) in
Toulouse. Taking advantage of provided tele—science capabilities, scientists have the possibility to follow
in near real—time conditions and to remotely control experiments. The commissioning of the D81 was
realized in December 2009 and siX runs of two to three weeks each were performed from April 2010 to
April 2011. The DSI was then brought back on ground and two runs of two weeks have been performed at
the CNES center with similar control parameters than experiments in pt g so that convection inﬂuence
could be addressed.

After a brief description of the experimental procedure and methods of analysis of images, results will
be described and discussed in terms of pattern formation and evolution.

2. Experimental procedure
The DECLIC—DSI insert mainly contains 2 elements: the Bridgman furnace and the experimental cartridge.
Complete descriptions of DECLIC and its inserts can be found in [5—6].

The experimental cartridge includes the quartz crucible and a system of volume compensation made of
stainless steel that is useful to accommodate the specimen volume variations associated to phase changes.
The cylindrical crucible has an inner diameter of ten millimeters and a length that enables about ten
centimeters solidification, thus allowing the study of the whole development of extended 3D patterns from
the initial stage to the steady state. The crucible is equipped with a flat glass window at the bottom and a
lens immersed in the melt at the top. The main observation mode (Axial observation) takes advantage of
the complete aXial transparency of the cartridge provided by these last two elements: the light coming
from LEDs passes through the cartridge from the bottom to the top, therefore crossing the interface. The
optical imaging system formed by the immersed lens and a following relay lens forms the image of the
interface on a CCD camera. On the same cartridge aXis, an interferometer is also set but it will not be
detailed here (more information on its use can be found in [7]). The interface can also be observed from
the side (Transverse observation).

In this study, we used a Succinonitrile (SCN) — 0.24 wt% Camphor alloy. In order to fill the crucible,
SCN purified by NASA by both distillation and zone melting was used. The alloy was then prepared by
adding the solute. All procedures for sample preparation were carefully realized under vacuum to avoid
humidity contamination. Once sealed, the cartridge was inserted inside the Bridgman furnace.

A thermal gradient ranging from 10 to 30 Kem‘1 is imposed by regulated hot and cold zones,
respectively, located above and below the adiabatic area where the interface is positioned. Upward
solidification is achieved by pulling the crucible down into the cold zone of the furnace at a rate ranging
from 0.1 to 30 ym/s. For a defined alloy concentration, varying the thermal gradient or more conveniently,
the pulling rate, leads to the development of various interface morphologies, ranging from planar front
(high gradient — low pulling rate) to cellular and finally dendritic pattern (low gradient — high pulling rate).
In the experiments detailed here, the thermal gradient is set to 19 K/crn and pulling velocities range from
0.5 to 12yrn/s.
3.Analysis methods
In situ and continuous observation leads to a huge amount of images so that adequate and as systematic as
possible procedures had to be developed and validated to extract relevant quantitative data. Quantitative
characterization of the patterns consists in measuring the evolution, as a function of time and growth
parameters, of the parameters that describe the interface morphology, such as the primary spacing,
order/disorder level of pattern, 3D—shape and the tip radius. Concerning shape of structures and tip radius,
measurements are based on interferometric analysis that is not described here. For more information on
shape reconstruction by interferometric analysis in DECLIC—DSI, one may refer to Bergeon et al. [7].

Image treatment and analysis procedures have been developed on Visilog® Image Analysis Software
(Noesis, France) to facilitate exploitation of results. The first step is to obtain a binary image that is then
used as an input for specific procedures dedicated to the determination of the primary spacing distribution
and the characterization of the pattern order/disorder and type (Minimal Spanning Tree analysis [8,9] and
number of first neighbors [9]). A more detailed description of these procedures is given in [9]. In this
article, analyses are limited to characterization of primary spacing evolution. Primary spacing can be
considered as the centre to centre distance between two neighboring cells. Its determination requires
beforehand cell detection and identification. Each cell center is then determined together With the
identification of the first neighbors so that center to center distances can be calculated. The spacing
histogram is then drawn to determine the average spacing and the standard deviation, the minimal and
maximal limits.

4. Results

Figure 1 illustrates the microstructures obtained for pulling rates ranging from 0.5 ym/s to 12 ym/s. In all
cases, the pictures correspond to the interface microstructure after about 40 mm of growth. The
microstructure is cellular With large spacing at low pulling rate, for example at 0.5 ym/s (figure 1(a)) 0r 2
ym/s (figure1(b)) and the deep cells observed at 4 [4111/8 (figure 1(0)) become dendritic (sharpening 0f the
tips, anisotropy of the tip shape) at 8 ym/s as observed on the zooms of figure 1(d) and 1(e). The spacing
decreases when the pulling rate increases and this decrease is faster at low pulling rates.

The initial stages of microstructure formation are similar regardless the pulling rate. They are here
described on the basis of the experiment at VP = 4 ym/s. The starting interface corresponds to VP = 0
(figure 2(a)). After triggering of the pulling, morphological instability initiates by forming linear ridges
along sub—boundaries that finally underline a rather complex array (figure2(b)). Between these defects, in
interface areas that are still smooth, sorne poxes may be present: they can be described as circular
undulations 0f the interface. Ridges underlining sub—grain boundaries progressively emit new ridges in
their transverse direction and simultaneously, a uniform corrugation that corresponds to the initial Visible
wavelength of morphological instability invades the interface (figure 2(0)). The amplitude of all these
interface modulations starts to increase, channels are forming but it is still difficult to identify cells (figure
2(d)). At this stage, the interface dynamics is extremely fast and pattern disorder high. There is then a

progressive decrease of disorder and a clear pattern of cells eventually emerges (fig. 2(e)). The dynamics
then slows down and is limited to progressive size adjustment and array ordering (figure 2(f)).

The evolution of spacing was measured as a function of time for each pulling rate. Two examples of
such data are given in figure 3 with the spacing variation as a function of solidified length (namely the
“pulling length” = Vpxt), for VP = 0.5 ym/s and VP = 4 ym/s. At the very beginning of microstructure
formation, it is not possible to determine the spacing with center—to—center methods as microstructure does
not form distinct cells (images 2(0) and 2(d) for example). Therefore the three first measurements are
performed using a FFT (Fast Fourier Transform) based method. At low pulling velocity (for example 0.5
ym/s), the spacing progressively increases to reach its steady—state value. At higher velocity (for example
4 ym/s), the spacing displays an overgrowth of cells at the beginning of solidification before a slow
decrease to reach a steady—state value; this dynamics is consistent with previous observations on thin
samples of succinonitrile—based alloys, for example by Seetharaman et a1. [10].

Classically, two mechanisms are considered that adjust the spacing. To increase the spacing, smallest
cells slightly slow down and are finally eliminated by overgrowth by their neighbours so that the number
of cells decreases: “elimination” in fig. 4a. T0 decrease the spacing, the largest cells split into two
daughter cells so that the number of cells increases: “tip—splitting” in fig. 4b. Even if these two
mechanisms have been observed in our experiments, detailed analyses revealed that their occurrence is not
spatially homogeneous and additional phenomena have to be taken into account. Let us focus for example
on the pulling velocities 0.5 and 4 ym/s.

For VP = 0.5 ym/s, the interface is macroscopically convex (fig. 5a). This curvature induces a glide of
cells along the interface slope from the center towards the border, as for example observed in thin samples
by Bottin—Rousseau et a1. [11] for experiments with curvature purposely induced. During this gliding, cell
size increases so that cells eventually split and the number of cells increases; inversely, the gliding drives
the cells towards the border where they disappear and the number of cells decreases. The average steady—
state spacing results from the permanent balance between these two phenomena. Homogeneous
elimination is not the process for spacing adjustment whereas the spacing increases to reach its steady—
state value.

For VP =4 ym/s, the interface is macroscopically concave (fig. 5b). This curvature induces a glide of
cells along the interface slope from the border towards the centre. As it was previously described by Weiss
et a1. [12] for ground experiments in the same cylindrical geometry, cells are then generated at the border
(“source”). During their gliding, their size tends to decrease so that elimination process occurs. In our case,
it appeared that even if the gliding is mainly radial, elimination mainly occurs along sub—boundaries that
are present in this experiment. The average steady—state spacing results from the permanent balance
between the source of cells at the border and the sink along the sub—boundaries. Homogeneous tip—splitting
is not the process for spacing adjustment whereas the spacing decreases to reach its steady—state value.

5. Conclusion

In this article, we presented some results obtained in microgravity using the Directional Solidification
Insert 0f the DECLIC facility on board 188. The quality of the experimental system that provides very
clear images of the interfacial microstructure during its whole evolution has been demonstrated.
Microgravity environment provided the conditions to get quantitative benchmark data: homogeneous
patterns corresponding to homogeneous values of control parameters along the whole interface were
obtained. Long solidifications have been performed to get the whole dynamics and mechanisms of
microstructure formation or change, spacing adjustment, pattern ordering. The analyses of mechanisms of
spacing adjustment reveal a critical inﬂuence of the macroscopic interfacial curvature that induces pattern
gliding. The dynamical coupling between the evolution of the macroscopic curvature of the front and the
spacing adjustment has been shown theoretically to have an important effect on the stability limit of both
cellular [13] and eutectic [14] patterns formed during directional solidification. However, how this
coupling affects spacing selection in a situation where the front curvature is maintained by a radial
component of the temperature gradient remains poorly understood theoretically. Phase—field simulations of
the present experiments that address this question are currently underway.
