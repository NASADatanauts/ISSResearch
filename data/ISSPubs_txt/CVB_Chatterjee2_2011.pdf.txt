ARTICLE INFO ABSTRACT
Available online 21 March 2011 Using the disjoining pressure concept in a seminal paper, Derjaguin, Nerpin and Churaev demonstrated that
— isothermal liquid ﬂow in a very thin ﬁlm on the walls of a capillary tube enhances the rate of evaporation of
IQXWQWS! moisture by several times. The objective of this review is to present the evolution of the use of Churaev's
