Abstract
Spaceﬂight conditions have a signiﬁcant impact on a number of physiological functions due to
psychological stress, radiation and reduced gravity. To explore the effect of the ﬂight
environment 011 immunity, C57BL/6NTac mice were ﬂown on a 13-day space shuttle mission
(STS-118). In response to ﬂight, animals had a reduction in liver, spleen and thymus masses
compared to ground (GRD) controls (p<0.005). Splenie lymphocytes, monocyte/macrophages
and granulocyte counts were significantly reduced in the ﬂight (FLT) mice (p<0.05). Although
spontaneous blastogenesis 0f splenocytes in FLT mice was increased, response to
lipopolysaccharide (LPS), a B cell mitogen derived from E. coli, was decreased compared to
GRD mice (p<0.05). Secretion of IL-6 and IL-10, but not that of TNF-Ot by LPS-stimulated
splenoeytes was increased in FLT mice (p<0.05). Finally, many of the genes responsible for
scavenging ROS were up—regulated after ﬂight. These data indicate that exposure to the
spaceﬂight environment can increase anti-inﬂammatory mechanisms and change the ex vivo
response to lipopolysaccharide (LPS), a bacterial product associated with septic shock and a
prominent Th1 response.
Key words: Immunity, eytokines, stress, spaceﬂight, microgravity.

Since the ﬁrst human ﬂights to space, there has been a focus on the health effects of
spaceﬂight-related environmental stressors such as isolation, nutrition, microgravity, radiation
and changes in the circadian rhythm (30, 63). Studies have shown that the spaceﬂight
environment can impact several physiological systems potentially resulting in serious
consequences for immunity. As more astronauts travel to and occupy the International Space
Station, and With future interplanetary exploration and space tourism 0n the rise, the
physiological effects of spaceﬂight environment Will necessarily receive greater attention.

In vivo ﬂight studies performed in rat models have shown changes in mass (5, 22, 40) as
well as hypoplasia (11) in both the spleen and thymus. Rats ﬂown on both the COSMOS and
space shuttle platforms have shown decreases in peripheral leukocyte and lymphocyte counts (1).
Functionally, exposure to the spaceﬂight environment has resulted in decreases in the
proliferative responses of lymphocytes isolated from lymph nodes (44) and spleen (23). Other
studies have shown changes in cell mediated immunity (69), cytokine production (8, 18, 35, 62),
signal transduction (6), and natural killer cell activity (29). Furthermore, these ﬁndings are not
limited to animal models. Blood collected from astronauts selected from 11 0f the ﬁrst 12 US
space shuttle missions indicate that the spaceﬂight environment leads to decrements in both the
numbers of circulating leukocytes as well as in the proliferative response to mitogenic challenge
With phytohemagglutinin (FHA) (70).

While these studies have been critical in understanding the effects of spaceﬂight,
many of the results have been inconsistent due to differences in genetic backgrounds, mission
duration, degrees of environmental stress, housing conditions, and ambient C02 levels (19).
The results presented here are from the second of two space shuttle experiments using
identical animal models and housing conditions With similar ﬂight durations. Data from our
previous space shuttle experiment (STS-108) showed decreases in both body mass and spleen

3

"
"4","mass of ﬂight animals. Although there were no changes in blood WBC counts, decreases in 4
monocyte and granulocyte percentages in ﬂight mice were observed. The spleen of ﬂight
mice had an increase in B cells a decrease in T cells which secreted lower levels of IFN—y,
IL-1 and IL-4 when stimulated with FHA (19, 48). Results from this study will 1) verify the
reproducibility of spaceﬂight results using similar models and analyses, 2) establish a
baseline allowing future investigators to take advantage of transgenic mouse models, and 3)
expand on our previous ﬁndings by exploring gene expression patterns related to oxidative
stress and reactive oxygen metabolism.

C57BL/6 mice were ﬂown on the Space Shuttle Endeavor (STS-118) in August of 2007
on a 13-day mission. The primary aim of the study was to examine the effectiveness of an
experimental therapeutic agent by biotechnology company Amgen (Thousand Oaks, CA), as a
countermeasure to the muscle atrophy known to be associated with spaceﬂight. However, as part
of a tissue-sharing program, organized through BioServe Space Technologies at the University
of Colorado at Boulder, we were able to obtain samples for investigating changes in immune
parameters.

To date, there have only been two shuttle ﬂights that have characterized immune
parameters in a mouse model. A common criticism of spaceﬂight research is the lack of
opportunity to replicate experiments. However, through the generosity of Amgen and BioServe,
we were not only able to repeat the experiment, but expand on the previous ﬁndings. Results
from our bone marrow and T cell analyses have been published previously (21, 46). This
manuscript focuses on changes in splenio leukocyte population distributions, expression of liver
genes responsible for maintaining redox balance, and ex vivo mitogen-induoed proliferation and
cytokine secretion. These were important experiments because previous studies reported that
microgravity episodes and space shuttle ﬂight can affect oxidative bursts and protein kinase C
activation (14, 74) and that we have seen changes in spleen cell subpopulations in both rats and

4

"
"5","mice in response to space ﬂight (20, 21, 47, 49). These current experiments explored some of 5
the underlying causes for these changes. The gene expression and LPS-indueed cytokine
expression data presented here are novel observations that establish a new data set on
transcriptional activation in response to space ﬂight.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Animals and housing. Female C57BL/6 mice were ordered from Taeonic Laboratories (Hudson,
NY) and were delivered to the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) Space
Life Sciences Laboratory (SLSL) at Kennedy Space Center at 7 weeks of age and adapted to the
facility and experiment cage conditions. Female mice were used as they are less aggressive and
have been used in previous space-ﬂight studies (48). However, it is important to note that the
estrous cycle was not characterized in this study. At 9 weeks old, mice were assigned to
experimental groups by matching total body mass and lean-body mass. Twenty-four ﬂight (FLT)
and 24 ground control mice were housed in animal enclosure module (AEM) hardware equipped
with solid food bars and a water dispenser. An additional 12 control mice were housed in
standard Vivarium (VIV) conditions. Using telemetry from the shuttle, the AEM-housed ground
controls were exposed to environmental conditions comparable to ﬂight animals (i.e.
temperature, humidity, C02) 011 a 48-hour delay. The mice were treated once with placebo or
therapeutic agent approximately 24 hours prior to launch (N=12 mice per group). Only placebo
treated mice were used for immunological assessments. The FLT groups were ﬂown in Space
Shuttle Endeavor (STS-118) for 13 days. Within 3-6 hours after landing of the space shuttle,
FLT and GRD mice were evaluated for muscle strength and scanned with nuclear magnetic
resonance (NMR) imaging to assess lean and fat mass composition. Mice were then euthanized
with 100% C02 (51). This animal study was approved by Loma Linda University, NASA,
University of Colorado and Amgen IACUCs.

Specimen collection. At euthanasia, spleen, liver and thymus were harvested and weighed. A
quarter of the spleen was used to obtain leukocyte numbers at the SLSL. The rest of the spleen
was shipped on wet ice Via overnight courier t0 Loma Linda University in screw cap tubes
containing RPMI 1640 (Cellgro, Mediateeh Inc. Herndon, VA) supplemented with 20% fetal
bovine serum (FBS) (ATCC, Manassas, VA). The other organs were placed in sterile eryovials,
snap frozen in liquid nitrogen, placed on dry ice and shipped to Loma Linda University.
Leukocyte numbers in spleen. At the SLSL, single celled suspension of splenoeytes was
obtained by grinding 14 0f the spleen in a 5 mL test tube with sterile wood sticks in 2 mL of
RPMI 1640 supplemented with 10% FBS, and passing it through a 40 um nylon mesh. The tube
was washed with an additional 1 mL of RPMI 1640. Splenoeytes were then washed, centrifuged
at 300 g, and resuspended in 1 mL of RPMI 1640. Cells were then counted with the ABC Vet
Hematology Analyzer (Heska Corp, Waukesha, WI). Overall white blood cell (WBC),
lymphocyte, monocyte/maerophage and granulocyte counts and percentages were obtained from
the analyzer. Total counts were calculated based on mass using the following formula: Total
count = (Automated count / Mass of 14 spleen) X mass of whole spleen.
Spontaneous and mitogen-induced blastogenesis. Upon arrival at Lorna Linda University, single
cell suspensions of splenoeytes were obtained following the method described above. After the
first wash, erythrocytes were lysed in 2 mL of lysing buffer containing 5 mM potassium
bicarbonate, 77 111M ammonium chloride and 49 “M EDTA, at 4°C for 10 minutes. The lysing
reaction was terminated by adding 2 mL of RPMI 1640. Cells were then centrifuged, washed
twice and resuspended in 1mL 0f RPMI 1640.

"7","For spontaneous blastogenesis, 50 ttL of cells were dispensed into ﬂat—bottom, 96-well 7
mieroculture plates in triplicates. One hundred-ﬁfty ttL RPMI 1640 supplemented with 10% FBS
and 50 ttL of [3H] thymidine [3H] TdR (speciﬁc activity = 50 Ci/mmol; ICN Radioehemicals,
Irvine, CA) were added to the cells and the plates were incubated for 4 hours at 370C. Readings
were later normalized to 2 X 106 eells/mL based on the original cell counts.

For mitogen-induced blastogenesis in the spleen, cells were adjusted to 2 X 106 cells/mL
and 100 ttL aliquots were plated in triplicates into wells of 96-well ﬂat bottom mieroculture
plates. One hundred ttL of 3.3 X 10'3 mg lipopolysaccharide (LPS) (Sigma Chemical, St. Louis,
M0) were added in triplicate; control wells with 110 mitogens were included. Fifty ttL 0f
[3H]TdR (specific activity = 50 Ci/mmol) was added to each well during the last 4 hours of a 48-
hour incubation at 370C.

For both assays, cells were collected with a multiple sample harvester (Harvester 96
Mack III-m; Tomtee, Hamden CT), and the incorporated radioactivity was quantified on a 1450
Microbeta Trilux Liquid Scintillation and Luminescence Counter (EG&G-Wallac, Turku,
Finland). Stimulation index (SI) for the mitogen was calculated as follows: SI = [counts per
minute (0pm) with mitogen — epm without mitogen] / (0pm without mitogen).

LPS—induced cytokine secretion. Spleen leukocytes were diluted with RPMI 1640 supplemented

with 10% FBS and adjusted to 2 X 106 eells/mL. One hundred ttL aliquots were plated into 96-

well, ﬂat-bottorn mieroculture plates and 100 ttL of 3.3 X 10'3 mg LPS was immediately added

to each well. Cells were incubated at 37°C for 48 hours. Supernatants were aspirated and

centrifuged to remove debris. Levels of interleukin-lB (IL-IB), IL-6, IL-10, IL-12 and tumor

necrosis factor-oc (TNF-Oc) were quantiﬁed using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISA)

appropriate dilutions.
RNA puriﬁcation. Frozen liver tissue was pulverized into a powder in a mortar and pestle
submerged in liquid nitrogen. RNA was extracted using Trizol (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA).
Following incubation of homogenized samples at room temperature for 5 minutes, 0.2 mL of
chloroform was added and samples were incubated for 3 minutes. This mixture was then
centrifuged at 12,000 g for 15 minutes at 40C. Isopropyl alcohol (0.5 mL) was added to the
aqueous phase in a sterile RNase-free tube and samples were incubated at room temperature for
10 minutes, prior to centrifugation at 12,000 g for 15 minutes at 40C. The pellet was washed with
1 mL of 70% ethanol and re-centrifuged at 7,500 g for 5 minutes at 40C. Ethanol was removed
with a pipette and the pellet was allowed to air dry for 5 minutes. Pellet was dissolved in 50 ttL
0f nuclease-free water. The RNA was further puriﬁed using an RNeasy RNA puriﬁcation kit
(Qiagen) following the manufacturer’s instructions.
RNA Microarrays. RNA quality was assessed using the Agilent 2100 Bioanalyzer (Santa Clara,
CA). The integrity of the RNA was determined by looking at 18 and 28s rRNA peaks and by
RIN (RNA integrity number). RNA concentrations were measured using the nano drop and all
samples had 260/280 ratios above 2.0 and 260/230 ratios above 1.7. An equal amount of RNA (1
mg) was taken for all samples and reverse transcription was done using RT2 First Strand Kit
(SuperArray Bioseienees, Frederick, MD). Polymerase chain reactions (PCR) were performed to
evaluate expression of 84 genes using RT2 profilerTM PCR array PAMM-065 (Mouse Oxidative
Stress and Antioxidant Defense, SuperArray) 0n the ABI Fast 7900 using RT2 Real-TimeTM
SYBR Green PCR Master Mix PA-011. Thermoeycler parameters were 95°C for 10 minutes,
followed by 40 cycles of 950C for 15 s and 600C for 1 minute. Relative changes in gene
expression were calculated using the DDCt (threshold cycle) method. This method ﬁrst subtracts
8

"9","the ct(thresh01d cycle number) of the gene-average ct 0f the 3 house keeping genes on the array9
(HPRTI, GAPDH, and ACTB) to normalize t0 the RNA amount. Finally the DDCt was
calculated: normalized average ct 0f the FLT group — normalized average ct 0f GRD group. This
DDCt was raised to the power of 2 in order to calculate the fold change. The genes of interest
included those involved in oxidative stress. Six mice per group were used for this analysis.
Statistical analysis. The data were evaluated by using Student’s ttest (Systat, Systat Software,
Richmond, CA). Organ masses were normalized to both body mass and brain mass. Studies have
shown that spaee-ﬂight has signiﬁcant effects on body weight (Gridley et al., 2003), reﬂecting
changes in muscle weight and body water content. However, the brain is considered to be the
most stable organ and has been used to normalize organ masses (Chapes et al., 1999). As the
FLT and GRD mice were evaluated on separate days, the VIV control mice were used to
normalize the data, thus minimizing any day-to-day variability. Half of the VIV mice were
euthanized on each day of assessment. For example, the Flight data were normalized using the
following equation: NOM = [(1ndiVidual data point from FLT Day)/(Average 0f VIV Controls
from FLT Day)] X (Average of all VIV controls on both FLT and GRD days). A similar,
corresponding equation was used to normalize the data from the GRD controls. P values of
<0.05 and <0.1 were selected to indicate significance and trend, respectively.
RESULTS
Organ masses. There was no signiﬁcant change in the brain masses between the FLT and GRD
groups. As indicated in Table 1, there were significant decreases in masses of spleen (p<0.005),
liver (p<0.001), and thymus (p<0.001). When normalizing to body mass, there was a signiﬁcant
decrease in only the thymus (p<0.001) in FLT group compared to GRD group. However,
signiﬁcant decreases were observed for liver (P<0.001) and thymus (p<0.001) when normalized
to brain mass, with a similar trend observed for spleen (p=0.065).

Leukocyte subpopulations in Spleen. As shown in Fig. 1, there was a significant effect of
spaceﬂight conditions 011 the WBC counts (p<0.05). In addition, there were significant space-
induced decreases in all leukocyte subpopulations: lymphocytes (p<0.001),
monocyte/maerophages (p<0.005) and granulocytes (p<0.05). There were no signiﬁcant changes
in lymphocyte, monocyte/maerophage and granulocyte percentages (Table 2), however a trend
(p=0.065) was observed with monocyte/macrophages 0f FLT animals.
Spontaneous and mitogen-induced blastogenesis. Splenic spontaneous blastogenesis was
elevated in the FLT mice (p<0.001). There was a decrease in epm 0f LPS-indueed blastogenesis
(p<0.001) (Fig.2). The stimulation index of LPS-induced blastogenesis was also signiﬁcantly
reduced (p<0.005, data not shown).
Cytokine secretion by activated Splenocytes. Flight conditions had a signiﬁcant effect 011 the
levels of LPS-induced TNF-Oc, IL-6 and IL-10 (Fig.3), but not 011 IL-lB and IL-12 (data not
shown). TNF- 0c in FLT mice was signiﬁcantly lower than in GRD mice (p<0.001). On the other
hand, IL-6 and IL-10 levels were signiﬁcantly higher in FLT mice compared to the GRD mice
(p< 0.05 and p<0.005, respectively).
Gene expression. The genes that were statistically signiﬁcant (p<0.05) and varied between FLT
and GRD groups by more than 1.5 fold are presented in Table 3. Of the 84 evaluated genes, 8
were up—regulated and 4 were down-regulated. The greatest enhancement occurred in Mb (almost
143-fold), whereas the greatest suppression was noted in Serpinblb (-3.6-fold).
DISCUSSION

The spaceﬂight environment can have a dramatic impact on a variety of immune
parameters (1, 8, 29, 43). However, differences in ﬂight platforms, mission durations, animal

10

"
"11","1 1
models, and housing conditions has sometimes made interpretation of the results difficult. The
data reported here are the result of a rare opportunity in which we were able to repeat, and
expand on, a previous ﬂight experiment using a mouse model (19, 48).

The organs of interest in these studies have been the spleen, thymus, and liver. The spleen
is the largest secondary lymphoid organ and the decrease in mass reported here is similar to that
of previous spaceﬂight experiments using both rat and mouse models (11, 19, 44). In contrast,
the thymus, site of T cell maturation, has proven to be more variable, decreasing (11, 27),
increasing (50) or remaining constant (5, 7, 18), depending on the ﬂight. Interestingly, there was
a similar trend in thymus mass after our previous ﬂight, although the differences did not reach
significance (19). Finally, the liver is responsible for numerous biological activities that include
production of complement components and acute stress proteins. We found a significant
decrease in liver mass. Although, to our knowledge, liver mass has not been reported after other
spaceﬂight studies, a decrease in Kupffer cells and hepatic CYP450 cells in rats have been
reported (5 7, 58). Similar results were found when we normalized organ masses to brain mass.
In contrast, when normalized to body mass, there were no significant differences in spleen and
liver. We believe that normalizing to brain mass more accurately reﬂect changes due to animal
growth as the brain is less susceptible to transient effects (e.g. dehydration) compared to total
body mass.

The changes in organ masses suggest that the mice have been subject to psychological
and/or physiological stress in ﬂight or during landing. Unfortunately, as we were unable to
measure catecholamine 0r glucocorticoid levels, we cannot conclude whether this was an acute
or chronic response. However, exposure to the spaceﬂight environment has already been shown
to induce the release of hormones and neurotransmitters such as catecholamines and
glucocorticoids (41, 68, 71). Ground-based studies have shown that chronic elevation of these

1 1

"
"12","factors is damaging, often leading to the atrophy of lymphoid tissues (32, 61, 72) and decreases12
in organ mass (10, 60). Spaceﬂight studies on astronauts have also shown a link between
increase in stress hormones and Ebstein-Barr reactivation (54).

Splenie WBC and leukocyte subpopulation counts were also signiﬁcantly reduced after
ﬂight. A decrease in granulocyte count is consistent with our previous study (48), and similar
results were found after STS-S 7 using a rat model (23). However, there were no signiﬁcant
differences in splenie leukocytes after a shorter, 9-day ﬂight (1), suggesting that ﬂight duration
may be a critical factor. These losses likely reﬂect changes in leukocyte trafficking patterns due
to ﬂight-indueed muscle atrophy (50), changes in ﬂuid volume and distribution (43), and/or
stress. Ground-based studies have already shown that stress can result in splenoeyte apoptosis
(72).

To determine the recovery and proliferative capacity of lymphocytes, we characterized
spontaneous blastogenesis. The observed increase in [3H]-TdR incorporation by splenie
lymphocytes demonstrates that ex vivo DNA synthesis was increased after ﬂight and suggests
that the cells were capable of shifting to a proliferative (or recovery) state once removed from
any stress-induced inhibition in vivo. In contrast, LPS-induced proliferation was decreased in the
ﬂight mice indicating that the ability to respond to a potent B cell mitogen may be compromised.
There has been at least one study where investigators reported increases in the LPS response
(43), suggesting that this response may be dependent on the animal model. Interestingly,
decreases in the response to T cell mitogens (PHA and Con A) have consistently been reported
(40, 43, 64). This, combined with our results, would suggest that although there is an increase
overall proliferative capacity, there is a down-regulation of adaptive immune mechanisms.
However, further studies are required to conﬁrm this down-regulation.

12

"
"13","Ex vivo cytokine production has been shown to alter during and post ﬂight in cells 13
obtained from mice, rats, non-human primates, astronauts and cosmonauts (4, 18, 19, 65).
Cytokine concentrations in the extracellular milieu dictate proliferation and activity of
immunooytes, as well as numerous other cell types. In the present study, LPS was used for
activation of splenooytes that consisted of a mixture of leukocytes. Although LPS is often
referred to as a B cell mitogen, interactions among B cells, T cells and macrophages are
inevitable in a cellular mixture.

IL-6 is a cytokine with both pro- and anti-inﬂammatory effects that is typically secreted
by T cells and macrophages. Its ability to induce TNF-oc and IL-1B antagonists indicate that it is
a maj or factor needed for resolution of inﬂammation and the switch from innate to adaptive
immunity (28). Recent reports indicate that IL-6 is also released by contracting muscles (13, 53),
suggesting that the secretion of this oytokine may be inﬂuenced by the post-ﬂight muscle tests.
Another, albeit unlikely possibility is that the smooth muscle of blood vessels within the spleen
may be secreting IL-6. However, IL-6 levels in this study were quantiﬁed ex-vivo and any
oytokines present in the spleen and/or circulation were likely washed away in the splenooyte
processing procedure prior to stimulation. As IL-6 is also associated with increases in IL-10 and
other anti-inﬂammatory cytokines in the presence of stress and an immune challenge (9, 26, 52,
75), we believe our changes in secretion are due to persistently activated anti-inﬂammatory
mechanisms induced by spaceﬂight-related stress.

IL-10, produced by macrophages and to a lesser extent also Th2 cells, inhibits adaptive
immunity by down-regulating Th1 cytokine expression, MHC class II molecules and co-
stirnulatory proteins on AFC (42). However, the ultimate effect of both IL-6 and IL-10 is to
limit inﬂammation (26). In contrast, TNF-oc is a potent pro-inﬂammatory oytokine secreted
primarily by macrophages (3 7). The increased capacity to produce IL-6 and IL-10 seen in the

13

"
"14","present study, coupled With the low level of TNF-Oc and the absence of any change in IL-1B, 14
suggests an overall decrease in inﬂammatory mechanisms. In our previous study on STS-108,
we found an increase in PHA-indueed pro-inﬂammatory eytokines TNF-Oc and IL-2 (19). As
PHA stimulates T cells, this apparent discrepancy is likely due to differences in the target
populations of the mitogen. Further research is required to determine if this mitogen-dependent
difference in responses is due to a spaceﬂight-induced shift away from B cell to T cell
mechanisms.

Perhaps not surprisingly, there are ground-based studies Which suggest that these
differences in cytokine production may be attributed to a stress response. For instance,
adrenocorticotropie hormone (ACTH) and eatecholamines have both been shown to inﬂuence
cytokine production in the presence of LPS (31). Glucocorticoids and eatecholamines regulate
Th2 cytokine production Via stimulation of the glucocorticoid and B2 adrenergie receptors.
Through the stimulation of [32 receptors, eatecholamines up—regulate production of anti-
inﬂammatory cytokines, IL-6 and IL-10 (12, 25, 39), leading to a decrease in TNF- 0t levels (2).

An important aspect of spaceﬂight is the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) as
they play Vital roles in cell signaling, mitogen response, cell differentiation and apoptosis.
Furthermore, sustained exposure to high concentrations of ROS can lead to tumorigenesis,
diabetes and sepsis (17, 55). Increases in lipid peroxidation of human erythrocytes and
reductions in circulating antioxidant levels after long-duration spaceﬂights have been reported
(66). Using the hindlimb suspension (HS) model, Guillot et a1. (2008) (24) found that HS may
alter ROS metabolism and Fleming et a1. (1991) (15) reported an increase in superoxide
responses by murine polymorphonuclear neutrophilie leukocyte (PMNs) When exposed to short
periods of microgravity. Exposure to chronic stress has also been reported to chronically increase
ROS production and oxidative stress (67).

14

"
"15","These previously published ﬁndings are consistent with our liver gene expression data. 15
We found that many of the genes responsible for scavenging ROS were up—regulated. These
genes included F m02, involved in ROS metabolism, and peroxidases such as glutathione
peroxidase 6 and cytoglobin. Cytoglobin is also responsible for intracellular oxygen storage and
transfer and sensing of 02. By far, we saw the greatest increase in myoglobin transcript, an
important ROS transporter. The up—regulation of these genes in the FLT mice can be attributed to
cells attempting to scavenge excess ROS. These changes may also be a result of re-adaptation to
nominal G rather than an actual spaoe-ﬂight effect. Although the maj ority of the genes
responsible for ROS scavenging were up—regulated, several genes, involved in ROS production
were also up—regulated. For instance, we found an increase in a gene in the nicotinamide adenine
dinucleotide phosphate (NADPH) oxidase complex, Nox 1. However, this gene has been shown
to be involved in normal cell metabolism, including cell proliferation (33). The elevation of Nox]
in the liver of FLT mice may be due to an increase in proliferation consistent with our splenio
blastogenesis results. This, in turn, could be due to a stress-induced decrease in liver mass, in
combination with an increased demand for hepatocytes involved with clearing dead/dying cell
debris from the blood (16). N0x4 expression, on the other hand decreased. This homolog of Nox
I has been shown to be elevated in response to hypoxia (3 6), and studies have suggested that
microgravity and spaceﬂight lead to hypoxia (38, 56, 59).

The data conﬁrm that immune parameters are inﬂuenced by the spaceﬂight environment.
The results suggest that the stressors inherent to spaceﬂight missions lead to a shift toward anti-
inﬂammatory responses shortly after landing. The up—regulation in ROS scavenging genes,
suppression of LPS-induced blastogenesis, and changes in the cytokine expression proﬁle all
indicate an overall activation of anti-inﬂammatory signaling. This shift may very well be
necessary to regain homeostasis upon return to Earth. Furthermore, these data also suggest that
the response to an infection with Gram-negative bacteria may be compromised during the time

1 5

needed to regain homeostasis. However, further research is necessary to verify this possibility
(e.g. characterize changes in TLR4 expression) (34, 45).

It remains to be determined Whether homeostasis can be efficiently achieved after chronic
stress exposure experienced during extended journeys in space. Although causality has not yet
been established, at least three recently published reviews suggest a possible link between
muscle atrophy, oxidative stress, and inﬂammatory responses in disease, disuse, and exercise
models (3, 52, 73). We believe that several aspects of the spaceﬂight environment (e.g.
microgravity, lOW-dose/low-dose-rate radiation, chronic psychological and physiological stress)
lead to chronic, systemic increases in ROS. If kept unchecked, this would lead to chronic
inﬂammatory disease. As a consequence, all mechanisms involving increasing ROS as part of
normal cellular function, such as that Which occurs during an infection, have been down-
regulated. This would explain the decreases in oxidative stress related genes and increases in
anti-inﬂammatory cytokine expression. However, this idea is speculative and, t0 the best of our
knowledge, has not yet been considered in the context of space ﬂight. As long duration missions
are being planned, it is important to better understand the mechanisms responsible for the
observed changes in the immune parameters in order to reduce health risks to astronauts.
