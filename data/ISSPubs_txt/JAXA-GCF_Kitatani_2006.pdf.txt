Tomoya Kitatani,al Yoshihiro The crystal structure of NADP-dependent apO-glyceraldehyde-3-ph0sphate
Nakamura,al Kei Wada,al dehydrogenase (apo—GAPDH) from Synechococcus PCC 7942 is reported. The
Takayoshi Kinoshita,b Masahiro crystal structure was solved by melecular replacement and reﬁned to an R of
Tamoif Shigeru Shigeokac and 21.7% and Rfree of 27.5% at 2.9 A resolution. The structural features of apo-
T oshiji Tadab* GAPDH are as follows. The S-loop has an extremely ﬂeX1b1e conformation and
the sulfate ion is only taken into the classical Pi site. A structural comparison

Which has little GAPDH activity (Pupillo & Guiliani Piccari, 1975;

NADP(H) stabilizes the active form of A232, Whereas NAD(H)
induces oligomerization. The activity of Asz-GAPDH is also regu-
lated by the reversible dissociation of the supramolecular complex
PRK—CP12—GAPDH, involving phosphoribulokinase (PRK), the
regulatory peptide CP12 and GAPDH, mediated by NADP(H)
