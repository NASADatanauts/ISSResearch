This paper describes a novel miniature microcontroller based curve tracing Circuit, which was
designed to monitor the environmental effects on Silicon Carbide Junction Field Effect Transistor
(SiC JFET) device performance, while exposed to the low earth orbit environment onboard the
International Space Station (188) as a resident experiment on the 7th Materials on the International
Space Station Experiment (MISSE7). Speciﬁcally, the microcontroller Circuit was designed to operate
autonomously and was ﬂown on the external structure of the 188 for over a year. This curve tracing
Circuit is capable of measuring current vs. voltage (I—V) Characteristics of transistors and diodes. The
Circuit is current limited for low current devices and is speciﬁcally designed to test high temperature,
high drain—to—source resistance SiC JFETs. The results of each I—V data set are transmitted serially
to an external telemetered communication interface. This paper discusses the Circuit architecture, its
design, and presents example results. [http://dX.doi.org/ 10.1063/ 1.4908163]
