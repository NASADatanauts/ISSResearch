‘3 The ability to predict the atomic oxygen erosion yield of polymers based on their chemistry and physical properties
g has been only partially successful because of a lack of reliable low-Earth-orbit erosion yield data. The retrieval of the
g polymer erosion and contamination experiment after 3.95 years in low Earth orbit as part of the Materials
i International Space Station Experiment 2 provided accurate measurements of the erosion yields of 38 polymers and
E pyrolytic graphite. The resulting erosion yield data was used to develop a predictive tool with a correlation coefﬁcient
g of 0.895 and uncertainty of :l:6.3 x 10‘25 cm3 /atom. The predictive tool uses the chemical structures and physical
N“ properties of polymers to predict in-space atomic oxygen erosion yields. A technique which uses the erosion yields of
E two materials is presented to allow prediction of the erosion yield of a composite material.
