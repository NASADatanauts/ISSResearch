Abstract: Magnesium is an essential nutrient for muscle, cardiovascular, and bone health on Earth,
and during space ﬂight. We sought to evaluate magnesium status in 43 astronauts (34 male,
9 female; 47 i 5 years old, mean i SD) before, during, and after 4—6-Inonth space missions.
We also studied individuals participating in a ground analog of space ﬂight (head-down-tilt bed
rest; 11 = 27 (17 male, 10 female), 35 i 7 years old). We evaluated serum concentration and 24-h
urinary excretion of magnesium, along with estimates of tissue magnesium status from sublingual
cells. Serum magnesium increased late in ﬂight, while urinary magnesium excretion was higher over
the course of 180-day space missions. Urinary magnesium increased during ﬂight but decreased
significantly at landing. Neither serum nor urinary magnesium changed during bed rest. For ﬂight
and bed rest, significant correlations existed between the area under the curve of serum and urinary
magnesium and the change in total body bone mineral content. Tissue magnesium concentration
was unchanged after ﬂight and bed rest. Increased excretion of magnesium is likely partially from
bone and partially from diet, but importantly, it does not come at the expense of muscle tissue
stores. While further study is needed to better understand the implications of these findings for
longer space exploration missions, magnesium homeostasis and tissue status seem well maintained
during 4—6-month space missions.

1. Introduction

Magnesium is a critical element, and its amount and concentration in the body have implications
for many systems, including the cardiovascular and musculoskeletal systems, along with implications
for the incidence of hypertension, stroke, migraine headache, diabetes, and other diseases [1,2].
Given the health risks of human space ﬂight [3] along with a limited food system, adequate intake
of magnesium is an important concern for ensuring astronaut health, especially on long-duration
space missions.

One of the key issues with magnesium is that its status is not easily assessed, as is the case
with many minerals. Serum and urinary magnesium are the most obvious variables to assess, but
given that serum contains only 1% of the body pool of magnesium, changes (or lack of changes) in
these measures do not necessarily reﬂect magnesium status [1,4,5]. Tissue magnesium concentrations
provide a more direct, if not the best, assessment of magnesium status, and can be estimated through
analysis of sublingual cells [5,6]. Due to limited availability and costs, implementation of this
technique has been limited to date.

Magnesium is also important for bone health, and almost half of the body’s magnesium is
maintained in bone [1]. Good-quality diets, rich in magnesium and potassium, have been associated
with improved bone health [7,8]. Bone loss and negative calcium balance have traditionally

been considered hallmarks of space travel [3,9—12], although recent evidence documents the
ability of nutrition and exercise to mitigate bone mineral density losses after ﬂight, albeit with
remaining questions about the integrity and strength of the resulting remodeled bone [9,13,14].
Whether magnesium balance is similarly affected during space ﬂight is unknown.

Magnesium assessments before and after space ﬂight have been reviewed previously [10].
These assessments document a consistent drop in urinary magnesium after Apollo [15] and
4—6-Inonth International Space Station (188) rnissions [16], along with small declines in serum or
plasma magnesium after Apollo and Skylab rnissions [17], and slight increases in serum magnesium
after early ISS missions [10]. Beyond the normal limitations of serum and urinary magnesium
determinations, postﬂight assessments need to be examined cautiously given the ﬂuid shifts that
occur during ﬂight, and ﬂuid loading and recovery after ﬂight. Some in-ﬂight analyses from space
missions of short duration (<30 days) and up to 3 months, including some from crewmernbers on
Space Shuttle rnissions [10,18], have shown srnall declines in serum magnesium compared to preﬂight
values. The decrease was likely not statistically significant (statistics were not performed due to the
small 11 (2—6)), and the magnitude of change was also small (2.3%—8.3°/o below preﬂight values, on
average) [10,18]. On Skylab missions, urinary magnesium increased during the first 2 months of
ﬂight, did not change during the third month, and decreased after ﬂight [17].

Magnesium homeostasis is maintained through the balance of intake/absorption and renal
excretion, with the latter playing a key regulatory role [4,5]. The menu for 188 crews contains
424 i 40 mg magnesium/day (average i SD) [10]. Dietary magnesium intal<es on Shuttle Inissions
(n = 32) were lower (294 i 74) than on the ISS menu, which is not surprising given that overall energy
intake was 74.2 i 16 percent of estimated requirements for Shuttle astronauts [10]. While early
ISS crews also often did not meet energy intake requirements, many crewmernbers of late have
maintained their energy intake and body mass during 4—6-Inonth ISS rnissions [13,19].

Bed rest is the most commonly used ground-based analog to simulate the space ﬂight effects on
bone and muscle loss. One bed rest study showed slightly negative magnesium balance in untreated
bed rest, with application of exercise mitigating this trend [20]. In other bed rest studies, urinary
magnesium was unchanged during bed rest [21,22], but was significantly lower after bed rest [22],
while estimates of tissue magnesium were unchanged [23].

We present here tissue magnesium concentrations before and after long-duration space missions,
as well as urinary and serum magnesium from rnissions up to 6 months long. For comparison,
magnesium status is also reported from bed rest studies up to 90 days.

2. Experimental Section
2.1. Studies and Participants

Space ﬂight data are reported from several studies and platforms. While some of the supporting
data reported herein have been previously published, these are noted in the text throughout, and
none of the prior publications have focused on magnesium. Protocols were approved by the National
Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) Johnson Space Center Institutional Review Board
(IRB), and informed consent was obtained from all subjects. Data from several bed rest studies are
reported here, and again, many of these data have been published elsewhere [22—25], but none of the
publications have focused on magnesium. The bed rest studies were approved by the NASA Johnson
Space Center IRB, along with the University of Texas Medical Branch at Galveston’s IRB.

2.1.1. Biological Sample Collections

Procedures for collection of biological samples from the space ﬂight [13,26—29] and bed
rest [22,28] studies reported here have been previously described in detail, and are reviewed
here brieﬂy.

2.1.2. Space Flight

Data from 43 crewmernbers (34 male, 9 female) who ﬂew long-duration space ﬂights (4—6-Inonth
missions) were used for these analyses. Two crewmernbers each ﬂew on two separate ISS missions,
and on each mission each of these crewmernbers was treated as an individual subject for the purposes
of data analyses in this study. The mean age was 47 i 5 years. Blood and two consecutive 24-h
urine samples were collected about 180 and 45 days before launch, and again on landing day (return,
or R+0 day) and 30 days after landing, as previously described [13,27—29]. Urine samples were
available from 43 crewmernbers and serum from 39. Pre- and postﬂight tissue magnesium samples
were available from 33 of those subjects. When urinary and serum magnesium data were further
analyzed by type of exercise (iRED or ARED) or exercise plus bisphosphonate, one less subject was
used in those analyses due to the fact that one subject tool< bisphosphonates for only a part of the
mission. Brieﬂy, crewmernbers provided five blood and 24-h urine collections during space ﬂight at
about ﬂight day 15 (designated FD15), FD30, FD60, FD120, and FD180. Except for samples collected
on R+0, all blood samples were collected at least 8 h after food intake or exercise. Because ﬂight
durations varied, not all crews had five in-ﬂight sessions. Blood samples were collected using
standard phlebotomy techniques, as described previously [14,26—28,30]. After centrifugation, tubes
were frozen at —96 0C until they were returned to Earth (within 6 to 12 months) aboard the Space
Shuttle. An additional blood sample was collected about 10 days before launch (L-10), and those
tubes were frozen after centrifugation. The other preﬂight blood samples were aliquoted into smaller
amounts before they were frozen, to avoid repeated freezing and thawing when the samples were
analyzed. The in-ﬂight samples were transported from the landing site to Houston, where they were
stored in a —80 OC freezer until they were analyzed.

Space Shuttle 24-h urinary magnesium data were from 8 crewmernbers on two missions (STS-121
and STS-115) of about 13 and 12 days’ duration. The 24-h urine collections were conducted
15—22 days before ﬂight and immediately after landing. De-identified serurn magnesium data from
504 crewmernbers were obtained from NASA’s Life Sciences Data Archive.

Of the 33 188 crewmernbers evaluated for tissue magnesium status, 8 had access to the
interim resistive exercise device (iRED) and 25 had access to the advanced resistive exercise device
(ARED), which provided the capability for greater loads as previously described [13]. Of those 25
crewmernbers, 6 took a bisphosphonate during ﬂight as described [31].

Before and after ﬂight, urine was collected into single-void urine containers (Cole-Parrner, Niles,
IL, USA). Samples were stored with ice packs or refrigerated until they were processed, within 24 h of
collection. ln-ﬂight urine voids were collected into urine collection devices containing 1 mL of a LiCl
solution as a volume marker. These samples were processed as previously described [26—28,32,33].
2.2. Bed Rest

Twenty-seven bed rest subjects (17 male, 10 female) participated in 6-degree head-down-tilt bed
rest studies for 60 to 90 days as described previously [22,34,35]. The mean age of the bed rest subjects
was 35 i 7 years old. Seventeen of these subjects were evaluated for tissue magnesium status.

2.3. Biochemical Analyses

Blood and urine samples were analyzed for magnesium by ion-selective assay on the Olympus
AU480 (Beckman Coulter, Brea, CA, USA) [14].

Tissue magnesium concentrations were measured in epithelial cells gently scraped from subjects’
sublingual mucosa [36], as we have previously described [23] for data from 12 of the 33 subjects
reported herein. The sublingual cells were fixed on a carbon slide with cytology fixative and
later examined with a scanning electron microscope to identify individual epithelial cells suitable
for radiographic analysis (EXA; Intracellular Diagnostics, Inc., Medford, OR, USA). This method
has been shown to be reliable, and one of the most accurate estimates of tissue magnesium

10211

"4","Nutrients 2015, 7, 10209—10222
status [5,36—39]. Reported tissue magnesium concentrations are the mean of 5 to 10 cells per subject,
with normal population values being 37.9 i 4.0 mEq/ L [40].

Fractional magnesium excretion (FEMg) was estimated using the formula FEMg = [(urine Mg ><
serum creatinine)/ (serum Mg >< urine creatinine x 0.7)] x 100, where creatinine and magnesium are
expressed as rng/dL [4]. As described by Topf and Murray [41], in the presence of hypornagnesemia,
FEMg > 2% indicates inappropriate renal Mg loss and < 2% suggests that the hypornagnesernia is due
to decreased intake or changed absorption.

Bone mineral content was measured by dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry about 6 months before
ﬂight and within 1 month after ﬂight as previously described [13,14], and within 1 week before and
after bed rest [34].

2.4. Statistical Methods

All statistical analyses were performed using SigmaStat software. A one-way repeated-measures
ANOVA with a Bonferroni post hoc test was used to assess change in serum and urinary magnesium
over time. Student’s t-test was used to analyze Shuttle urine and serum data when only pre- and
postﬂight data were available. All data in graphs are reported as mean i standard deviation.

The area under the curve (AUC) for response to space ﬂight (or bed rest) was determined for
serum and urinary magnesium. The first data point used for the AUC determination was the average
preﬂight value and the last was the data point for ﬂight day 180. Pearson correlation coefficients
were determined for serum and urinary AUC and the change in total body bone mineral content
after ﬂight.

3. Results
3.1. Serum and Urinary Magnesium

On 4—6-Inonth ISS missions, 24-h urinary magnesium concentrations were significantly higher
than preﬂight concentrations by ﬂight day 15, and the elevation continued through the end of the
mission (Figure 1). During the first 48 h after landing, urinary magnesium was lower than before
ﬂight, but it had returned to the baseline concentration when measured again about 1 month after
landing (p < 0.05). When data were evaluated from the subset of crewmernbers with pre/post tissue
magnesium determinations (n = 33), the same pattern of increased urinary magnesium during ﬂight
and a decrease at landing was observed (data not shown). When serum magnesium was evaluated
for the same subset of subjects, there was a trend for higher serum magnesium during ﬂight, but
significance was only observed at the last in-ﬂight time point (FD180) and there was a decrease at
landing. When data from all available crewmernbers were included (11 = 39), serum magnesium
was increased by ﬂight day 120 and remained increased until the end of the mission (Figure 1,
p < 0.05). Similar to the urine data, serum magnesium was lower than preﬂight values on landing
day but returned to baseline after 1 month. When serum magnesium was separated by groups (iRED,
ARED, ARED+Bis), it was significantly higher at FD15 in crewmernbers who took bisphosphonates
compared to baseline and higher on FD180 among ARED subjects and lower on landing day and R+30
in ARED subjects compared to baseline (Supplemental Material: Figure 1). While these differences
were statistically significant, all data were within normal ranges, and the magnitude of change would
not be considered clinically significant.

In crewmernbers on two short-duration Space Shuttle missions (n = 8), postﬂight 24-h urinary
magnesium was no different from preﬂight (Figure 2). For a much larger (11 = 504) cohort of Space
Shuttle astronauts, no significant change occurred in serum magnesium after ﬂight (Figure 2).

During bed rest, urinary magnesium was not different from the pre-bed rest baseline; however,
24-h urinary magnesium decreased on the second and fourth day after reambulation (Figure 1,
p < 0.05, n = 27). Serum magnesium was unchanged during and after bed rest. There was a significant
effect of time (p < 0.05), but a post hoc Bonferroni t test did not identify any individual differences

10212

"
"5","Nutrients 2015, 7, 10209—10222
from baseline (Figure 1). When a subset of subjects (n = 17) from whom tissue magnesium data were
obtained were analyzed, urinary magnesium was decreased from baseline 2 days after reambulation
and serum magnesium was lower than baseline after 3 months of bed rest (p < 0.05, data not shown).

Figure 2. Urinary and serum magnesium after 2— to 18-day Space Shuttle ﬂights. The urine data are

individual data from a small study evaluating bone and mineral metabolism after ﬂight, whereas the

serum data are means i SD from routine pre- and postﬂight medical testing, and thus have a much

larger n.

In a linear regression analysis, urinary and serum magnesium AUC during ﬂight were both
significantly related to the change in total bone mineral content after ﬂight (Figure 3). The linear
regression for urinary magnesium AUC was significant for crewmembers with access to the ARED
but not those with access to the iRED or bisphosphonates (p < 0.05 and p < 0.01, respectively, for
urinary and serum magnesium). Similarly, urinary and serum magnesium AUC during bed rest

were both significantly related to the change in bone mineral content after bed rest (p < 0.01 and
p < 0.001, respectively).

Fractional excretion of magnesium (FEMg) was not different during ﬂight, but it decreased
significantly (p < 0.05) immediately after ﬂight (Supplemental Figure 2). FEMg is typically used to
evaluate magnesium loss in hypomagnesemia. While no subjects had serum magnesium meeting
the definition of hypomagnesemia (i.e., < 0.7 mg/dL), even when the lowest tertile of serum Mg was
compared to other tertiles, there was no difference in FEMg between these groups.

Figure 3. The response of urinary (n = 42) and serum (n = 38) magnesium during ﬂight, expressed as

the area under the curve (AUC), is related to the Change in total body bone mineral content (BMC)

after ﬂight on the International Space Station (upper panels), and the AUC of urinary and serum Mg

after 28 to 90 days of bed rest (n = 27 urine and serum) is related to the Change in total body BMC

after 60 to 90 days of bed rest (lower panels). Each Circle represents an individual crewmember. In the

upper panels, filled circles represent crewmembers who had access to the Advanced Resistive Exercise

Device (ARED) and open Circles represent crewmembers who had access to the interim resistive

exercise device (iRED). Crewmembers treated with the bisphosphonate alendronate are shown with

gray triangles. Pearson correlation coefficients are presented for significant correlations.
3.2. Tissue Magnesium

For 188 crewmembers, sublingual tissue magnesium concentration after ﬂight was not different
from the preﬂight (Figure 4), and there was no effect of exercise type or bisphosphonate use.

Sublingual tissue magnesium concentration did not change during bed rest for subjects
participating in either the 60-day or the 90-day bed rest study (Figure 4).

device (iRED) or the Advanced Resistive Exercise Device (ARED) [13,14]. Six subjects participated in a

bisphosphonate study in which they took an oral dose of 70 mg alendronate weekly during ﬂight [31].

There were no significant differences among groups or after ﬂight. In the right panel, data are from

4. Discussion

This is the first comprehensive evaluation of magnesium and space ﬂight. We document here
changes in serum and urinary magnesium during and after space ﬂight and similarly in ground-based
analogs. The key finding is that tissue magnesium is not affected by space ﬂight, and that while some
magnesium is likely lost from bone, there does not appear a need for overarching concern about
magnesium deficiency during 4—6-Inonth space missions.

Astronauts on long-duration ISS missions had increased serum and urinary magnesium
during ﬂight, which quickly reversed after landing. This postﬂight drop has been noted in
previous long-duration space ﬂight studies on Skylab and early ISS missions [16,42]. While it
is well documented that serum and urinary magnesium are imperfect measures of magnesium
status [1,4,41,43], these findings highlight the need for in-ﬂight research, and the need for caution
in interpreting postﬂight data with the intent of extrapolating to the in-ﬂight condition.

Potential sources for the increased serum magnesium concentration and urinary magnesium
excretion during ﬂight are bone, muscle and soft tissue, and diet. Evidence for bone resorption as a
source of increased magnesium loss are the data showing that the AUCs of the serum and urinary
magnesium responses to space ﬂight were correlated with the change in bone mineral content after
ﬂight (Figure 3). While this relationship was statistically significant only for astronauts who had
access to heavier resistance exercise loading with the ARED, the smaller number of data points
available from iRED crewmembers followed a similar pattern, and a few outliers likely marred
the statistical evaluation. Crewmembers treated with bisphosphonates, pharmaceuticals that block
osteoclast bone-resorbing activity, had urinary and serum magnesium results very similar on average
to the results for other crewmembers (ARED and iRED), albeit irrespective of bone loss. These data
suggest that bone is the likely source of the magnesium response (i.e., AUC) for amounts above that
of the ARED+Bis crewmembers. Crewmembers in the ARED+Bis group had increased serum and
urinary magnesium, along with the inability to resorb bone. From these data, we maintain that
the basal magnesium response (AUC) is sourced from dietary magnesium. Given that ARED and
ARED+Bis crewmembers consumed more energy than iRED crews [13], they likely had higher dietary
magnesium intake, which would also help account for these data.

Bed rest did not yield a significant increase in urinary or serum magnesium, which would have
been expected as some bone loss occurred in those subjects, albeit less than in astronauts [9,44,45].

10215

"
"8","Nutrients 2015, 7, 10209—10222

Nonetheless, the AUC of the serum and urinary magnesium response to bed rest was linearly related
to the change in whole-body BMC after 60—90 days of bed rest, and was less than the response
observed during space ﬂight (Figure 3). This suggests that a relationship existed between bone
and magnesium loss during bed rest, but not at the magnitude where increased serum or urinary
concentrations were evident. This lil<ely resulted in part from the dietary magnesium intake during
bed rest being generally below the RDA, and moreover being lower during bed rest than before bed
rest (secondary to a reduction in overall energy consumption) [46].

Our findings highlight the need for caution in interpreting changes in magnesium status from
blood and urine samples collected only before and after ﬂight. Well-docurnented ﬂuid shifts, and
the physiological and / or intravenous replacement of circulatory volume in the hours and days after
ﬂight, clearly affected postﬂight serum and urinary magnesium concentrations, but not estimates of
tissue magnesium. Magnesium could be a concern with respect to astronaut health, especially during
high-stress mission phases such as reentry, extravehicular activity (EVA), and landing. The fact that
tissue magnesium was maintained soon after landing, in the face of significant ﬂux in circulating and
excreted magnesium, provides reassurance that homeostasis protects critical muscle tissue stores.

In addition to high-stress mission phases, exercise effects on magnesium status are also a
potential concern for astronauts. The large amount of exercise performed by space crewmernbers [47]
generally benefits astronaut health. Besides using the resistive exercise devices mentioned before,
crewmernbers perform aerobic exercise regularly on a treadmill and a cycle ergometer. The effects of
exercise on magnesium balance (and other minerals for that matter) is not clear, and reports in the
literature are inconsistent and contradictory [48]. Sweating in microgravity brings its own oddities,
with no graVity assistance for dripping, and no convection for air cooling [49]. Concerns about
thermoregulation during space ﬂight have been raised [50,51], given the likelihood that the lack of
water removal from the body may suppress cooling and increase heat load. Nonetheless, given the
data presented herein, and the lack of change in tissue magnesium status after ﬂight, there is no
reason to conclude that increased loss of magnesium in sweat during ﬂight is a concern.

Magnesium is of specific concern with respect to cardiovascular health [1,5,52], and there
have been many studies showing the benefits of adequate (and / or supplemental) magnesium
for the cardiovascular system, and conversely concerns about the possibility that magnesium
deficiency could lead to increased incidence or severity of cardiovascular disease. The situation is
confounded by the fact that (common) treatment of hypertensive patients with diuretics will result
in increased magnesium loss. While evidence exists that blood pressure is reduced with magnesium
supplementation [53], it is worth noting that the foods that are rich in magnesium (e.g., vegetables,
whole grains) are also recommended for health benefits, in part because they are rich in other
nutrients and phytochernicals as well. Kupetsky-Rincon and Uitto have noted that additional work
is required to better understand magnesium intake in relation to health and disease, along with
further evaluation of safety and efficacy of magnesium supplementation [52]. Further evaluation
of the relationships between magnesium status and space cardiovascular data, and especially data
obtained before and after exercise and EVA conditions, is nonetheless warranted. To date (and as
those reported here), blood samples collected during space ﬂight are typically collected at least 8 h
after exercise, and days to weeks from EVA activity. Existing data should be carefully evaluated in
light of these conditions.

Magnesium has been implicated as playing a role in other medical issues as well, including
inﬂammation and insulin/glucose homeostasis. We and others have documented cytol<ine changes
during space ﬂight [54,55], but we have not found any relationships between magnesium status
(serum, urinary, or tissue magnesium) and cytokine concentrations (data not presented). We did
not determine catecholamines in the studies reported here, but recent studies in some of the same
astronauts have shown no difference in plasma epinephrine or norepinephrine during or after ﬂight
compared to seated preﬂight values, despite the ﬂuid shift to the upper body during ﬂight that
would be expected to suppress sympathetic nervous activity [56]. On short-duration Space Shuttle

10216

"
"9","Nutrients 2015, 7, 10209—10222

rnissions, urinary catecholamine excretion was lower during ﬂight [57], and sympathetic nervous
system activity was generally maintained during ﬂight, with no significant differences [58]. Thus, no
rnaj or alterations have been found in sympathetic nervous system control or activity, but clearly, this
conclusion is derived from a limited set of findings, without regard to changes during exercise.

While results of experiments have suggested that glucose metabolism and insulin insensitiVity
are altered in space ﬂight [59,60] and in bed rest [61—63], these suggestions came from rnissions
or studies in which little or no exercise was conducted. ISS crewrnernbers typically exercise
6 days per week, using a combination of aerobic and resistive exercise devices [47], and we and
others have hypothesized that this regimen will likely normalize glucose metabolism. Given our
data documenting no changes in tissue magnesium concentrations after landing, there is little
reason to speculate that magnesium deficiency may be causing altered carbohydrate metabolism.
Nonetheless, additional studies of carbohydrate metabolism during long-duration space ﬂight with
nominal exercise profiles would provide data to resolve this question.

On Earth, and there is little reason to think the situation different in space, a clear relationship
exists between energy intake and magnesium intal<e. Thus, dietary intake of magnesium is a matter
of concern for astronauts, but largely within the overarching concern of adequate dietary energy
intake [10,16]. In athletes, it has been documented that magnesium intake is maintained, except in
athletes given to energy restriction (e.g., dancers, wrestlers, gymnasts) [64]. Although a detailed
evaluation of magnesium intake during space ﬂight has not been conducted, energy intake is tracked
and crews are actively encouraged to maintain body mass during ﬂight. Recent ARED crews have
shown that it is possible to consume adequate caloric intake and maintain body mass [13]; thus
we expect that magnesium intake is adequate given we know the menu contains an adequate
amount [10]. Again, additional study of dietary intake, as currently planned for future 188 Inissions,
would resolve this question with data.

Magnesium homeostasis is a balance between absorption from the diet and renal excretion of
magnesium, with renal excretion being the key regulatory component, varying to accommodate
inﬂux from the intestines and other endogenous sources [43]. The only magnesium balance study
we are aware of that was conducted during space ﬂight was on the 14-day Gemini-VII mission [65].
Magnesium balance in these two crewmernbers was negative, and was about 100 mg/day
lower during ﬂight than before ﬂight. Dietary magnesium intake was also lower during ﬂight
(198 i 40 mg/day for each crewmernber, mean i SD) compared to preﬂight intal<e (388 i 11 mg/day
and 366 i 18 mg/ day for the two crewmernbers). These in-ﬂight intal<es are much lower than current
dietary recommendations of 420 mg/day for men 31—50 years old [43]. To our knowledge, only
one study has evaluated magnesium balance during bed rest [20]. That report included only the
net balance data, not the indiVidual components (e.g., dietary intake, urinary and fecal excretion).
In the first 120 days of bed rest, the authors found negative magnesium balance in both the control
(—58 i 21 mg/day, mean i SEM, n = 5) and exercise + bisphosphonate (—65 i 13 mg/day, n = 4)
treatment groups. In the subsequent 120-day period, the control subjects exercised, and both groups’
magnesium balance increased toward pre-bed rest levels and was close to or above zero by the
third 120-day period (Mg balance for the exercise-alone group was —5.4 i 8 mg/day, and for the
exercise + bisphosphonate group it was positive +23 i 27 mg/day). These data suggest that the
initial negative magnesium balance had little to do with bone loss, and that this effect recovers with
time. The authors attributed these results to dietary intake, and the fact that while participants
were exercising, their intakes of magnesium were greater than during the sedentary control period.
While available bed rest data are described herein, a more comprehensive evaluation of magnesium
balance and absorption in a bed rest model, with and without exercise countermeasures, would
provide valuable information.

We report here tissue magnesium during sedentary bed rest, but have not evaluated this variable
in bed rest studies evaluating exercise countermeasures. Although sublingual cell analysis is a
valuable technique, it is limited in that only one commercial lab provides these determinations and

10217

in-ﬂight determinations cannot easily be made because of required real-time sample processing.

For another approach, adapting magnesium stable isotope analysis techniques, as we have done with

calcium [66—68], could provide valuable insight into magnesium homeostasis, and could ultimately

lead to a noninvasive clinical tool to better evaluate magnesium homeostasis.

Magnesium deficiency and hypomagnesemia are most often accompanied by hypocalcemia
and hypokalemia, typically secondary to diuretic use [69]. We have never observed simultaneous
alterations in magnesium, calcium, and potassium in our data from 188 crewmembers. Furthermore,
we have never observed hypomagnesemia (serum magnesium < 0.7 mmol/L) in any 188 astronauts
to date. Nonetheless, the deficiencies typically seen on Earth with diuretic use serve as a cautionary
tale for ﬂight surgeons considering the use of diuretics in their astronaut patients.

Limitations of the studies reported here include the ever-present inherent difficulties in space
research. While the subject numbers here are respectable relative to those in much of the space
science literature, a larger sample set, including larger subgroups (e.g., sex and race) would aid
extrapolations to the general population. In-ﬂight collection of sublingual scrapes would enhance
the dataset, although this was precluded by sample collection and preservation techniques.

In summary, magnesium is a critical nutrient, with many important functions. Although on
Earth magnesium homeostasis can be altered by disease states and medication use, the data presented
here document that despite consistent and significant alterations in urinary magnesium after space
ﬂight, tissue stores of the mineral are maintained, and in-ﬂight data reveal increased serum and
urinary magnesium. Thus, we maintain there is no general cause for concern about magnesium
deficiency in astronauts. Additional studies are warranted, as discussed here, to better understand the
role of magnesium in astronaut health and to better define the nutritional requirement for magnesium
in astronauts. Findings from such studies, as with most NASA-related research, may also help inform
those interested in similar questions about magnesium for those remaining on Earth.
