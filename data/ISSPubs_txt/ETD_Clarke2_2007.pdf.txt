Abstract. Transitions to and from microgravity, as experienced during a spaceﬂight mission, radically alter the demands on

sensorimotor coordination. In this contribution, attention is directed to the vestibulo-oculomotor response to active head r011-ti1t,

generally referred to as ocular counterroll (OCR). Results are presented from a single-case longitudinal study over a 43 5-day
spaceﬂight and from three further subjects over a 30-day period in microgravity.

1. Under one-g test conditions, with the head initially in the comfortable-upright position, active head-to-trunk r011 ti1t elicits
a combined canal- and otolith-mediated oculomotor response, which manifests as a volley of torsional nystagmus beats
combined with a tonic OCR. In microgravity it appears that only the transitory canal-mediated torsional nystagmus response
remains. In both conditions the initial nystagmus response commences with an anticompensatory torsional fast phase.

2. Under zero-g conditions the head movements were comparable to those under one-g conditions but a consistent reduction in
head velocity was observed. Despite this, eye velocity and eye-head velocity gain for the torsional component were found to
be enhanced by up to 50% over the ﬁrst thirty days in prolonged microgravity.

3. The results obtained from the 435-day mission indicate that the initially enhanced response decreases — over the course of
several months — t0 preﬂight base1ine level.

The ﬁndings indicate that otolith- and canal-ocular responses are not simply added linearly, but rather that the afferent otolith signal

also plays an inhibitory, 0r stabilising role on the canal-mediated response. Further, presuming a re-weighting 0f otolithic afferent

information during prolonged microgravity, it is proposed that a corollary inverse re-weighting 0f corollary neck-proprioceptive
afferences provides an effective substitute.

In contrast to the idea that the torsional VOR is an evolutionary relic, it is postulated from the above ﬁndings that the anticom-

pensatory saccade and the inherent 10w gain of OCR result as a compromise between intended reorientation to a tilted Visual ﬁeld

and VCR compensation.

Fig. 5. The upper plot shows the eye-head velocity gain (GV) as measured over the course of Ssl ’s 435 day spaceﬂight. On the left, the values
obtained from the laboratory control group (0.39 (0.05), N = 10) are shown for comparison. The increase and ﬂuctuation in gain during the
initial days in microgravity after launch are followed by a gradual decrease over the remainder of the 435 day period. During the acute postﬂight
period the response appears to return to the pre-ﬂight control level. The lower plot depicts the corresponding head angular velocity (roll axis)
during head tilting. In comparison to the pre-ﬂight level, the angular velocity is reduced consistently over the inﬂight phase, increasing again
during the immediate postﬂight period.
