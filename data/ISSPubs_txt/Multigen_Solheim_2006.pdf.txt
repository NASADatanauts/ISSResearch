Abstract
The MULTIGEN-l ISS experiment has two objectives: a complete life cycle seed-to-seed growth experiment (about 70 days)
and simultaneous observations of Circumnutations, i.e. plant growth movements often describing Circular or elliptical paths.
MULTIGEN-l is carried out in the European Modular Cultivation System (EMCS) hardware. The subject for this study is the
shoot system of the plant Arabidopsis thaliana. The experiment provides the ﬁrst long-term observations of Circumnutations
in microgravity. Preparatory experiments in the experiment reference model and under controlled laboratory conditions are
performed. These evaluate 1-g growth behaviour under similar growth conditions as in the EMCS on the 188. The rapid
movements observed on Earth for hypocotyls, leaves and ﬂower stalks require frequent image capture over several weeks. The
Circumnutations are 3D movements, but With only one Video camera available per growth Chamber, only two dimensions can
easily be extracted. Triangulation of different plant parts using one Video source is discussed. Limited bandwidth for downlink of
images and limited onboard local storage combined With the image frequency required for recording fast moving Circumnutations
is also a strain on the system. Examples illustrating the different techniques and growth patterns are presented, as well as
available solutions and various compromises.
