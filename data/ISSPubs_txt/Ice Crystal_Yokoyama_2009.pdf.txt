The appearance of an asymmetrical pattern that occurs when a disk crystal of ice grows from supercooled
water was studied by using an analysis of growth rates for radius and thickness. The growth of the radius is
controlled by transport of latent heat and is calculated by solving the diffusion equation for the temperature
ﬁeld surrounding the disk. The growth of the thickness is governed by the generation and lateral motion of
steps and is expressed as a power function of the supercooling at the center of a basal face. Symmetry breaking
with respect to the basal face of an ice disk crystal is observed when the thickness reaches a critical value;
then one basal face becomes larger than the other and the disk loses its cylindrical shape. Subsequently,
morphological instability occurs at the edge of the larger basal face of the asymmetrical shape (Shimada, W.;
Furukawa, Y. J. Phys. Chem. 1997, B101, 6171—6173). We show that the critical thickness is related to the
critical condition for the stable growth of a basal face. A difference of growth rates between two basal faces
is a possible mechanism for the appearance of the asymmetrical shape.
Introduction ERE
We present a model of the time evolution of a disk crystal the —b

that is, growth along the c aXis of ice, is governed by slow c
molecular rearrangements on the basal faces. Growth of the
radius, that is, growth parallel to the basal plane, is controlled l t
by transport of latent heat. Our analysis is used to understand
the results obtained experimentally by Shimada and Fuirukawa.1 9 Q
