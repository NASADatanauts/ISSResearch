"2","I. Introduction
The Naval Research Laboratory has developed a satellite suite to improve precision orbit determination and
prediction by monitoring total atmospheric density between 300 and 400 km. The suite, known as the Atmospheric
Neutral Density Experiment (ANDE)1’2, consists of a series of four micro satellites with instrumentation to perform
two interrelated mission objectives. First, provide high quality satellites with stable and well—determined coefﬁcients
of drag to calibrate techniques and models for precision orbit determination. Second, provide detailed atmospheric
composition to validate new ultraviolet remote sensing techniques. The DOD Space Test Program will provide
launch services and deployment into orbit for two missions, each mission ﬂying a pair of ANDE spacecraft. The
Atmospheric Neutral Density Experiment Risk Reduction (ANDERR)3 mission was launched on Dec. 9, 2006
onboard the STS—116, Space Shuttle Discovery, and deployed (as seen in Fig. 1) into orbit on Dec. 21, 2006. This
paper will focus on the ANDERR ﬂight, which consists of two spherical spacecraft with retro—reﬂectcrs for satellite
laser ranging (SLR). On Dec. 25, 2007 the MAA spacecraft re—entered the atmosphere, the FCal spacecraft, which is
smaller and heavier than the MAA, re—entered the atmosphere on May 25, 2008. The international laser ranging
0 service (ILRS)4 tracks the satellites and amateur HAM radio enthusiasts provide telemetry acquisition; the
g ANDERR data set is extensive.
g? The primary ANDERR mission obj ective was to test the deployment mechanism from the Shuttle for the ANDE
i ﬂight in mid—2009. ANDERR ﬂight scientific objectives include: monitor total neutral density along the orbit for
g improved orbit determination of resident space objects; monitor the spin rate and orientation of the spacecraft; and,
g provide a test object for the space surveillance network (SSN) sensors, both radar and optical. The spacecraft each
5 contain a small lightweight payload designed to determine the spin rate and orientation of the spacecraft from on—
E orbit measurements and from ground based observations. The constant and well—determined cross section and
9c; surface properties of the ANDERR spherical spacecraft provide an ideal set of objects for monitoring atmospheric
§ drag and the calibration of SSN assets. The ANDERR data provide a global climate monitoring metric, which
:5 showed an over—speciﬂcation of total density by climatology models that was in agreement with the ﬁndings of
jg! Emmert and Picones, who have shown a consistent decrease in thermospheric density of the past three decades.

"3","The primary science objective depends critically upon the exterior surfaces of the ANDERR, however the the
spacecraft’s interior space is available to perform other functions. The interior can be utilized for additional
experiments and payloads so long as the interior masses are balanced so that the center of gravity remains at the
geometric center. Each of the four spacecraft has their interior populated differently to accommodate respective
science goals. One spacecraft in the ANDE mission (launch expected in May, 2009 on STS—127) will contain
instrumentation to measure the neutral and ion composition directly while the other spacecraft contain the
subsystems necessary to measure and/or derive the secondary science obj ectives.

The primary mission of the ANDE program is to accurately determine the total atmospheric density along the
orbit of the spacecraft. The major source of error in determining the orbit of objects in Low Earth Orbit (LEO),
altitudes less than 1000 km, is the computation of acceleration due to atmospheric drag. This acceleration is
governed by the equation,

1 2
ad = ——pr (1)
o 2
g where ad is the acceleration, p is the atmospheric density and v is the orbital velocity relative to the medium
g (including cross—track and radial velocities). The ballistic coefﬁcient6, B, is given by
2 CDA
a B m (2)
§ with CD being the coefficient of drag, A the projected frontal area and m the mass of the object.
g The technique to derive the total atmospheric density from radar and optical observations of the ANDERR
E; spacecraft is described in detail by Nicholas et al. (2007)7. The entire ANDERR data set was analyzed with this
i method using the NRL Mass Spectrometer Incoherent Scatter Radar Extended, NRLMSISE—OO, modelg.
E“ II. Modeled CD Values
g A limitation in drag models typically applied in orbit determination software is the inability to adequately
2 characterize variations in the ballistic coefﬁcient, B (Eq. 2). Some changes in B are driven by variations in CD,
E arising from surface material, surface temperature, angle of incidence, atmospheric temperature and atmospheric
5’ species as the satellite moves through the atmosphere. Additionally, the projected frontal area, A, and satellite mass,
§ m, may vary as a function of time. The cross—track and radial forces, in addition to the CD, change with the incidence
(E angle of the atmospheric ﬂow upon each component area of the spacecraft. Estimation of constant scale factors to
g the standard formulation for drag (Eq. 1) will not account for this variation, nor will modeling of the projected area.

The 20th Space Control Squadron, USAF in Dahlgren, VA, processes US Space Surveillance Network (SSN)
radar observation data of the two ANDERR spacecraft. The product is a set of vectors that is provided to NRL,
along with the radar observations, up to three times a day. These state vectors are processed at NLR using Special—K
orbit determination software14 to produce a set of ephemeredes. These ephemeris ﬁles are reformatted into the
consolidated prediction format (CPF)15 used by the ILRS tracking stations. This format consists of one—minute
satellite state vectors (X, y, and 2 positions and velocities at a given time plus other parameters) over the several day
prediction period. These predictions are distributed Via the NASA CDDIS data center and the European Data Center.

IV. Data Processing and Analysis
Version 5.01 of OCEAN was configured to make weighted least squares estimates of the initial conditions and
the scale factor for the drag model. The observation data were sampled at 48—hour intervals (beginning in the
middle of a day) and the ﬁt and prediction ﬁnal ephemeris was produced. The observation data were corrected for
known biases (and center of mass) and weighted using past sensor performance values so that the SLR data
naturally biases the solutions toward reality in the hybrid SSN and SLR runs. The high ﬁdelity force models
including either EGM—96 0r GGMOZC at degree and order 70x70, the ocean tides, the M818 density models, the
HWM93 theromospheric winds, and all IERS conventions frames and displacement typical for accurate SLR
processing.
A comparison between the resulting MAA CD and FCal CD from the OCEAN run, using NRL MSISE2000 and a
priori area and mass information, yields excellent agreement between the two obj ects even as the altitude separation

standard deViation of 0.156. The average CD value for FCal is 1.65 with a standard deViation of 0.168. These results
are clearly non—physical as seen from Eq. (1), as the value is well below 2.0. The NRLMSISE—OO model is over—
estimating the atmospheric density by about 25% on average and the OCEAN code is correcting for this by sealing
the B term down. This over—estimation of the thermospheric density is in direct agreement with the ﬁndings of
Emmert and Picone5. The average ratio of the ﬁtted CD to the modeled CD (the necessary “correction” to MSIS) for
MAA is 79.0% with a standard deViation of 7.38% and the average ratio for FCal is 78.3% with a standard deViation
of 7.93%. The retrieved values of CD for the two spacecraft are presented as a function of time in Fig. 4.

CD values for the MAA spacecraft (corrections to the MSIS model) also indicate some short period osci11ations
although they are not as clearly correlated with either the Ap, VSW or F107 as the ﬁtted CD values, as derived by the
orbit determination process, are a correction to the MSIS model which uses both the geomagnetic (Ap) and the solar

and very weak periodicities at 5 and 7 days. The 27—day period is strong in the Ap and VSW data and to a lesser extent
the SEE data, whereas the F107 data exhibit a weak periodicity at 27—days. A strong 18—day period is observed in the
ﬁtted CD values, which correlates with the broad peak in the F107 data at 18 days. Lower frequency periodicities are
not present in either the SEE data or the F107 data indicating that the atmosphere is responding to the geomagnetic
drivers at the shorter periods. The atmospheric corrections (ﬁtted CD values) show a distinct correlation with both
the Ap and VSW data at 9 days. The short 5— and 7—day periods are present in the Ap and VSW data. These 5— and 7—day
periods correlations were strong in the 2005 CHAMP density data19 but are vary weak in the ANDERR data. This
may be attributed to the fact that the ANDERR MAA is at a lower inclination (512°) than the CHAMP satellite
(873°), which observed stronger density variations at higher latitudes”.

A Morlet wavelet analysis was performed on the CD density corrections; F107, Ap and VSW time series to further
investigate the periodicities observed during 2007. The wavelet power spectra are presented in Fig. 7 as a function
of day of year for 2007. The plots have been formatted to a range of 2 to 20 days with white contours representing
the 95% signiﬁcance level. It is clear that the short—term oscillations (5,7,9 days) were much more prevalent and
stronger in both the Ap and VSW data in the ﬁrst half of 2007 than in the second half of the year. This is also evident
in the 9—day period in the CD atmospheric corrections derived from the MAA spacecraft orbits. The strong 18—day
periods observed in the F107 data are also observed in the CD corrections although there is a significant time lag and
atmospheric recovery period associated with this data.

E V. Conclusion
5’ It is clear that the ANDERR spacecraft are useful calibration targets due to their well-characterized size and
0% shape. The SLR observations performed by the members of the ILRS have been used to augment the radar data to
(Q constrain the accuracy and stability of the estimated ballistic coefﬁcient and to assess the accuracy of the predictions
g with absolute conﬁdence. These results are based upon two ANDERR spacecraft, which are at different altitudes as
j: the mission progressed. The data show a consistent over estimation of the density by the NRLMSISE-OO model by
Q an average of 26.6%. The over speciﬁcation of total density is in agreement with the findings of Emmert and
E Picones, who have shown a consistent decrease in thermospheric density of the past three decades.
§ The analysis technique applied to the ANDERR data set separates geomagnetic forcing of the atmosphere from
3 solar irradiance forcing of the atmosphere. The analysis conﬁrms that CIRs with short term 5-,7-,9- day oscillations
E similar to those observed with CHAMP in 200518’19 persisted into the first half of 2007 and were observable in the
Q ANDERR data at lower altitudes than observed by CHAMP. Moreover, although the inclination of the ANDERR
satellites is only 512"" we observe geomagnetic forcing effects at these mid- to low-latitudes hat were seen in the
polar orbiting (873°) CHAMP data .

The M818 model is not properly capturing the effect of geomagnetic forcing (especially at low end of the
solar/geomagnetic forcing range), as correlations are evident in the ﬁtted CD values with the geomagnetic ap index
and the solar wind velocity at short periods of 5-, 7-, and 9-days. M818 is also not capturing the 18-day period
observed to correlate with the F107 cm ﬂux data. The analysis of the SEE irradiance data did not yield signiﬁcant
oscillations below the 27-day solar rotation period.
