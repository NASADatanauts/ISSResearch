Abstract: In order to conﬁrm the results of previous experiments concerning the chemical behaviour
of organic molecules in the space environment, organic molecules (amino acids and a dipeptide) in pure
form and embedded in meteorite powder were exposed in the AMINO experiment in the EXPOSE-R
facility onboard the International Space Station. After exposure to space conditions for 24 months
(2843 h of irradiation), the samples were returned to the Earth and analysed in the laboratory for reactions
caused by solar ultraviolet (UV) and other electromagnetic radiation. Laboratory UV exposure was
carried out in parallel in the Cologne DLR Center (Deutsches Zentrum fiir Luft und Raumfahrt).
The molecules were extracted from the sample holder and then (1) derivatized by si1y1atior1 and analysed
by gas chromatography coupled to a mass spectrometer (GC—MS) in order to quantify the rate of
degradation of the compounds and (2) analysed by high-resolution mass spectrometry (HRMS) in order
to understand the chemical reactions that occurred. The GC—MS results conﬁrm that resistance to
irradiation is a function of the chemical nature of the exposed molecules and of the wavelengths of the
UV light. They also conﬁrm the protective effect of a coating of meteorite powder. The most altered
compounds were the dipeptides and aspartic acid while the most robust were compounds with a hydrocarbon
chain. The MS analyses document the products of reactions, such as decarboxylation and decarbonylation
0f aspartic acid, taking place after UV exposure. Given the universality of chemistry in space, our
results have a broader implication for the fate of organic molecules that seeded the planets as soon as
they became habitable as well as for the effects of UV radiation on exposed molecules at the surface of
Mars, for example.
