The space enVironrnent presents a number of threats that
impact the functionality and survivability of spacecraft.
These include: AO, vacuum, UV radiation, Charged particle
radiation, X-rays, thermal cycling, and MMOD. To mitigate
Systems these threats for the extended duration human and robotic
missions that NASA is planning, space environmental

The 188 is an ideal platform to conduct space environmental
testing and has been used to support the MISSE series of
