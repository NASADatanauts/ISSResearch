ABSTRACT
NF-KB is a transcriptional activator of many genes, including some that lead to muscle atrophy and bone resorption—significant
concerns for astronauts. NF-KB activation is inhibited by eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA), but the influence of this omega—3 fatty acid on the
effects of weightlessness are unknown. We report here cellular, ground analogue, and spaceflight findings. We investigated the effects of
EPA on differentiation of RAW264.7 monocyte/macrophage cells induced by receptor activator of NF-KB ligand (RANKL) and on
activation of NF-KB by tumor necrosis factor a (TNF-a) or exposure to modeled weightlessness. EPA (50 ptM for 24 hours) inhibited
RANKL—induced differentiation and decreased activation of NF-KB induced by 0.2 ptg/mL of TNF-a for 30 minutes or by modeled
weightlessness for 24 hours (p<.05). In human studies, we evaluated whether NF-KB activation was altered after short—duration
spaceflight and determined the relationship between intake of omega—3 fatty acids and markers of bone resorption during bed rest and
the relationship between fish intake and bone mineral density after Iong-duration spaceflight. NF-KB was elevated in crew members after
short—duration spaceflight, and higher consumption of fish (a rich source of omega—3 fatty acids) was associated with reduced loss of
bone mineral density after flight (p < .05). Also supporting the cell study findings, a higher intake of omega—3 fatty acids was associated
with less N-telopeptide excretion during bed rest (Pearson r:—0.62, p < .05). Together these data provide mechanistic cellular and
preliminary human evidence of the potential for EPA to counteract bone loss associated with spaceflight. © 2010 American Society for
