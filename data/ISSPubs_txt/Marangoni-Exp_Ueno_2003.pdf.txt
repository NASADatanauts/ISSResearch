INTRODUCTION ' '

Thermocapillary-driven convection arises if a non-uniform temperature distribution exists over a free surface. It
takes place inevitably even in thespace environmeng'where a buoyant force can be almost negligible. The space is
expected to be an ideal environment to process a high-quality materials or crystals, In order to realize such new
material processing in the space, however, one must understand the ﬂow ﬁelds induced by the thermocapillary forces.
Although it is found that the oscillation of the thennocapillaIy-driven ﬂow in high-Prandtl number ﬂuids exhibits a
different behavior ﬁlm that of a low-Prandtl number ones (Smith and Davis, 1983), both are induced by the
coupling of the surface temperature variation and the internal velocity ﬁeld. In the present study, the anthem focused

-upon the ﬂow ﬁelds of a high Prandtl number of 0(10). ' .

In ahalf zone (HZ) model, a liquid bridge is sustained between ""cylindrical hot and cold rods; that is, the half of
a, ﬂoating zone (F Z) method is mimicked. The thermocapillary ﬂow develops from the hotter to colder end rods
with a temperatm'e difference AT. The intensity of the induced ﬂow can be described by using the Marangoni
number deﬁned as Ma 5 (GTAT-H)I(pv1<) = (GTAT-ID/(pv2)-(v/K) = RedoPr, where GT is the temperature coefﬁcient
of the surfaee tension (= |60/6Tl), H the height of the liquid bridge,_ p the density, v the kinematic viscosity, 1; the
thermal diffusivity. The Marangoni number can be expressed as the product of the thermocapillary Reynolds
number Re6 and Prandtl number Pr. Experimental and numerical studies have been Widely conducted on this system,
indicating that there exiSts a critical temperature difference between the rods. When the temperature difference
exceeds the critical value ATc, or Ma > Mac, the ﬂow ﬁeld exhibits a transition ﬁ'om a two-dimensional steady ﬂow to
a three-dimensional' time-dependent ‘oscillatory’ one. With further inCreasing AT after the onset of the oscillation,
the ﬂow presents standing- and traveling-type convections. . . ' ' - -

The transition and the structures of the oscillatory ﬂow ﬁeld have been investigated extensively in the last
three decades. Thwe works were mainly concerned with the critical point of the onset of the oscillation and with the
ﬂow structures a little beyond the criticality. Little information has been obtaihed regarding the ﬂow ﬁelds far
beyond the critical point except by Velten et al. (1991) and Frank and Schwabe (1997). They conducted a series of
experiments with several kinds of test ﬂuids of moderate to high Prandtl number and reported the chaotic behaviors
0f the surface temperature variation by use of two dimensional Poincare map. In the present study the ﬂow ﬁelds
induced by an imposed large temperature difference were focused. Several kinds of new ﬂow regimes after the
well-known standing- and u'aveling-type oscillations were found and categorized through ﬂow visualization and

diameter of the rods was 5.0 mm. The aspect ratio F (= F'g' 1' ExDer'memal apparatus

rod was made of aluminum, with a chemically coated m
sidewall to prevent wetting by the liquid. A

temperature difference AT between the end surfaces

was imposed by heating the top rod. With this conﬁguration there exists both thermocapillary and buoyancy forces.
The relative importance of ' two different forces can be evaluated by considering the dynamic Bond number Bod E
Gr/Reo, where Gr is the Grashof number deﬁned as gBATHs/vz, g ‘ the gravity and [5 the thermal eXpansion
coeﬂicient. In a typical case of I‘ = 0.64 and AT = 50 K, the system has a value of Bod = 000‘). Thus
buoyancy-d’riven ﬂow is negligibly Small in this conﬁguration.

The ﬂow was visualized by susmding Polystyrene particles of 20 pm in diameter in the ﬂuid as tracers. The
ﬂow ﬁeld was observed through two CCD cameras simultaneously at a frame rate of 30 fps; one from the tap and
the other from the side. A continuous light Source illuminated the entire bridge; thus the captured views presented
the integrated ﬁelds. ' , '

, A time series of the temperature slightly inside of the bridge was measured at mid-height with a Cr-Ar
thermocouple (T/C) of 0.025 mm in diameter at a sampling fate of 50 Hz. Preliminary tests were carried out in
order to determine most suitable T/C4junction positioﬁat which {the ﬂuid temperature ceuld be exactly measm'ed
while maintaining the eﬂ'ect upon the particle motion minimal. Hereafter, the measured tealperatm‘e at this 'locatien
is called the surfaCe temperature. The temperature oscillation was measunedaﬁer an elapsed time of 5 minutes to
make sure that the ﬂow ﬁeld was fully deVeloped for each designated AT condition.

It is' noted that the temperature dependence of the ﬂuid viscosity catinot be neglected in experiments with a large
AT. The ﬂuid viscosity is evaluated at the mean ternperature T = (TwTL)/2 as the reference temperature with the uSe
of an empirical correlation (Shin-Etsu Chem. Co., Ltd., 1991). .

RESULTS AND DISCUSSIONS .

Through the observed particle motion and the Fourier spectrum of the surface temperature variation, the
induced ﬂow structures can be categorized into eight regimes (R3. 1 to 8). A regime Rg. with a larger number
basically corresponds to a ﬂow struCtm-e emerging at a larger teinperatm'e difference at a ﬁxed F. The ﬂow regime
was primarily determined by the temperature difference AT and the aspect ratio F. It further depended upon the
increasing rate of the temperature diﬁ’erence and its history. Some of these regimes did not appear depending upon
the experimental procedures and conditions. ' '

An overview of typical ﬂow structure in each regime is presented in Figure 2. Flow ﬁelds with an azimuthal
wave number m = 3 was observed at this aspect ratio (Ueno et al., 2000). Note that a modal Structm'e with different

wave number emerges when the aspect ratio is varied (Ueno et al., 2003). Figure 2 contains three columns of
illusu'ations; (l) the» top view of the ﬂow ﬁeld, (2) the power spectrum density (PSD) of the surface temperature
variation, and (3) the reconstructed pseudo-phase space (PPS) ﬁom-the surface temperature. The reconstmction of
PPS was conducted from a single time series of the ﬁtlly developed surface temperature by applying the
time—delayed coordinates. The g-dimensional coordinate is deﬁned as vg(t) = (T(t), T(t+t), T(t+21,'), m, T(t+(§-1)t)),
where T(t) is the surface temperature at time t, and 1: the delay time. Note that the PPS illustrated in Figures 2-(3)
was reconstructed ﬁ-om the temperature ﬂuctuation around an averaged value. The trajectories shown in Figure 2
are reconstructed with a constant delay time of 1: = 0.1 s for Rg. 2 to Rg. 6 and with t = 0.06 s for Rg. 7 and Rg. 8.
They consist of 2 000 points. Several delay times around 0.1 s were examined to conﬁrm that the trajectories had
the same shape irrespective of the delay times in a primary analysis.

Deﬁnition of - Flow Regime ,
3g. 1: SM Flow _

With a small AT, the ﬂow ﬁeld shows 2-D antisymmetric ‘steady’. ﬂow (see Figures 2-(a))._The tracer particles
show only radial motion if observed from the top. They circle in the r-z plane. The surface temperature at a ﬁxed
point maintains at a constant value at a ﬁxed AT. Thus, the trajectory in the PPS becomes a ﬁxed point (not shown).
Bg_2:Pul_satingF_low_I

Aﬂer the onset of transition, the particles exhibit azimuthal motion in addition to their movement in the r-z
plane. The Marangoni number at the critical point is usually called as the critical Marangoni number Mac. With
increasing Ma above Mac, the convective ﬁeld indicates modal structures in R33. 2 and 3. The boundary between
Rgs. l and 2 has already been recognized well as the critical point of the ﬂow transition ﬁom 2-D steady to 3-D
time-dependent ﬂows. The critical condition is discussed in Ueno et al. (2000).

In these regimes of Rgs. 2and 3, a polygonal particle-ﬁ'ee region is observedthrough the top end surface; that
is, tiny particles disperse in the region between the free surface and the particle-ﬁee polygon, and hardly break into
the inside of the polygonal region once the modal structure is established. . '

At the early stage of the oscillation, the modal structure ﬁrst exhibits a pulsating or standing—wave state (Rg.
2). Figure 2-(b)-(1) shows a snapshot of Rg. 2 ﬂow. This picture indicates the transient shape during the turning
over of the triangle through the pulsation. The particles are trapped within a unit azimuthal sector (1/6 = 1/(2m)
azimuthally-divided region in this case) and seldom penetrate into the neighboring one. The Surface temperature
variation of this regime Rg. 2 consists of the fundamental and its harmonics (F igure 2-(b)-(2)). The fundamental
frequency is about 1.9 Hz, Which agrees well with the ﬁ'equency of the pulsating motion of the triangle. The latter
was obtained ﬁ'om the successive video frames. In this case the time series of the surface temperature was measured
at the antinode of the pattern oscillation.

_R__g. 3: Rotating Flow I

With increasing AT, the polygonal particle-ﬁ'ee zone in the bridge starts to rotate azimuthally (Rg. 3). Figure
2-(c)-(1) shows a snapshot of the ﬂow in Rg. 3. Boundary lines of the sectors and the particles migrate
randomly in the whole ﬁeld. In Rg. 3 the direction of rotation cannot be predicted. The periodic ﬂuctuation of the
temperature corresponding to the modal structure rotation is still observed. The smfaee-taemperature variation of Rg.
3 is quite similar to that of Rg. 2. It should be noted that the surface temperature oscillation in Rg. 3 consists of a
lower fundamental ﬁequency than R32 despite the higher Ma. This tendency was also predicted by a numerical
analysis concerning a medium-Pr-ﬂuid liquid bridge (Leypoldt et al., 2000). The PPSs of the ﬁrst pair of pulsating
and rotating ﬂows exhibit periodic orbits as shown in Figures 2-(b)-(3) and 2-(c)-(3). Existing works have mainly
focused upon the regimes up to Rg. 3. '
3g. 4: Transition

Further increasing AT, a distinct modal structure disappears and the particles again disperse into the whole
ﬁeld (Rg. 4) as shown in Figure 2-(d)-(1). The visualized ﬂow ﬁeld seems to be consisted of randomly mixed
structure of rotating (Rg. 3) and pulsating (Rg. 5) convections. A high-frequency ﬂuctuation appears in the surface
temperature variation, while the main frequency still persists as shown in Figure 2-(d)—(2). Although no distinct
ﬂow structures were observed, the trajectm'y in the PPS clearly indicates a periodic behavior. This regime Rg4 is
thus considered as a transition region of the ﬂow structures between the ﬁrst (Rgs. 2 and 3) and the second (Rgs. 5
and 6) pairs of pulsating and rotating oscillatory ﬂows. .

It should be neted that oscillatory ﬂow field with a certain azimuthal. wave number m emerges at a limited
range ‘of the aspect ratio; at the periphery of the range, the standing—Wave type oscillation favorably appears. In
increasing AT, the ﬂow seldom exhibits a steady rotating ﬂow. The ﬂow clanges from kg. 2 to Kg. 4 and. then Kg.
5. At the center of the range, on the other hand, preferred ﬂow pattem is traveling—wave type oscillation. 'In.

With increasing AT, another rotating oscillatory ﬂow
or traveling—wave oscillation emerges as Rg. 6. As Fig- 3- Surface Wm“? van'ation (top) and its
aforementioned, the rotating oscillatory ﬂow tends to short-time Fourier spectrum (W) for the
emerge at the center of the existing range of the ﬂow transition from RQ- 6to R9- 7 att~13 3-
structure with wave number m in terms of the aspect ratio.

In this regime the particles tend» to accumulate along a

single closed path (see Figure 2-(0—(l)). Particle accumulation structure (PAS) in the HZ bridge was ﬁrst observed
as a side viewby use of a vertical light sheet by. Schwabe et a1. (1996), who called this stmctme as ‘cloud.’ Its three
dimensional structure was reconstructed by Tanaka et al. (2000) for the ﬁrst time by simultaneous obserVation of
the top and side views, and was named as the twisted-loop paxticle accumulation structure (TL-PAS). The
fundamental frequency of Rg. 6 is lower than that of Rg. 5. Such features are also detected in the ﬁst pair of the
regimes (Rgs. 2 and 3). As shown in Figures 2-(e)-(3) and 2—(t)—(3), their attractors become more twisted than those
of the ﬁrst pair. In-addition, the orbit is more twisted in Rg. 6 than in Rg. 5. This tendency is qualitatively the Same
in the relation between Rgs. 2 and 3. It was also found that the ﬂow exhibits the TL-PAS at various modal number
m with varying F as seen in Rgs. 2 and 3. Their features and three-dimensional structures were described in Ueno et-
al. (2000) in more detail. .

3g. 7: Chaotic Flow I And 3g. 8: Chaotic Flow 11 '

With ﬁirther- inerease AT, the ﬂow ﬁeld exhibits a tranSition to chaotic state. The distinct particle accmnulation
structure disappears and theparticles disperse in the whole ﬁeld again (Figures 2-(g)-(1) and 2-(h)—(l)). The surface
temperature variation mostly 10sec its periodic nature, and its power spectrum broadens. The peaks are ahnost buried
in the continuous frequency spech11m'(Figmes 2-(g)-(2) and 2-(h)-(2)). Although almost no distinct diﬁcrenee is
apparently observed in the visualized ﬂow ﬁelds nor in the surface temperature variation, an evident difference is
indicated in the reconstructed PPS between Rgs. 7 and.8 as seen in Figures 2-(f}-(3) and 2-(g)-(3). In Rg. 7 the
trajectory scatters and does not form a sharp and deﬁnite route, but nevertheless retains a certain structure in the PPS.
In Rg. 8, on the other hand, the trajectory in the PPS exhibits no ordered structure. This indicates that no periodic.
structure exists, that is, that the ﬂow exhibits a transition to the turbulent state. Such tendencies can be recognized also
by applying die short-time Fourier transform. Figure 3 indicates the surface temperature variation (tap) and its
short-time F ourier spectrogram (bottom) for the transition region between Rgs. 6 and 7. In the spectrogram, one can
observe the time series of the variation of the frequency distribution. In the regime Rg. 6, a constant ftmdamental
frmueney of f0 ~ 2.4 Hz and its harmonics are clearly observed until t ~ 13 s. The power of the fundamental ﬁ'equency
has the largest value and those of harmonics decrease gradually as the ﬁ'equeney increases. Such information from the
spectrogram corresponds to the one obtained ﬁ‘om the normal Fourier transformation. The flow ﬁeld exhibits a
transition from Rg. 6 to Rg. 7 at t ~ 13 3. Sharp peaks of the ﬁmdamental and harmonic ﬁ‘equencies gradually

"

disappear, but broadened peaks still remain with time dependent ﬂucmations. This causes scatter of the attractor in
the PPS as seen in, Figure 2—(g)-(3), while the ﬂuctuating main ﬁ'eqtleney retains the quasi-peﬁodiestmcture- of the
attractor. In the more disorderedﬂow regime of Kg. 8, on the other hand, broadband noise dominates the ﬁequency
space. One cannot distinguish any sharp main ﬁequency during this observation period. Such broadened distribution
of the ﬁ'equency reﬂects the disordered behavior of trajectory in the PPS. Considering further the continuous
spectrum of Rg. ’8, the ﬂow regime Rg. 8 may be regarded as a more developed turbulent state, while the regime R‘g.
7 as a transient chaotic state between the ordered structure Rg. 6 and the turbulent state of ‘Rg. 8. It islrevealed that
the regimes of Rgs. 7 and 8 retain both of the fractal structmeand the sensitivityto initial conditlons of the attractor
in the space, byﬁe ﬁactal values of the correlation dimension, and the positive maxmmm Lyapunov
exponents, respectively (Ueno et at, 2003). One can thus conclude thatthese ﬂow remes maintam chaotic mane.

""Ihegthermoeapillaty-driven ﬂow in a half-zone liquid bridge was investigated experimentally. The regimes of
convection ﬁelds were categorized ﬁom ﬁe steady to the turbulent ﬂows through the observation of the suspended
particle motion, the surface "" variation, its Fourier spectrum and trajectory in the reconstructed
pseudo-phase space. ' .

After the omet of the oscillalon, _ g and then rotating ﬂows emerged. After once exhibiting a ttmsition
regime, another type 0f the puhatmg or? rotating ﬂow appeared again. The ﬂow structures of these second pulsating
and rotating, ﬂow were quite dﬁferentﬁ'om ‘the former ones. These ﬂow regimes still retained quasi-periodic
structures. In the second rotating ﬂow, one can observe unique particle motion in the liquid bridge, Which is. known
as the dynamic particle accumulation structure (dynamic PAS). Further mereasing the temperature dtforonce from
the second mtating ﬂow, the chaotic and turbulent states were realized. The non-hnear behaviors of the ﬂow ﬁelds
can be analyzed quantitatively by the reconstruction of the pseudo-phase space and the evaluation of the correlation
dimension and the maXimum Lyapunov exponent.
