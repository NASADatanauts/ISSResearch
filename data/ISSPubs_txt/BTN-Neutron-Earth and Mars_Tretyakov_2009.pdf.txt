Preliminary estmations for neutron dose in space on
188 orbit are: 0.2 InZV/hour (equatorial areas); 0.8
mZV/hour (near polar areas); 5.0 InZV/hour (South
Atlantic Anomale). Dose for Martian orbit varies in
range 0.8 — 1.1 InZV/hour.

Conclusion: These estimations are converted eas—
ily into the doze rate for long interplanetary ﬂight and
for long stay at different regions on the Martian sur—
face. In 2009 — 2010, when the rising phase of the next
24th solar cycle will be in progress, the data of meas—
urements 0f HEND/MO and BTN/ISS will allow to
model space environment for more complex condi—
tions, when decreasing ﬂux of galactic cosmic rays
will be compensated by episodes of powerful solar
particles events.
