ARTICLE INFO ABSTRACT
Article history: The R3DR2 instrument performed measurements in the European Space Agency (ESA) EXPOSE—R2 plat—

iizesetdd2§4M§IrChhzggi6 tober 2014—11 January 2016. It is the Liulin—type deposited energy spectrometer (DES) (Dachev et al.,
p e arc 2015a). Took place in November 2014, this was the ﬁrst attempt to monitor a small solar energetic parti—
cle (SEP) event outside 155 using the Liulin—type DES (Dachev et al., 2015d). In this study, we describe the
dosimetric characteristics of the largest SEP event, observed on 22 June 2015 with the R3DR2 instrument
outside 155. The main ﬁnding of this study is that SEP protons with a minimum energy of approximately
7 MeV at the surface of the R3DR2 detector produced high dose rates, reaching >5000 pLGy h—1, while the
inner radiation belt maximum dose was at the level of 2200 pLGy h‘l. If a virtual external vehicle activity
(EVA) was performed in the same period of the SEP maximum on 22 June 2015, the doses obtained in the
skin of cosmonauts/astronauts can reach 2.84 mGy after 6.5 h, which is similar to the average absorbed
dose inside 155 for 15 days (Reitz et al., 2005). A comparison with other extreme events measured with
Liulin—type instruments shows that SEPs similar to that observed on 22 June 2015 could be one of the
most dangerous events for the cosmonauts/astronauts involved in EVA.
