[1] The Cloud-Aerosol Lidar Infrared Pathﬁnder Satellite Observations (CALIPSO)
satellite provides a new and exciting opportunity to study clouds and aerosols in the
Earth’s atmosphere using range-resolved laser remote sensing. Following the successful
launch of the CALIPSO satellite, validation ﬂights were conducted using the long-
established Cloud Physics Lidar (CPL) to verify CALIPSO’s calibration and validate
various CALIPSO data products. This paper presents results of the initial comparisons
made between the spaceborne CALIPSO lidar and the airborne CPL. Results are presented
to validate measurement sensitivity and the spatial properties reported in the CALIPSO
data products. Cloud layer top determinations from CALIPSO are found to be in good
agreement with those from CPL. Determinations of minimum detectable backscatter are in
excellent agreement with theoretical values predicted prior to launch.
