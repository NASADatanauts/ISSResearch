Tetraethyl orthosilicate was hydrolyzed and polymerized in concentrated aqueous tetrapropylammonium (TPA)
hydroxide solution at 0 and 10 °C and room temperature. The formation of silicate oligomers involved in the
TPA-mediated self—assembly process of colloidal Silicalite-l was investigated using 29Si NMR. A pentacyclic
dodecamer with four edge-sharing ﬁve-rings on a four—ring was detected as a new intermediate in the formation
of Silicalite-l zeolite. The formation of this pentacyclic dodecamer with a curved inner hydrophobic silicon
dioxide surface is a new example of the structure-directing action of TPA. The temperature was found to be
a key parameter with respect to the transformation of the intermediates with 11 and 12 Si atoms. At 0 and 10
°C, the tetracyclic undecamer having three ﬁve-rings on a four—ring was converted into the pentacyclic
dodecamer by insertion of one additional silicate unit. At these low temperatures, it slowly underwent an
intramolecular condensation and formation of capped double ﬁve-ring not leading to Silicalite-l formation.
At room temperature, three pentacyclic dodecamers rapidly condensed into the Silicalite-l precursor. The
involvement of the pentacyclic dodecamer in the self—assembly process offers an explanation for the absence
of systematically missing T-sites in colloidal Silicalite-l.

On the basis of their experience with 2981 NMR of tetraalkyl- TPAOH solution, subsequently diluting by adding about 30 wt
ammonium silicate solutions, Kinrade et a1. discard the pos- % water, and heating to 100 °C.5 X-ray diffraction analysis of
