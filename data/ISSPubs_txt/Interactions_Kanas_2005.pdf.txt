Abstract
In isolated and conﬁned environments, two important leadership roles have been identiﬁed: the task/instrumental role
(which focuses on work goals and operational needs), and the supportive/expressive role (which focuses on morale goals and
emotional needs). On the International Space Station, the mission commander should be familiar with both of these aspects
of leadership. In previous research involving a 135-day Mir space station simulation in Moscow and a series of on-orbit
Mir space station missions during the Shuttle/Mir program, both these leadership roles were studied. In new analyses of
the Shuttle/Mir data, we found that for crewmembers, the supportive role of the commander (but not the task role) related
positively with crew cohesion. For mission control personnel on the ground, both the task and supportive roles of their leader
were related positively to mission control cohesion. The implications of these ﬁndings are discussed in terms of leadership
on board the International Space Station.
