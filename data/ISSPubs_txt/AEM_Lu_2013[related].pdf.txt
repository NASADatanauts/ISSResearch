ABSTRACT
To accommodate long duration biology research with rodent habitats on the International Space Station while providing
a healthy living and working environment for crewrnernbers, NASA Ames Research Center developed a new exhaust
ﬁlter for odor control for the Animal Enclosure Module (AEM), which houses mice and rats. The new exhaust ﬁlter
uses activated carbon pellets as adsorbents, with phosphoric acid (H3PO4) impregnated on the surface. The deodoriza—
tion performance of the new exhaust ﬁlters for AEM units housed with mice was evaluated. The ammonia breakthrough
time of the exhaust ﬁlters was also investigated. The results indicated that H3PO4 treated activated carbon exhibited a
high ammonia adsorption capacity of more than 90%. Furthermore, the new exhaust ﬁlter can effectively control the
odor from the AEM units for a 45 -day (minimum) ﬂight mission with a given animal biomass.
