Abstract
The ALTEA (Anomalous Long Term Effects in Astronauts) project is aimed at the study of the transient and long term effects of
cosmic particles on the astronauts’ cerebral functions. The detector will ﬂy on the International Space Station in 2005. Due to the
complexity of the detector (12 double silicon detector boxes arranged around the head of the astronaut) it is necessary to have a
detailed simulation of the apparatus response to cosmic ray nuclei in order to assess the detector response and its observational
capabilities. The ALTEA detector was therefore simulated by using the Geant 3.21 program, by the astronauts’ head described
by 64 cubes of water. By using Creme96 program to evaluate the cosmic rays ﬂuxes within the International Space Station we
obtained the events distribution and the energy lost in the cubes of water, as well as the expected interaction rates. Furthermore,
we calculated the triggered events number per unit of time in the detector. The simulation was also used to develop a technique
to recognize the cosmic rays nuclei.
