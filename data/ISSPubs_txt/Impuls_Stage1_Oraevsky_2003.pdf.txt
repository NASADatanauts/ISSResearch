Abstract—Phenomena accompanying the inj ection of a dense plasma beam from the payload of a rocket into
ionospheric plasma are analyzed. The dynamics of both the quasineutral plasma beam and the beam-induced
disturbances in the ionospheric plasma are investigated. It is shown that the electric ﬁeld in the beam has a com-
plicated structure, which leads to the generation of currents in both the beam and the ambient ionospheric
plasma. The transverse size of the disturbance zone in the ionospheric plasma is found to greatly exceed the
beam diameter. The proposed model of the current closing in the ionospheric plasma agrees well with the exper-
imental data. The xenon beam temperature at moderate distances from the inj ector is determined by using the
plasma shadow theory. It is found that the ion beam temperature is at least four times lower than the plasma
temperature in the injection zone. This unexpected result is explained by the adiabatic cooling of the current
system. The critical radius beyond which a constant temperature in the beam is established is found to be less
