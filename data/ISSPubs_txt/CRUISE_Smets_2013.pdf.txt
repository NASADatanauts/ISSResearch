3 Introduction
The CRUISE experiment focused on the comparison of Procedural Displays
(PD) and Voice Activated Procedure Viewer (vaPV) extensions of the Lapap
MK II software for supporting crew operations on-board. This experiment
provides insight in the effects of the support functions under on-orbit conditions
(e.g., microgravity and noise), on the user experience of the PD and vaPV
(ESR, 2012). This document specifies the evaluation measures, methods, plans
and evaluation findings.

3.1 Background

3. 1. 1 Procedural displa y
On-board, procedures are provided in electronic format with powerful tools
supporting their on-Iine use, paper versions are primarily kept for backup.
With the installation of LAPAP MK II on-board Columbus Operations Data File
(ODF) procedure execution is supported and enables crew members to activate
synoptic displays for carrying out command & control operations directly from
within procedures while executing them (LAPAP_CRU, 2012).
The objective of the PD study (2008) was to take this approach significantly
further by integrating command buttons and data fields directly with the
procedural contents. This enables not only a more efficient use of screen real
estate, but also supports a streamlined work flow, see Figure 1.

Prooedure + Bismil- = Prﬁgggmﬁl‘Display
Figure 1 PD integrates two different displays (procedure + display) into one display (Procedural
Display) (Eso-IT-RP-0668, 2013).

The PD software was also integrated into the user interface demonstrator for a
future European crew transport system. Figure 2 depicts this demonstrator with
the embedded PD component at the left side.

3.2 Description of test methods and goals

The CRUISE evaluation was not a controlled experiment with systematic

manipulations of experimental conditions and a sufficient number of participants

to apply inferential statistics. Consequently, we will not be able to draw

conclusions about the population the data are thought to represent. It will be a

qualitative assessment of the user experience in a real on-orbit environment,

with actual end-users (i.e. astronauts) performing high-fidelity scenarios. The
objective is to perform a first validation of the functions and claims and then be
able to provide recommendations for improvement.

3.2.1 User Experience Measures

First of all, as prescribed in human factors engineering standards (ECSS— ST-

10-110, ISO 9241-2102010), this assessment should comprise three types of

usability measures: effectiveness, efficiency and satisfaction.

Effectiveness (accuracy and completeness).

- For the Crusade evaluation scenarios, a normative performance should be
available: the actions to be completed.

Efficiency.

- Time per task should be measured.

- Corrections, repetitive acts and ""navigation path"": log file

- Rating Scale Mental Effort (RSME; Zijlstra, 1993)

Satisfaction.

° Questionnaire

In addition to complying with state-of—the-art usability standards, the CRUISE

user interfaces intend to support astronauts' task performance on trust, situation

awareness and context. Thus these measures are also taken into account.

Trust

° Questionnaire

Userexpeﬁence

- The general operational context: video recordings

- User state: questionnaire at start of experiment (""mood""). We will use the
Self—Assessment Manakin (SAM; Morris, 1995) questionnaire to assess the
participant’s emotional state and how pleasant the participants are feeling.

Situation awareness

Unobtrusive measurement of situation awareness is complex. In order to

prevent interference with the actual task execution, we chose for an indirect

measure:

- a questionnaire at the end of the scenario, asking for which events
appeared (""awareness"" about what happened in the environment) and how
these events were addressed (""awareness"" about the performance).

3.2.2 Core functions and claims explanation
For the PD and vaPV, the core functions were identified with the corresponding
claims using the situated Cognitve Engineering (sCE) method by Neerincx
(2011). The core functions (high-Ievel functional requirements) were derived
from the scenarios test definitions. The claims specify the measures (data) to
be collected during the evaluation and consist of upsides and downsides. The
trade-off in design is that in general the upsides are higher than the downsides,
this should be validated. A claim definition looks like:
- Claim (each variable should refer to definitions of measures!):
— <objective> constrained and efficient interaction,

— T <upsides> adequate completeness of task performance (do not
forget procedural step) less errors in parameter setting (e.g.,
temperature within set boundaries, outside boundaries is not possible,
as prescribed in procedure?),

— i<downsides> too much information presentation and superficial
procedure execution results in errors.

3.2.3 Core functions and claims for PD and vaPV
This paragraph describes the core functions and claims for the PD and vaPV:
- Core function PD:
— The integration of the synoptic displays with the procedure viewer,
merging a procedure (ODF) operations product with real-time system
data elements to support nominal ISS operations. (links to claim 1, 2, 3
and 4).
- Core function vaPV:
— Support for hands-busy procedure execution through voice input

technology. (links to claim 1, 4, 5 and 6).

- Claim 1
— PD and vaPV will enhance effectiveness, because the user will be guided
by the procedure viewer or voice activated procedure viewer.

— T Effectiveness will be more accurate and complete (compare to
normative path).

— i Trust, the astronaut might not trust these applications (questionnaire).

- Claim 2
— The PD’s integrated display will increase efficiency.
— T Efficiency (time per task, RSME).
- Claim 3
— The PD’s integrated display will improve awareness of procedural state
with relevant actions and corresponding conditions.
— T Better situation awareness (task specific SA questions).
- Claim 4
— The PD and vaPV will have a general positive effect on user satisfaction.
— T Satisfaction (questionnaire).
ONGERUBRICEERD

"
"9","ONGERUBRICEERD | TNO report | TNO 2013 R11379 9/25
- Claim 5
— The vaPV’s use of voice commands makes operation more efficient
(simultaneous execution of task and going through procedures)

— T Efficiency (time per task, RSME).

— i Satisfaction, poor recognition of voice commands (e.g. when
background noise is present) negatively influences the user
satisfaction (questionnaire).

- Claim 6
— The vaPV’s option to repeat procedure steps by voice will increase
awareness of procedural state with relevant and corresponding
conditions.
— T Better situation awareness (task specific SA questions).
— i Satisfaction, recognition of voice commands is never 100%, this
might influence the user satisfaction (questionnaire).

4 Test Plan
4.1 Test Procedure
Two astronauts conducted the (vaPV and PD) experiment one time on-orbit,
and two times on ground (pre- and post-mission). The pre-mission and on-orbit
session lasted approximately 45 (PD) and 65 (vaPV) minutes (experiment
installation: 80 minutes, 1 astronaut).The post—mission session lasted two
hours.
4.1.1 Pre-mission and on-orbit session
The pre-mission and on-orbit session had the same set-up. Except that the pre-
mission session included a training to get acquainted with the PD and vaPV.
Pre-mission, the PD and vaPV experiments were performed in the Columbus
mock-up at EAC.

Experiment ‘test’ (PD and vaPV) Pre-mission and on-orbit
Procedural displa y
Procedural Displays are displays with command and control capabilities.
They are displayed in the procedure execution area rather than in the synoptic
display area of the Lapap application. By directly embedding display elements
for data presentation and command execution they ensure a streamlined
workflow and optimize the use of screen real estate. Figure 4 shows the three
main areas of Procedural Displays:
1 Command and view control area.
contains buttons for starting and resetting a procedural display, for
centering the active instruction vertically in the main contents area
and for zooming.
2 Parameter selection area.
allows specifying parameter values for procedure execution, thereby
enabling the use of a single procedural display for common tasks
related to redundant, functionally identical pieces of equipment.
3 Main contents area.
This is where the actual procedural display is shown. In general the
PD appearance very much resembles ODF checklist procedures.
Command and control buttons and data fields are embedded within
procedure instructions. Steps and instructions are situated in the
center of the PD. At the right dedicated interaction buttons are
displayed for the active instruction if applicable. The active instruction
is highlighted with a light green bar similar to the one used for the
ODF procedure viewer. This bar turns to light blue for system
command instructions (before execution is initiated) and light orange
for failed verifications or system commands. On the left side an icon
gives feedback on status after an instruction was executed.

2013).

To demonstrate the specific capabilities of procedural displays, only procedures for

command and control tasks rather than for genuinely manual activities were

considered for selection. The selection was further restricted by excluding

procedures involving vital command and control actions. During the execution the

participant had to perform five Checklist procedures:

0 1.531 — CTCU ACTIVATION: activation of the Cabin Temperature Control Unit

0 1.602 — VENTING SYSTEM ACTIVATION: This procedure is used to activate
the Columbus Venting system.

0 1.606 — VENTING SYSTEM DEACTIVATION: This procedure is used to
deactivate the Columbus Venting system.

4.1.2 Post—mission session
In the post-mission session the participant went briefly through the Procedural
Display (PD) and voice activated Procedure Viewer (vaPV). The objective of this
session was to refresh the participant’s memory how the PD and vaPV worked, and
subsequently talk about the participant’s findings and opinions through
questionnaires and open discussion.
The participants were located in Houston Texas and were guided through the post-
mission session by the test leader by phone. The principal Investigators (PI) team
was present by phone as well. Also there was a local representative, that prepared
the session and print-outs for the post-mission session.
During the post-mission session the participant only executed a reduced number of
procedures with the PD. For the vaPV the participant did not perform procedures,
but assignments aimed at using the voice navigation commands. During the usage
and execution of the procedures or assignments, the participants were asked to
provide running commentary at certain points.
This request was provided in the procedure or assignment.
Running commentary was necessary to let the PI team know what was going on
and understand what the participant was doing since the PI team could not see the
participant’s laptop interaction.

5 Experiment results

First we will discuss the results from the pre-mission and on-orbit session.

These sessions can be compared because they are similar in set-up and execution.

At the end of the results section we will separately discuss the post mission

session, that had a different set-up.

5.1 Results from pre-mission and on-orbit sessions
5. 1. 1 General feedback

In addition to the user experience measures, we asked the participants about their

opinion of the PD and vaPV. We specifically asked them to list aspects that they

found positive, negative and to add further remarks.

We first list the positive and negative feedback on the PD.

Positive:

- Check marks at successful completion.

- Action on same line as direction.

0 Nice font.

0 Intuitive to work with.

Negative

- Feedback on selection using ‘white/gray’ is ambiguous.

- Being forced to acknowledge notes.

- Repeated identical entries cannot be changed.

- Have to be read; would be nice to listen instead.

We asked the participants for other remarks and suggestions:

A fresh opening of a procedure should have a clean template

Here is a list of the positive and negative feedback on the vaPV.

Positive:

- Hands off of display, can have too|s already in hand. (this comment was made
by both participants).

Negative:

- Cannot return to a step you departed from.

- Beeps when the vaPV is asleep, should be disabled.

- Cannot have a conversation with MCC or another crewmate without feedback of
vaPV.

- FaIIibIe, requires repeats of commands.

- Cannot jump to a photo and back without having to remember specific step
numbers.

We asked the participants for other remarks and suggestions:

- Participant A indicated that having a cord and headset is a drawback, and
suggests a wireless headset. Maybe use different commands: participant once
lost the whole procedure whi|e saying ‘baok’.

- Participant B suggested to get rid of earpiece and microphone. Use natural
words for commands (like asleep to turn off, wake up to turn on.

5.1.2 User experience measures

This paragraph describes the results of the user experience measures measured in

the experiments. Both PD and vaPV results will be discussed.

5.1.2.1 Effectiveness and efﬁciency

Table 3 shows usage data of the PD on-orbit session. The number of interactions is

exactly the same pre-mission as on-orbit. Differences can be seen in the time it took

to go through the procedures.

number of interactions (number of times participant clicked in PD screen) and time it
took the participant to go through the procedure in minutes and seconds.

Participant 1 pre-mission 81 15:20
Participant 1 on-orbit 81 10:14
Participant 2 pre-mission 81 05:49

Table 4 shows the usage data for the vaPV pre-mission and on-orbit mission for

both participants, where number of interactions means the number of times the

participant clicked something in the PD screen. In the pre-mission session the
participants did not actually perform the task, whereas in the on-orbit sessions they

did. This is why the on-orbit sessions took longer than the pre-mission sessions.

Recognition failures occurred when vaPV did not recognize the command spoken

by the participant, or recognized it for a wrong command than was spoken.

The data in the table shows that the number of recognition failures is higher for both

participants in the on-orbit session than in the pre-mission sessions.

Figure 6 graph showing mental effort of participants in different tests, where 0 = absolutely no
effort and 55 = rather much effort, (on-ground before, in space and on-ground after) for
the PD and vaPV.
The bar graph in Figure 6 shows the values that both participants filled in for their
mental effort. Where 25 means ‘a little effort’, 40 ‘some effort’ and 55 ‘rather much
effort’. For both participants the vaPV cost more effort on-orbit than pre-mission.
The PD is is valued the same by participant B, but participant A found that the PD
took a bit less effort on-orbit than in the pre-mission session.
5. 1.2.2 Satisfaction and trust
To get an indication of the user experience, satisfaction and trust, the participant
had to rate eight statements on a scale from 1 (totally disagree) to 5 (totally agree).
The statements were:
1 I found the program easy to use.
2 I trusted the information the program gave me.
3 I found the program pleasant to use.
4 I was satisfied with the way the program worked.
5 The program is truthful.
6 I found the program reliable.
7 I found the information offered by the program useful.
8 The information was offered at the right time.
Participant A rated the PD lower on ease of use on-orbit than in the pre-mission
session. Participant B rated the reliability of the PD lower on-orbit than in the pre-
mission session. Participant B rated the usefulness of information offered by the PD
and offered at the right time, higher on-orbit than in the pre-mission session.

To get an indication of the user’s trust in the PD and vaPV we asked them if they
trusted the program. They answered the question on a 5-point Likert scale (1 =
totally disagree and 5 = totally agree). The graph shows that the trust in the PD is
higher for both participants than trust in the vaPV. The trust in the PD was higher
on-orbit for participant B and lower on-orbit for participant A. Participant B had high
trust in the vaPV pre-mission, it was lower on-orbit.

5.2 Post-mission session

Here the results from the post-mission session are reported.
5.2.1 General feedback

We asked the participants about their opinion of the PD and vaPV. We specifically

asked them to list aspects that they found positive, negative and to add further

remarks.

We first list the positive and negative feedback on the PD.

Positive:

- Overall simple interface (mentioned by both participants).

- One source for procedure control and relevant data.

- Fast.

Negative:

- If a mistake is made, the participants had no way of knowing where he was in
the process and what the big picture is. The application is leading the
participant by the hand so much he loses the big picture (mentioned by both
participants).

We asked the participants for other remarks and suggestions:

- Have a display next to this one (for situation awareness).

Here is a list of the positive and negative feedback on the vaPV.

Positive:

- Hands free possibilities are excellent (mentioned by both participants).

- Relatively quick response to commands, and usually get correct results.

- Don’t have to fiddle with zero G cursor control devices (there are no good zero-
G cursor control devices).

Negative:

- Being attached by a headset to the laptop (mentioned by both participants).

- The feedback system (audio) could be in a different form instead of through the
earpiece.

We asked the participants for other remarks and suggestions:

- Each time the participants wakes vaPV up, don’t have vaPV say ‘hello user’.
Just make it simple, have the icon of vaPV turn green.

6 Conclusion

6.1 Discussion of claims
First we will discuss the results with respect to the claims we formulated.
The mental effort when using vaPV increases for both participants when on-orbit as
opposed to pre-mission values. Also the number of failures increase when using the
vaPV on-orbit. The vaPV is thus not in a state that it possible to say anything about
vaPV making operation more efficient or not (claim 5). Although a big advantage for
efficiency, is that when doing a hands-on job, the tools can already be taken in
hand while going to the procedure. This difference is not seen in the use of the PD.
The effectiveness and efficiency data for PD shows that both participants need to
same number of interactions. There is some time differences between on-ground an
on-orbit operation of the PD. It cannot be said with certainty that the PD enhances
effectiveness and efficiency (claim 1 and 2).
In general the satisfaction and trust values are higher for PD than for vaPV. For the
differences between sessions, nothing much can be said, because these
satisfaction and trust measures, measure a moment in time and the differences are
too small to draw conclusions. But it shows that the PD has a more positive effect
on user satisfaction than vaPV (claim 4). This is also what is seen in the subjective
feedback by the participants.
The feedback from the participants on PD show that the SA is actually worse (Claim
3), they have no idea where they are operating in the bigger picture. Fearing that if
something might go wrong with the application, they have no idea where they were
or how to cope with it. This shows that the PD has to be improved to support SA, by
perhaps adding an extra display as was suggested by the astronauts themselves.
The voice recognition on-orbit was poor. This was because of change of voice on-
orbit due to constant congestion of sinuses and lack of gravity and feedback from
vaPV when talking to orewmates. This made interaction difficult. An increase of
awareness of procedural state and conditions was not seen (claim 6).

6.2 General conclusions
Upsides of the PD were that it is an overall simple interface, with one source for
procedure control and relevant data and it is fast. Downside was found in the results
on the situation awareness questions, they showed that if there is a situation where
they have to get back to a previous task state, memory support is needed and an
overview for possible deviations from the current procedure. This is also confirmed
by the feedback in the post-mission session by the participants.
The biggest upside of the vaPV was the hands free possibility while executing
hands-on procedures. One of the big downsides of the vaPV was having the crew
member “tethered” to the laptop (especially on-board) in order to operate the vaPV
system. Suggested improvements to the vaPV were to capture the audio and
communicate to the system using wireless technology, either WiFi or Bluetooth.

Crew members also expressed a preference for systems that do not require them to
wear an earpiece or in any case not to have both ears covered by a headset.
Audio communications from the laptop to the crew member could be provided via
the laptop speakers.
In general the PD is more appreciated than the vaPV. Upsides of the hands-free
voice control were noted, but downsides of speech dialogue are still rather large.
This was particularly shown on-orbit. These results show the importance of a test in
a realistic and high-fidelity setting.

2. Specific questions:
What should you take into account when starting the CTCU activation
procedure?
Answer:
The cabin temperature may need time to stabilize to the nominal
temperature range. The delta temperature between the 3 sensors must not
be greater than 1.5 degC. If the cabin temperature is out of the expected
values, retry this step Within one hour. Rational: for most cases one hour is
sufﬁcient for the CTCU to attain nominal operation temperature.
What is the objective of the cabin temperature setting procedure?
Answer:
This procedure is used to Change the cabin temperature set-point of the
active Cabin
Temperature Control Unit (CTCU). The set-point can be selected between
18 degC and 27
