Abstract—Crystals of E. coli purine nucleoside phosphorylase were grown in microgravity by the capillary
counter— diffusion method through a gel layer. The X—ray diffraction data set suitable for the determination of
the three—dimensional structure at atomic resolution was collected from one crystal at the Spring—S synchro—
tron facility to 0.99 A resolution. The crystals belong to sp. gr. P21 and have the following unit—cell parameters:
a = 74.1 A, b = 110.2 A, c = 88.2 A, on = y = 900, [3 = 111.080. The crystal contains siX subunits ofthe enzyme
comprising a hexamer per asymmetric unit. The hexamer is the biological active form of E. coli. purine nucle—
oside phosphorylase.
