As part of the international Matroshka-R and Radi-N experiments, bubble detectors have been used on board the ISS in 8

order to characterise the neutron dose and the energy spectrum of neutrons. Experiments using bubble dosemeters inside a a

tissue-equivalent phantom were performed during the 188-16, 188-18 and ISS-19 expeditions. During the 188-20 and ISS-21 g

missions, the bubble dosemeters were supplemented by a bubble-detector spectrometer, a set of siX detectors that was used to 03

determine the neutron energy spectrum at various locations inside the ISS. The temperature-compensated spectrometer set 2,

used is the ﬁrst to be developed speciﬁcally for space applications and its development is described in this paper. Results of $3ZD

the dose measurements indicate that the dose received at two different depths inside the phantom is not signiﬁcantly different, 3*-

suggesting that bubble detectors worn by a person provide an accurate reading of the dose received inside the body. The g

energy spectra measured using the spectrometer are in good agreement with previous measurements and do not show a strong E

dependence on the precise location inside the station. To aid the understanding of the bubble-detector response to charged 3.

particles in the space environment, calculations have been performed using a Monte-Carlo code, together with data collected a

0n the ISS. These calculations indicate that charged particles contribute <2% t0 the bubble count on the ISS, and can there- 3

fore be considered as negligible for bubble-detector measurements in space. 9a
