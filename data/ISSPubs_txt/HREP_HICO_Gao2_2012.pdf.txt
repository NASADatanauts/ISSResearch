The Hyperspectral Imager for the Coastal Ocean (HICO) presently onboard the International Space Sta-
tion (188) is an imaging spectrometer designed for remote sensing of coastal waters. The instrument is
not equipped with any onboard spectral and radiometric calibration devices. Here we describe Vicarious
calibration techniques that have been used in converting the HICO raw digital numbers to calibrated
radiances. The spectral calibration is based on matching atmospheric water vapor and oxygen absorption
bands and extraterrestrial solar lines. The radiometric calibration is based on comparisons between
HICO and the EOS/MODIS data measured over homogeneous desert areas and on spectral reﬂectance
properties of coral reefs and water clouds. Improvements to the present Vicarious calibration techniques
are possible as we gain more in-depth understanding of the HICO laboratory calibration data and the ISS
HICO data in the future. © 2012 Optical Society of America
