Abstract
Biochips are promising instruments for the search for organic molecules in planetary environments. Nucleic acid
aptamers are powerful affinity receptors known for their high affinity and specificity, and therefore are of great
interest for space biochip development. A wide variety of aptamers have already been selected toward targets of
astrobiological interest (from amino acids to microorganisms). We present a first study to test the resistance of
these receptors to the constraints of the space environment. The emphasis is on the effect of cosmic rays on the
molecular recognition properties of DNA aptamers. Experiments on bearn-line facilities have been conducted
with 2 MeV protons and ﬂuences much higher than expected for a typical mission to Mars. Our results show that
this irradiation process did not affect the performances of DNA aptamers as molecular recognition tools. Key
