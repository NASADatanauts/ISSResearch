INTRODUCTION: Postﬂight postural ataxia reﬂects both the control strategies adopted for movement in microgravity and the direct
effects of deconditioning. Computerized dynamic posturography (CDP) has been used during the ﬁrst decade of the
International Space Station (ISS) expeditions to quantify the initial postﬂight decrements and recovery of postural
stability.

METHODS: The CDP data were obtained on 37 crewmembers as part oftheir pre- and postﬂight medical examinations. Sensory
organization tests evaluated the ability to make effective use of (or suppress inappropriate) visual, vestibular, and
somatosensory information for balance contro|.This report focuses on eyes closed conditions with either a ﬁxed or
sway—referenced base of support, with the head erect or during pitch—head tilts (: 20° at 0.33 Hz). Equilibrium scores
were derived from peak—to—peak anterior-posterior sway. Motor-control tests were also used to evaluate a crewmem-
ber’s ability to automatically recover from unexpected support-surface perturbations.

RESULTS: The standard Romberg condition was the least sensitive. Dynamic head tilts led to increased incidence of falls and
revealed signiﬁcantly longer recovery than head-erect conditions. Improvements in postﬂight postural performance
during the later expeditions may be attributable to higher preﬂight baselines and/or advanced exercise capabilities
aboard the ISS.

CONCLUSIONS: The diagnostic assessment of postural instability is more pronounced during unstabIe-support conditions requiring
active head movements. In addition to supporting return-to—duty decisions by ﬂight surgeons, the CDP provides a
standardized sensorimotor measure that can be used to evaluate the effectiveness of countermeasures designed to
either minimize deconditioning on orbit or promote reconditioning upon return to Earth.
