With much of their time committed to constructing ""' -'-'
the International Space Station, astronauts and
cosmonauts are also beginning their ﬁrst scientiﬁc
studies. The Destiny Laboratory just joined to the
International Space Station includes the best optical
quality Window ever ﬂown on a human-occupied
spacecraft. The Window Will eventually host a number
of remote sensing experiments mounted on a special
rack system, the Window Observational Research
Facility 0r WORF, for mechanical and electrical
support (Eppler et a1. 1996). Until the WORF is
complete in June 2002, astronauts are photographing
the Earth’s surface as part of an early proj ect, called
Crew Earth Observations.

Even as such satellites have become the most

humans have continued to look out the Windows of
