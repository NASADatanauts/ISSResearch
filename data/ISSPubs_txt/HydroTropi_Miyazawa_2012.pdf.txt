60 results, it is considered that MlZ1 could be a key molecule
that regulates the auxin content in roots and thus regulates
50 the degree of hydrotropic root bending. To date, many genes
733‘ 40 have been discovered to be involved in the auxin biosynthetic
9;, pathway (Mano and Nemoto 2012). In addition, possible inhibi—
£3, tors of auxin biosynthesis have been reported (Soeno et al.
g 30 2010). Use of knockout mutants of auxin biosynthesis genes
27 20 or inhibitors of auxin biosynthesis might provide a clue to clar—
5 ify the above—mentioned hypothesis.
10 In summary, it is suggested that MIZ1 may act at early stages
of the hydrotropic response, and its overexpression can not
