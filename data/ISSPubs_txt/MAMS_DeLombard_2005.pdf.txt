The International Space Station (ISS) serves as a platform for microgravity research for
the foreseeable future. A microgravity environment is one in which the effects of gravity are
drastically reduced which then allows physical experiments to be conducted without the
overpowering effects of gravity. During his six month stay on the ISS, astronaut Donald R.
Pettit performed many informal / impromptu science experiments with available equipment.
One such experiment focused on the motion of air bubbles in a rectangular container nearly
ﬁlled with de-ionized water. Bubbles were introduced by shaking and then the container was
secured in place for several hours while motion of the bubbles were recorded using time-
lapse photography. This paper shows correlation between bubble motion and quasi-steady
acceleration levels during one such experiment operation. The quasi-steady acceleration
vectors were measured by the Microgravity Acceleration Measurement System. Essentially
linear motion was observed in the condition considered here. Dr. Pettit also created other
conditions which produced linear and circulating motion, which are the subjects of further
study. Initial observations of this bubble motion agree with calculations from many
microgravity physical science experiments conducted on Shuttle microgravity science
missions. Many crystal-growth furnaces involve heavy metals and high temperatures in
which undesired acceleration-driven convection during solidiﬁcation can adversely affect the
crystal. Presented in this paper will be results showing correlation between bubble motion
and the quasi-steady acceleration vector.

I. Background & Related Work
A. ISS quasi—steady microgravity environment

The microgravity environment of an orbiting spacecraft such as the International Space Station (ISS) is not
simply “zero G” as is popularly assumed. Although not ideal, the closest to “zero G” on the ISS would be
experienced by an article ﬂoating in mid—air at the center of mass of the ISS. Any other article attached to the
vehicle will experience Vibrations (accelerations) from a variety of sources, such as pumps, fans, ISS attitude
control, atmospheric drag, gravity gradient, and others. These disturbances are transmitted mechanically through the
vehicle structure and acoustically through the air in the habitable modules. The spectrum of Vibrations is comprised
of a variety of frequencies from steady to 300 Hz across the range which can disturb physical science experiments.
The magnitude of these Vibrations varies with frequency ranging from 1X10""5 m/s2 at low—frequencies to 1X10""1 m/s2
at higher frequencies. Since the lower acceleration levels are approximately one—millionth of Earth’s l—g (~ 9.8
m/s2), this environment is referred to as “microgravity.”

The ISS quasi—steady microgravity environment is comprised of those accelerations at or below a frequency of
0.01 Hz or with a period greater than 100 seconds. These accelerations are caused primarily by atmospheric drag,
gravity gradient forces, vehicle motions, and venting.1’ 2’ 3’ 4 The magnitudes of accelerations in this low—frequency
regime generally do not exceed 2X10""5 m/s2 under normal operations during which physical science experiments are
conducted.3 These quasi—steady accelerations are, in general, unique for different locations on a vehicle since the
quasi—steady acceleration levels depend on the direction and distance from the vehicle’s center of mass.

B. ISS attitude and orientation affect on the acceleration environment

The quasi—steady acceleration experienced at a particular location on an orbital vehicle is dependent on many
factors including atmospheric drag (and its myriad of subordinate factors, such as atmospheric density and vehicle
altitude), the vehicle attitude relative to its ﬂight path, and the distance of that location from the center of mass of the
vehicle. For a treatment of this topic relative to quasi—steady (and other) accelerations, see reference 4.

The ISS ﬂight attitude is deﬁned according to the attitude control reference system. While the subject bubble
motion experiments were conducted, the ISS vehicle was oriented with its X aXis perpendicular to the orbital plane
(XPOP) with the Z—aXis aligned at orbital noon.3 This attitude develops a nearly sinusoidal time—varying acceleration
signature in the quasi—steady frequency regime illustrated in Figure 1. These time—varying accelerations arise from
the vehicle’s rotation and the variable atmospheric drag through the day/night cycle of the orbit. The rotation of the
vehicle relative to its orbital path causes centripetal acceleration and varies the gravity gradient acceleration levels.
The sinusoidal signals of the Y—aXis and Z—aXis accelerations are approximately 90 degrees apart which, with the
relatively constant X—aXis acceleration, creates a spiral pattern of three—dimensional acceleration. Plotting the
measured acceleration levels as three two—dimensional histograms, Figure 2, illustrates the circular nature of the
acceleration.5

"3","C. Related past investigations

Companion projects for measuring the microgravity environment and analyzing the resultant data have been
operating in the NASA physical science program for over ﬁfteen years. The Space Acceleration Measurement
System, the MicrograVity Acceleration Measurement System (MAMS), and the Principal Investigator Microgravity
Services (PIMS) and their antecedent projects have been providing principal investigators with information about
the microgravity environment before, during, and after the principal investigators’ experiment operations.

The direction of the quasi—steady acceleration and its dependence on vehicle attitude have been utilized for
materials science experiments on several Space Transportation System (STS) missions. Several of the samples
processed in the Crystal Growth Furnace (CGF) for investigations on the first United States MicrograVity
Laboratory (USML—l) on the STS—SO mission in 1992 required the Orbiter to maintain a specific attitude to
maximize the alignment of the quasi—steady acceleration vector with the cylindrical—sample orientation.6 The
mission planning incorporated three time intervals with the Orbiter in speciﬁc orientations while the samples were
processed in the CGF to minimize disturbances by the quasi—steady acceleration levels.

On the STS—SO mission, a Passive Accelerometer System (PAS) measured the quasi—steady acceleration levels on
the Orbiter.7 The PAS hardware consisted of a cylinder ﬁlled with water and a single steel ball. Using initial trials,
the crew members were able to align the cylinder with the average quasi—steady acceleration so the steel ball would
traverse the cylinder. Measurement of the steel ball’s position over time gave a measure of the g—level at that
location and Orbital attitude. Unfortunately, the acceleration vector does not have a constant direction for long and
the steel ball was observed to ‘run into the wall.’ This adversely affected the ball’s speed along the cylinder and
therefore the measurement of the acceleration magnitude.

The acceleration direction dependence on Orbiter attitude was also utilized in 1996 during the STS—75 mission
with a materials science investigation within the third United States MicrograVity Payload (USMP—3). The
investigation Compound Semiconductor Growth in a Low-g Environment was conducted in the Advanced
Automated Directional Solidiﬁcation Furnace (AADSF), a multi—zone directional solidification furnace.8 The
investigation’s purpose was to “determine how gravity—driven convection affects the composition of alloys where
convection is driven by both thermal and compositional gradients.” This investigation included three experiment
samples in order to grow three separate crystals under differing microgravity acceleration environment conditions.
One sample would be processed with the quasi—steady acceleration vector aligned with the direction of growth along
the length of the sample, one sample would be processed with the quasi—steady acceleration vector aligned opposite
to the direction of growth, and one would be processed with the quasi—steady acceleration vector aligned
perpendicular to the direction of growth. Extensive modeling calculations9 were done before and after the mission to
ensure the Orbiter attitude was properly deﬁned to result in the desired acceleration vector direction.

Since these investigators were primarily interested in the direction of the quasi—steady acceleration vector as
opposed to the speciﬁc magnitude, a novel acceleration direction indicator was proposed.10 This indicator utilizes a
bubble or particle (or both) suspended in a liquid to Visually indicate the direction of the quasi—steady acceleration
vector. This deVice was enVisioned to provide a simple, low—cost, and direct measurement of the acceleration vector
direction in support of users.

11. Experiment Setup

Astronaut Dr. Donald Pettit began a series of informal activities he called Saturday Morning Science while he
was on—board the 188 as the 188 Science Ofﬁcer from November 23, 2002 to May 3, 2003. In the Saturday Morning
Science activities“, Dr. Pettit used equipment and supplies available on—board the 188 such as food, wire, water,
shampoo, locking plastic bags, soldering irons, bolts, compact disk players, and cameras.

Dr. Pettit had studied particle motion2 in microgravity and conferred with Dr. J . Iwan Alexander several times
about the PAS which has ﬂown twice on microgravity Shuttle missions. In preparation for his work on 188 during
Increment 6, Dr. Pettit brought several plastic culture ﬂasks in his personal kit specifically to do experiments
without knowing how he might use them. It was fortuitous that he included a 250 ml polycarbonate culture ﬂask
with plane—parallel walls of optical quality. On orbit, all these ideas came together and the bubble motion experiment
using time lapsed Video was possible.

The 250 ml ﬂask was 120 mm long X 70 mm wide X 29.5 mm thick. The ﬂask was ﬁlled with 200 ml of ISS
drinking water and 0.1 ml of shampooll from the crew supplies. The shampoo was added to help keep the bubbles
from coalescing. The ﬂask was manually agitated to produce a variety of bubbles inside. The ﬂask was then
mounted on an adjustable camera arm in front of a dark blue cloth (crew tee shirt) to enhance Visibility by the Video

adjusted for slow motion photography to acquire one—half second (ﬁfteen frames) of Video every thirty seconds. This
apparatus was then left in place for several hours to enable the bubble motion to be observed over one or two orbits
of the 188.

Dr. Pettit performed these operations over several days in the rack locations and 188 orbital attitudes listed in
Table l. Acceleration data was collected for nearly all of these intervals of experimentation. Unfortunately, the data
for the ISS vehicle motions is not acquired continuously and therefore the coverage is ‘spotty’ for these time
intervals. The best conditions of interesting bubble motion, continuous MAMS data, and adequate vehicle data was
for the experiment done on December 19, 2002 from Greenwich Mean Time (GMT) 00:32 to 03:32. GMT is the
standard time used by the 188 Program for mission events.

111. Analysis Methods

Motion of the bubbles in the digital Video frames were digitized with Spotlight, a NASA Glenn—developed,
image—analysis software tool”. The position data in pixels were then related to 18$ mission time according to the
time recorded on the digital Video tape. The bubble position in pixels for the experiment was converted to
millimeters using on—orbit calibration Video as explained above.

The quasi—steady acceleration data were obtained from the MAMS — Orbital Acceleration Research Experiment
Sensor System (MAMS—OSS). These low—frequency acceleration data are most often used for long spans of time,
namely days or weeks. Vehicle motions (rotations and/or translations) introduce low—frequency accelerations which
are dependent on the distance and direction from the vehicle center of mass and the nature of the vehicle motion. In
the present case, the MAMS instrument was approximately two meters from the bubble motion experiment sites.
The MAMS—OSS data was transformed from the MAMS location to the experiment sites using standard PIMS
processes (see Appendix E.2.2 of Reference 3 for more details). The processed MAMS data is oriented according to
the 188 Analysis coordinate system.

IV. Bubble motion and acceleration levels on GMT day 353, 2002

Figure 3 illustrates the bottle orientation for this experiment in relation to the right—handed 188 Analysis
coordinate system (XA, YA, ZA). The position of three bubbles labeled A, B, and C were tracked through Video
frames spanning three hours with the resultant bubble motion tracks shown in Figure 4. The X and Z components of
this motion compared with the corresponding MAMS—OSS quasi—steady accelerations are shown in Figure 5. The Z
aXis position decreases when the Z aXis acceleration is greatest (e.g. t = 0.4 hr) and that motion essentially stops
when the acceleration approaches zero (e.g. t = 0.7 hr).

The X axis motion is primarily a steady movement driven by the nearly constant X aXis acceleration component
and limited by the terminal velocity of the bubble in water. The estimated terminal velocity of air bubble A, of
diameter 2.4 mm +/—0.2 mm, is roughly 13 mm/hr. This compares well with the measured velocity of 11.2 mm/hr
for the ﬁrst 2.5 hours of Figure 5. The theoretical terminal velocity includes a correction term for small Reynolds
number, but does not reﬂect the effect of bulk ﬂuid ﬂow in the system, nor the interaction of the bubble with
boundaries and other bubbles.

Motion in the Y axis direction is difﬁcult to interpret from these Video segments, since this motion would need to
be measured by the change in apparent size of the bubble as it moved closer to and farther from the camera. These
small bubbles measure about 10 pixels in diameter which makes accurate measurements of the changing bubble size
essentially impossible. Bubble C (Figure 3) was chosen for observation because of its actions when it moves
adjacent to the large bubble in the corner. At t = 2.1 hr, the Y aXis acceleration forces the small bubble away from
the camera but motion in that direction is blocked by the large bubble. The resultant motion of the small bubble is
then along the periphery of the large bubble and is seen here as motion in the —X and —Z directions. When the Y aXis
acceleration reverses at t = 2.4 hr, this motion of the small bubble along the periphery of the large bubble is reversed
and the small bubble goes in the +X direction again.

Figure 5 shows the X—Z plane acceleration levels superimposed on the motion of the bubbles. This illustrates the
correlation between the acceleration and the bubble motion except for bubble C when the Y aXis acceleration
inﬂuences its motion near the large bubble (as explained above).

V. Further study

Dr. Pettit acquired interesting Video of bubble motions in microgravity, not all of which has been analyzed to
date. Attempts will be made to further correlate other Video sequences with acceleration and vehicle data in the
future. Difﬁculties eXist in the aforementioned lack of vehicle orientation data and occasional missing MAMS—OSS

the spiral motion of the acceleration vector during XPOP. Another interesting sequence shows bubbles moving
vertically (transverse to the direction reported here).
VI. Summary
Scientists have long expressed concerns for the inﬂuence the low—level, low—frequency quasi—steady acceleration
may have on experiments which contain a density difference. This informal experiment Video has shown the direct
correlation between air bubble motion in a container of water when inﬂuenced by acceleration levels of less than
one—millionth 0f 1—g. This illustrates the effects which occur in high temperature materials experiments (for
example) where these low—level, low—frequency accelerations cause motion due to the ﬂuid density differences.
