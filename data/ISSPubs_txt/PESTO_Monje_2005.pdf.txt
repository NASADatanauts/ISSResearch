Abstract Plant stand gas exchange was measured nondestructively in microgravity during the
Photosynthesis Experiment Subsystem Testing and Operations experiment conducted onboard the
International Space Station. Rates of evapotranspiration and photosynthesis measured in space were
compared with ground controls to determine if microgravity directly affects whole—stand gas exchange
of Triticum aestivum. During six 21—day experiment cycles, evapotranspiration was determined
continuously from water addition rates to the nutrient delivery system, and photosynthesis was
determined from the amount of C02 added to maintain the Chamber C02 concentration setpoint. Plant
stand evapotranspiration, net photosynthesis, and water use efficiency were not altered by microgravity.
Although leaf area was significantly reduced in mierogravity—grown plants compared to ground control
plants, leaf area distribution was not affected enough to cause significant differences in the amounts of
light absorbed by the ﬂight and ground control plant stands. Microgravity also did not affect the
response of evapotranspiration to changes in Chamber vapor pressure difference of 12—day—old wheat
plant stands. These results suggest that gravity na'1've plants grown at moderate light levels (300 In mol
m—2 s‘l) behave the same as ground control plants. This implies that future plant—based regenerative
life support systems can be sized using 1 g data because water purification and food production rates
operate at nearly the same rates as in 1 g at moderate light levels. However, it remains to be verified
whether the present results are reproducible in plants grown under stronger light levels.

Introductlon

The manned exploration of space will employ plant—based bioregenerative life support systems to
reliably assimilate C02, produce 02, provide food, and recycle water for human crews living in
microgravity aboard spacecraft or in planetary bases (Olson et al. 1988; Wheeler et al. 200]). T hus, a
fundamental understanding of how plants and ecosystems respond to prolonged exposures to reduced
gravity forces (Earth—l g, Mars—3/ 8 g, Moon— 1/6 g, and spacecraft—mierogravity) found in space,
is needed (Monje et al. 2003). Experiments examining the responses of plant stand evapotranspiration
(ET) and photosynthesis (Pnet) to the absence of gravity may help us determine whether these key
metabolic processes are gravity dependent, and also help identify what countermeasures can be adopted
to ensure normal plant growth and development in space. Studying responses of ET and Pnet to
microgravity is important because Changes in these rates impact the size of the growing area required
for plant—based life support systems (Wheeler et al. 200] ; Salisbury 1991), and may also impact species
composition in spaceborne ecosystems (Morey—Holton 2003).

Presently, fundamental research exploring longterm plant growth and development in space can only be
conducted aboard the International Space Station (188). However, mass, volume and power constraints
of spaceﬂight experiments often limit the ability to control the environment in which the plants are
grown, so that plant responses to environmental Changes can not be easily separated from plant
responses elicited solely by the absence of gravity (Cook and Cronale 2003). In past spaceﬂight
experiments, plant growth rates in microgravity have been generally observed to be less than ground
controls (Halstead and Dutcher I984; Porterfield 2002), but recent spaceﬂight plant studies suggest that
differences between spaceﬂight—grown and 1 g—grown plants may be caused indirectly, through
mierogravity—mediated plant stresses. Plant stress in space may result from waterlogging due to
moisture redistribution in the rootzone compared to 1 g (Bingham et al. 1996; J ones and Or 1998), or
from inadequate supply of C02 and 02 to plant organs caused by insufficient ventilation coupled with
the absence of buoyancy driven convection (Musgrave et al. 1997; Porterfield et al. 1997; Ferl et al.
2002; Porterfield 2002). Other factors related to conducting plant experiments aboard spacecraft, such
as exposure to high ethylene concentrations (Klassen and Bugbee 2002; Stutte 1999), growth at
elevated C02 concentrations (Wheeler et al. 1999; Monje and Bugbee I998), ﬂuctuating environmental
parameters of spacecraft cabin air (Levinskikh et al. 2000; Monje et al. 2000), and exposures to volatile
organic compounds with biogenie activity (Stutte I999; Stutte and Wheeler 1997) may also affect plant
stand gas exchange rates indirectly through morphological Changes in plant size and leaf area. T hus,
differences in plant growth rates observed in space compared to 1 g controls cannot be solely attributed
to direct effects of microgravity on metabolism when the ﬂight hardware employed provides variable,
suboptimal or uncontrolled environmental conditions for growth.

Recent advances in the design of spaceﬂight plant growth hardware have allowed tighter environmental
control compared to previous experiments (Morrow and Crabb 2000; Musgrave 2002; Monje et al.
2003), thereby allowing longterm studies to examine what, if any, direct effects the lack of gravity may
have on plant growth. In this study, it was hypothesized that gravity would have no direct impact on
plant gas exchange rates (ET and Pnet), because they are driven by gradients of partial pressure
between leaves and the air surrounding them. This hypothesis was tested during the 73—day long

"
"3","PESTO experiment aboard the 188. Several wheat crops were grown in three controlled environment
Chambers of the Biomass Production System spaceﬂight hardware during identical spaceﬂight and
ground control experiments. Rates of plant stand ET and Pnet were measured nondestructively using
gas exchange methods in siX replicate 21—day—10ng experiments and the rates from microgravity grown
plants were compared with ground (1 g) controls.

Materials and methods

Spaceflight hardware

The Biomass Production System (BPS; Orbitee, Madison, W1) is a shuttle middeek locker— sized plant
growth unit. It provides four plant growth Chambers (PGCs) composed of a light bank, Chamber walls
and a root module. Each PGC permits independent monitoring and control of air temperature, relative
humidity, light level, C02 concentration, and rootzone matrie potential. The plant Chambers are
removable for on—orbit access to plants for sampling and harvest. Light in each PGC is provided by
cool white ﬂuorescent lamps, and ethylene is removed by a photoeatalytie T iO2 scrubber. Each PGC
has 0.0264 m2 of ground area with 13—em tall Chamber walls and a 3—Cm deep root module. The root
module is separated from the aerial portion of the Chamber by a foam cover and a manifold to circulate
air. Water is supplied to the substrate Via three porous tubes by a metered peristaltic pump in order to
maintain a constant root zone matrie potential. PESTO was conducted in PGCs 1—3 of the BPS. The 4th
PGC was planted with Brassicca rapa as part of a separate hardware validation test (Morrow et a1.
2001 ; Iverson et a1. 2003).

Spaceflight activities

The BPS was loaded with live plants 4 days before launch. One day before launch the BPS was
transferred to the middeek—loeker 0f Shuttle Endeavour. BPS was launched from the Kennedy Space
Center during the STS—110/8A mission on April 8, 2002. It remained on Endeavor until it was
transferred to the 188 011 April 12, 2002, and was installed onto EXPRESS Rack 4 0f the Destiny
module. The BPS was tended by Payload Engineer Dan Burseh, who was responsible for on—orbit
Operations including imbibing pre—planted root modules, tissue fixation, and plant harvests. Data and
near real—time Video from inside the growth Chambers was transmitted from BPS to Earth Via the Ames
T eleseienee Center using the Communication and Data System (CDS V1.02). The BPS returned to
Earth 011 June 19, 2002 011 STS—111/UF—2 (Edwards Air Force Base landing). The total on—orbit
duration for the BPS was 73 days.

Cultural conditions

Wheat (Triticum aestivum L., CV. USU Apogee) is a high yielding dwarf variety (40 cm tall) suited for
growth in controlled environments because it is half the height of normal wheat (Bugbee and Koerner
1997). Apogee was Chosen for the experiment because its gas exchange rates at high C02
concentrations had been Characterized (Monje and Bugbee 1998), it grew rapidly, and did not have a
vernalization requirement for germination. Each PESTO root module was packed with ~500 g of

T urfaee (calcined montmorillonite Clay sifted to 1—2 mm) mixed with Osmoeote (7 g 1‘1 or 12 g kg—1 of
substrate) slow release fertilizer. The root modules contained 32 wheat plants seeded in four rows at a
planting density of 1200 plants In—2 (Stutte et a1. 2000). This corresponded to planting densities used in

"
"4","large— scale (20 n1 ) controlled environment tests in the Biomass Production Chamber (BPC) at the
Kennedy Space Center (Wheeler et a1. 2003). Pre—planted root modules were removed from stowage,
imbibed until saturated using a syringe (~540 m1), and placed in the BPS by the payload engineer. The
root zone matrie potential (suction) was —0.30 kPa, which equals a hydrostatic head of —3.0 cm
measured at the center the root module. Light in each PGC was provided by a bank of cool white
ﬂuorescent lamps.

The PESTO experiment had three plantings: (1) plants germinated at 1—g and launched, (2) plants
germinated and grown entirely in microgravity, and (3) plants germinated and grew in microgravity that
landed. The root modules of the 1st planting were imbibed 0n the ground (1 g) and the remaining ones
were imbibed in microgravity. The plants germinated and grew at a photosynthetic photon ﬂux (PPF)
of ~280 lu mol n1‘2 s‘1 (measured at the top of the chamber), and a photoperiod 0f 20 h day/4 h night.
During the each 21—day planting, the relative humidity and air temperature setpoints were 75% and
24°C, respectively. Ethylene concentration was maintained at <50 nmol m01‘1 by a photoeatalytie
scrubber. Daytime C02 concentration was not allowed to fall below 1500150 In mol m01‘1, however, it
took ~1—2 h to decrease from the night time value when the lights were turned 011 depending on plant
age. This drawdown at the beginning of each day allowed a secondary measure of canopy gas
exchange. The 3rd planting allowed measurements of leaf area and absorbed PPF from 23—day—old
ﬂight and ground control plants upon landing.

Ground control experiment

The ground control experiment was started on Earth two weeks after the launch in an identical BPS to
that used during spaceﬂight. The environmental parameters (air temperature, relative humidity, and
C02 concentration) of the ISS cabin observed during the ﬂight were reproduced in the Orbital
Environmental Simulator (OES) Chamber at the Kennedy Space Center. The average Chamber
environmental values during the three PESTO plantings are shown below (T able 1). All the on— orbit
Operations performed during spaceﬂight were mimicked during the ground control experiment.

bRoot temperature was not controlled

In addition to the ground control experiment, a second set of Chamber control plants was grown in
ﬂight—like PGCs used in the PESTO experiment at 1 g. T hese PGCs were grown under identical
environmental conditions in a conventional walk—in plant growth Chamber (Environmental Growth
Chambers, Model EGC M—48, Chagrin Falls, OH). The differences between the ﬂight and ground
control plants were exposure to microgravity and the spaceﬂight operations (launch, ISS transfer, and

"
"5","landing). The difference between the ground and Chamber control plants was that humidity and
temperature control was provided by the plant growth chamber. Root zone moisture control was
provided by a stand—pipe system, which provided a constant matric potential (—O.3 kPa) (Monje et al.
200]). Environmentally, the ground control plants had an average root temperature of 27°C and the
chamber control plants had a root temperature of 24°C, while all other environmental parameters were
identical.
Plant stand evapotranspiration
The amount of water used by each ﬂight and ground control PGC was monitored continuously during
each experiment cycle for the entire mission. Evapotranspiration moistens the air in the PGC and the
Humidity Control System (HCS) removes any excess moisture Via a porous plate dehumidifier.
Moisture condensed from the PGC atmosphere by the HCS is metered as it is pumped into a water
reservoir and the rate of condensate removal is proportional to ET. In the nutrient delivery system
(NDS), a pressure sensor in the root module maintains a constant matric potential in the root zone by
supplying metered amounts of water from the water reservoir by a pump. This ‘on demand1 addition of
water is also proportional to ET 0f the stand (Fig. l). The daily water additions for each chamber were
summed and used to determine the daily rates of water ET.

Fig. 1 Air and water fluxes of the humidity control (HCS) and nutrient delivery (NDS) subsystems of the
Biomass Production System. Water supplied to the root module evaporated from the substrate and was
transpired by leaves. Water vapor condensed in the HCS was supplied to the water reservoir
Plant stand transpiration could be estimated from ET by subtracting the rate of root module
evaporation. Although evaporation was not measured in this study, it was assumed to equal the rate of
ET in PGC 4 (~14 ml/day 0r ~O.35 mmol m—2 s_l). The Brassica plants in PGC4 grew very slowly,
relative to wheat, so most of the ET in that Chamber was due to evaporation from the root module.
Plant stand photosynthesis
The rate of net canopy carbon assimilation in the Chamber (Pnet) was obtained using the semi—Closed
gas exchange system of the BPS. Pm:t was estimated daily from the rate of C02 additions used to
maintain a constant C02 setpoint in the BPS Chambers during the light period. Photosynthesis

"
"6","measurements were possible only after the plants in the Chambers were large enough to bring down the
Chamber C02 concentration below the 1500 In moi m01‘1 setpoint. The rate of C02 additions was
corrected for Chamber leak rate and for chamber :.-er0ss—ta1k~.: associated with multiplexing of sample
gas lines to a common detector (Morrow et a1. 2001; Stutte et a1. 2000).
Light distribution
Light distribution measurements were made with Chamber control plants during ground studies to
Characterize how light intensity diminishes with height within each BPS chamber. A gallium arsenide
(GaAs) photodiode (G1116; Hamamatsu), which was calibrated against a quantum sensor (LI— 190,
LiCor, Lincoln, NE) under cool white ﬂuorescent lamps, was used to measure light intensity at various
heights above the root module in an empty Chamber (Fig 2a). Similar measurements were made with
15, 18 and 22—day—old wheat plants in the Chamber control PGCs in order to Characterize how leaves
attenuate incident radiation as leaf area increases (Fig. 2b).

Fig. 2 Light distribution measured in Chamber control plants at various distances from the top of the Chamber. a
In an empty Chamber, light intensity decreased linearly and light distribution was more variable with depth. b Light
intensity decreased exponentially with depth when plants were present in the Chamber. Older plant stands (18
and 22 DAP) attenuated the light level more rapidly than younger ones (15 DAP) because of a higher leaf area
index
Absorbed PPF and leaf area
Leaf area and absorbed PPF from the 3rd planting of ﬂight and ground control plants were measured at
23 days after planting (DAP). The ﬂight plants were harvested within 2 h after landing. Similarly, leaf
area and absorbed PPF from Chamber control plants were measured at 15, 18, and 21 DAP. Absorbed
PPF was measured prior to harvest according to the method described in Monje and Bugbee (1998).
The amount of PPF absorbed by a plant stand is determined from four components: incident PPF,
reﬂected incident PPF, transmitted PPF, and reﬂected transmitted PPF. Whole—plant leaf area was
measured destructively using a portable leaf area meter (Model LI—3000A, LiCor, Lincoln, NE). Leaf
area index (LAI, meter square leaf area per meter square of ground area) was estimated using
measurements of leaf area of single plants. LAI was calculated by multiplying the single plant leaf area
(em2 /p1ant) by 32 plants per PGC and dividing by the ground area of the Chamber (264 emz).
Leaf area distribution

"
"7","Apogee wheat can rapidly fill the PGCs with leaves during vegetative growth since its height at 21
DAP (22—24 cm) exceeds the height of the BPS Chambers (13 cm). Leaf area distribution was
estimated using Chamber control plants to ensure that the leaf area in the Chamber did not cause
excessive self— shading that might reduce gas eXChange rates.

LAI and absorbed PPF were used to determine the canopy extinction coefficient, k, which combines
many plant and canopy Characteristics into a single property, including leaf size, shape, thickness,
degree of vertical leaf area distribution, and the proportions of direct and diffuse radiation (Monteith
and Unsworth 1990). k was calculated from the following relation: Absorbed PPF = [1—eXp(—k >< LAD]
(Campbell and Norman 1998). Once k was known, leaf area distribution in the Chambers was derived
from light attenuation measurements using the Monsi—Saeki Equation: I = 10 x eXp(—kXLAI), where 10
is the incident light intensity, I is the intensity at the bottom of the canopy (I at 13 cm below the light
bank). This approach calculates the LAI of successive horizontal layers of the plant canopy from light
intensity measurements (10 and I ) made at different heights below the top of the Chamber. The leaf area
distribution determined using this method is only an approximation to the actual leaf distribution in the
PGCs because absorbed PPF, which is used to derive k, was determined by removing the canopy from
the PGC.

Plant stand ET responses to VPD

Plant response to vapor pressure difference (VPD) was measured during the 2nd planting of PESTO
using l2—day—old wheat ﬂight and ground control plants. ET was varied by Changing the vapor pressure
gradient (O.35—1.3 kPa) 0f the Chamber through pre—programmed Changes in air temperature (20°C,
24°C, 28°C) and relative humidity (65%, 75%, 85%). ET was measured every 2 min, which is
equivalent to 60 data points/hr. Each temperature and humidity setpoint combination was run for 3 h to
ensure that steady state conditions were reached. A 2 h period of 24°C and 75% RH was run between
each of these setpoint combinations. Plant stand water use was determined at each VPD level. ET rates
were derived from the rate of water removed from the Chamber into the HCS system and from the
average rate of water addition to the root module through the NDS system during each three—hour
period.

Water use efficiency

Plant stand water use efficiency (WUE; lu mol C02 mmol H20_1 or g C02 (kg H20)_1) was calculated
daily from the ratio of Pnet t0 ET for ﬂight and ground control plants.

Statistical analysis

The statistical model was established so that the three plantings (launched, stowed, and landed) were
the main plots and the days after planting (6—20 DAP)were the split plots. Daily gas eXChange rates
(ET, Pnet, and WUE) from siX Chambers were used for the analysis. The gas eXChange rates were
averaged within plantings across ChambersUsing plantings as the main plots, rather than Chambers, is
justified by assuming that the Chambers are all identical and the random variation in the experimental
units is in the plantings and not in the Chambers (D. Poritz, personal communication).

The PESTO experiment had siX plantings (main plots), three for ﬂight and three for ground. Status
(ﬂight or ground) is the treatment factor applied to the main plots.T his means that there is 1 degree of
freedom (df) for status, 4 (if !s for error from main plots, and thus 5 (if !s for the corrected total. The

"
"8","average gas exchange rate of three plantings was used at each DAP for each treatment. The split plots
are the 15 DAPs from day 6 to day 20, and time in days is the treatment factor applied to the split
p10ts.The DAPs are not, strictly speaking, split plots because time cannot be assigned in random order,
but they are repeated measurements within the main plots. The covariance among gas exchange rates
over DAPs was estimated to be zer0.The statistical power of this analysis was computed, which is the
probability of rejecting the null hypothesis when an alternative hypothesis is true. This power
computation was based on the t—distribution with 4 df.

Resu Its

Leaf area

Leaf area, absorbed PPF (labs), and LAI in the chamber control plants increased as the plants grew
from 15 DAP to 21 DAP (Table 2). The extinction coefficient decreased as the canopy intercepted
more radiation and plant stand height remained constant after 18 DAP. The ﬂight and ground control
plants grown in the BPS were different than the Chamber control plants: lower leaf area, lower
absorbed PPF, lower LAI and ~30 em taller (data obtained from the 3rd planting upon landing). The
leaf area reduction was such that the 23—day—01d ﬂight and ground control plants had nearly the same
leaf area of the 18—day—01d Chamber control plants (Table 2). These differences indicate that the
growing environment within the BPS was markedly different than the environment in a conventional
plant growth Chamber set at the same environmental conditions.

Leaf area distribution

In an empty chamber, light intensity decreased linearly with depth (Fig. 2a). The light intensity at the
top of the root modules (~13 cm below the top of the Chamber) was 75% 0f the intensity at the top. In
contrast, light intensity within chamber control plant stands declines exponentially with depth, and the
rate of decline depends on the age of the plant (Fig. 2b). Light intensity in the PGCs becomes 10w
(<100 lu mol n1‘2 s_l) after only 4 cm of depth at 15 DAP, and this decreases further (<50 In

mol n1‘2 s_l) at 22 DAP as self— shading becomes accentuated. Younger plants have less leaf area to

"
"9","intercept incident light (T able 2), thereby allowing light to penetrate deeper into the Chamber at 15
DAP than at 18 and 22 DAP.
The light attenuation data in Fig. 2b and the extinction coefficient, k (T able 2) were used to estimate
leaf area distribution within the PGCs (Fig. 3). In the Chamber control plants (solid lines), the leaf area
index found at the top of the Chamber at 15 DAP was much less than at 18 DAP. For comparison, the
leaf area distribution from the ﬂight (dashed line) and ground control (thin line) plants was calculated
using the measured k values and the light profile from an 18—day—old Chamber control plant stand,
because they had similar leaf areas (T able 2). Although leaf area distribution was not measured on 188,
this comparison shows that even though the ﬂight plants had significantly less leaf area than the ground
control plants, their leaf area distribution was similar, so that a large difference in absorbed PPF would
not be expected.

Fig. 3 The leaf area at various heights was estimated from measured canopy extinction coefficients (Table 2)
and light profile data (Fig. 2) using Eq. 1. The highest leaf areas were found in the uppermost 2—3 cm of the
chamber by 18 DAP in Chamber control plants, which suggests that the top layers of leaves intercept most of the
incident light. The leaf area distribution of 23-day-old flight plants (thin line) was similar to that of ground control
(dashed line) plants. A large difference in absorbed PPF would not be expected between the flight and ground
control plants because they had a similar leaf area distribution
Evapotranspiration and photosynthesis
The cumulative amount of water used by ﬂight and ground plant stands was not significantly different
in microgravity (Fig. 4a). Using the customary values of statistical size (5%) and statistical power
(80%), the experimental setup used can detect a difference in ET greater than :0.29 mmol n1‘2 s_l.
T here was a significant decrease in ET for ﬂight compared to ground, since the mean ET in ﬂight was
0.37 mmol n1‘2 s‘1 smaller than the ground control (standard error (SE) of 0.07). The effect of DAPs
on ET was also significant because plants grew as they aged, but the interaction of status with DAPs
was not significant. A difference of —0.37 mmol m‘2 s‘1 is too small to be considered physiologically
significant, however, it may reﬂect the reduced leaf area in the ﬂight plants compared to the ground
control plants (T able 2).

Fig. 4 a Evapotranspiration (ET), measured as the cumulative amount of water supplied to the root module,
increased as the plants grew during the experiment. The flight and ground control plants had similar dry masses
at harvest and similar ET, indicating they grew at similar growth rates. b ET increased during the life cycle
reaching a plateau of 4.5 mmol m‘2 s‘1 after 17 DAP. There was no significant physiological difference in plant
stand ET between flight and ground control plants. Each data point is the average daily water use or ET from the
three plantings (launched, stowed, and landed)
Plant stand photosynthesis measurements began as soon as the plants in, the Chambers were large
enough to reduce the Chamber C02 concentration below the 1,500 In mol m01‘1 setpoint (~4—5 DAP).
Photosynthesis increased daily as the plants grew and accumulated leaf area (Fig. 5a). Pnet increased
until ~16 DAP when the plant canopy became Closed e.g., when all incident light was absorbed.
Figs. 2b and 3 suggest that Pmt is mostly due to the uppermost leaf layers after 15 DAP. The lack of
gravity had no effect on plant stand Pnet during the 21 days that it was measured. The power
computation determined that the experimental setup could detect a difference in Pmt greater than 11.35
In mol m—2 s‘l. The difference in Pmt for ﬂight minus ground was —O.20 lu mol m—2 s‘1 with a SE of
0.37. The effect of DAPs 0n Pnet was significant, but the interaction of status with DAPs was not. An
examination of the least squares means for DAPs shows Clear leveling off of Pmt with time starting
with day 16 (data not shown).

Water use efficiency
Water use efficiency increased from 1.3 Iumol mmol‘1 (3.5 gC02 (kgH20)_1) at 5 DAP to 2.7 In
m01mm01‘1 (6.5 gCO2 (kgH20)_1) by 15 DAP (Fig. 5b). After 15 DAP, WUE leveled off as the
Chamber became filled with leaves (Fig. 3). The ﬂight plants (thin line) had a slightly higher WUE than
the ground control plants (thick line; Fig. 5b), however, this difference was not statistically significant.
The ground control plants had a lower WUE because they had a slightly higher ET than the ﬂight
plants (Fig. 4b). The power computation determined that the experimental setup used can detect a
difference inWUE greater than 10.34 .11 mol mmol‘l. The difference in WUE for ﬂight minus ground
was 0.13 Iumol mmol‘1 with an SE of 0.12.

The response of ET t0 Chamber VPD was examined by measuring the amount of water removed by the
HCS system at each VPD. Chamber VPD increased when Chamber temperature was increased or
humidity was lowered. The relation between ET measured by HCS condensate removal and Chamber
VPD was linear until it saturated after 0.8 kPa (Fig. 6). The response of ET t0 VPD measured by water
added to the NDS system did not saturate after 0.8 kPa (data not shown) and remained linear up to
1.35 kPa. T here was no significant effect of microgravity 0n the response of ET t0 VPD, as evidenced
by similar slopes between ET and VPD in ﬂight (s10pe=2.88, r2=0.989) and ground control plants

The effects of weightlessness on growth and development of plants are of primary importance for
developing the appropriate technologies and cultural conditions ensuring stress—free plant growth in
microgravity (Monje et a1. 2003), for understanding the basic mechanisms responsible for gravitropic
responses (Chen et a1. 1999; Kern et a1. 2001 ; LaurinaViCius et a1. 2001), and for evaluating the use of
plants in regenerative life support systems (Miller and Ward 1966; Olson et a1. 1988; Wheeler et a1.
2001). An objective of the ISS PESTO experiment was to determine the effect of microgravity on plant
stand gas exchange. Plant transpiration and photosynthesis are controlled by physiological (e.g.
stomatal conductance), morphological (e.g. leaf area distribution) and environmental (e.g. PPF, VPD,
[C02]) factors (Monteith and Unsworth 1990). In the PESTO experiment, the experimental design
allowed the manipulation of environmental controls (VPD), as well as the capacity to detect Changes in
plant morphology because live plants grown in space were harvested on Earth. The hypothesis that gas
exchange in space is governed by the gradients between leaves and the air surrounding them was
studied by comparing replicated measurements of plant evapotranspiration and photosynthetic rates in
ﬂight and ground control plant stands.

PESTO utilized the BPS, a unique and versatile plant growth system that provided a tightly controlled,
replicated environment for rapid plant growth in microgravity. The BPS was deployed on 188 and
several plant stands were grown for 21—day cycles at constant light level, air temperature, relative
humidity, [C02], ethylene concentration, and root zone matric potential. The BPS accommodated high
rates of ET, while still maintaining adequate air temperature and humidity control. It also permitted the
nondestructive measurement of canopy gas exchange rates (ET and Pnet) at moderate light levels
(~3OO lu mol m‘2 s_l) and elevated C02 (1500 It; mol m01‘1). The BPS PGCs provided a growing
volume of ~3400 cm3 (264 cm2 of ground area by 13 cm of height), which is small for growing wheat
for a full life cycle. USU Apogee, a semi—dwarf wheat cultivar reaching a height of 30—40 cm at
maturity, was grown for only 21 DAP, therefore the leaves grow towards the light until 13—14 DAP
when they reach the top of the Chamber (Stutte et a1. 2003). After 18 DAP, the canopy becomes Closed
as the leaves start bending, leaf area increases along the top of the Chamber, and self— shading becomes
more important (Fig. 3). In each PGC, ET was measured by the amount of water condensed by the
HCS system and Pnet was measured by the amount of C02 added to maintain a constant Chamber
[C02] setpoint. The gas exchange rates were measured continuously during 21—day cycles and were
corrected for Chamber leak rates and Chamber—to—Chamber cross—talk (Stutte et a1. 2000). A comparison
between Chamber control and ground control plants revealed that there are large morphological
differences (taller plants with less leaf area) between BPS—grewn plants and plants growing in
conventional controlled environments. Potential environmental factors responsible for these
morphological differences may be the atmospheric Closure in the BPS compared to a conventional
growth chamber or increased root zone temperature (~3°C higher) in the BPS.

ET ranged from 1.5 mmol m‘2 s‘1 at 10 DAP to ~45 mmol m‘2 s‘1 (or 6.8 L m‘2 d_l) at 21 DAP
(Fig. 4b). The rates of ET reported here are lower than ET of 20—21 DAP wheat (4—5.8 mmol m‘2 s_l)
measured at 2.3 times the light level (650 In mol m‘2 s_l) and comparable [C02] (Wheeler 1992;
Cornett et a1. 1994). However, rates of ET in the BPS are higher than ET rates measured in the SVET
greenhouse aboard Space Station Mir (2—2.5 mmol m‘2 S4) at the same light level (Monje et a1. 2000).

"
"13","Morphological differences in leaf area may have been responsible for these comparatively higher
transpiration rates measured in BPS. The plants in SVET were exposed to cabin air containing 0.6—1 lu
mol 11101‘1 of ethylene (Levinskikh et al. 2000), which has been reported to cause reduced leaf area and
stunted growth in wheat (Klassen and Bugbee 2002).

Growth in microgravity did not Change the amount of water transpired and evaporated from the root
modules (Fig. 4a). This direct comparison between ﬂight and ground control plants was only possible
since there were no differences in germination rates between the ﬂight and ground root modules (Stutte
et al. 2003), and each root module had a similar number of plants. Similarly, long—term exposure to
microgravity did not result in significant differences in gas eXChange rates: ET (Fig. 4b) or Pnet

(Fig. 5a). Altogether these results indicate that microgravity does not alter plant stand growth rates. A
more important finding from these gas eXChange measurements was that there were no significant
differences among the three PESTO plantings (launched, stowed, and landed), which means that plants
grown at 1 g at moderate light levels (300 In mol n1‘2 s_l) and exposed to spaceﬂight behave the same
as gravity nai've plants.

The ﬂight plants had significantly lower leaf area (~22%; T able 2) than the ground control plants,
however, this difference did not translate into a significant reduction in absorbed PPF (T able 2). The
analysis in Fig. 3 indicates that the reduced leaf area probably did not alter leaf area distribution enough
to cause corresponding reductions in absorbed PPF. T herefore, the observed morphological Changes did
not result in significant Changes in gas eXChange rates, except for a small, albeit statistically significant
reduction in ET in ﬂight compared with ground control plants (Fig. 4b). A corresponding decrease in
Pnet would not be expected unless a large Change in absorbed PPF was observed because it is
determined by the amount of illuminated leaf area at the top of the Chamber, and the contribution of the
underlying shaded leaf area to canopy photosynthetic rates is small.

The hypothesis that gas eXChange in space is governed by the gradients between leaves and the air
surrounding them was further tested by studying the response of ET to Changes in Chamber VPD in
microgravity. No direct effect of microgravity on gas exchange is expected as long as wind speed is
high enough to prevent diffusion—limited transport because microgravity may reduce the leaf boundary
layer conductanees at low wind speeds due to the absence of buoyancy driven convection (Kitaya et al.
2003). Porterfield (2002) concluded that significant reductions in photosynthesis in and other
physiological processes may occur when gravity—dependent transport phenomena no longer operate. ET
responses to VPD were measured using 12—day—old plants in a well—ventilated PGC. In wheat growing
at constant VPD and elevated [C02], a linear relation between canopy stomatal conductance and
transpiration was observed (Monje and Bugbee 1996), and canopy stomatal conductance was less
responsive to increased VPD at elevated [C02] (Monje 1998; Bunee 1998; Bunee 2000). Exposure to
dry air was expected to increase ET in proportion to the increased VPD between the leaves and air,
unless the drier air reduced stomatal conductance. ET increased linearly with increasing Chamber VPD
in both ﬂight and ground control plants up to a VPD of 0.8 kPa (Fig. 6), which suggests that stomatal
conductance became constant at high VPD. Mierogravity did not affect the response of ET to VPD
since the slope of the response in the ﬂight plants was the same as in the ground control plants (similar
slopes; Fig. 6).

Canopy water use efficiency is a parameter used in field situations to measure a plant stand ls ability to
cope with water stress, and it is also an indicator of COz/HQO vapor eXChange, which is ultimately
regulated by stomatal conductance (Farquhar and Richards 1984). Canopy WUE was unaffected by
microgravity. In the BPS Chambers, canopy WUE of wheat was ~2.7 Iu mol mmol‘1 (6.6 gCO2

"
"14","(kgH20)_1), which is greater than typical values of WUE for C3 plants in the field (0.4—1.2 lu

moi mmol‘1 or 1—3 gC02 (kgH20)_1; Nobel 1999). WUE in a controlled environment plant Chamber is
expected to be higher than in the field because stomata are less open at lower light levels, and growth
at elevated C02 Closes stomata further.

In conclusion, microgravity did not affect gas exchange rates (ET and Pnet) of wheat plant stands
growing at moderate light levels (~300 lu mol n1‘2 S4) and saturating C02 concentrations. T hese
findings suggest that plant stand water purification and food production rates will not Change in space
because the underlying biological processes operate at the same rates as in 1 g at moderate light levels.
This finding implies that future plant—based regenerative life support systems operating at similar light
levels can be sized using 1 g data. However, it remains to be verified whether the present results are
reproducible in plants grown under stronger light levels. In previous studies, a significant (~17%)
reduction in whole—Chain electron transport was observed in Chloroplast extracts from plants raised in
microgravity at high light levels (T ripathy et a1. 1996). In this study, decreased leaf area was not large
enough to cause significant differences in plant stand gas exchange rates or growth rates, but a slight
reduction in ET and a small increase in WUE were discerned in the plant stands growing in
microgravity. Decreased leaf area may explain the lower ET, but the reason for the reduction in leaf
area cannot be ascribed to differences in environmental parameters between the ﬂight and ground
control plants. Future work will be needed to assess the underlying cause of the decreased leaf area
Observed in mierogravity—grown plants.
