there were some trends toward reduced proliferation of stimulated T—lymphocytes. There
was an apparent post ﬂight decrease in secreted IFN—g for the majority of crewmembers
and in most instances there was elevation in secreted IL—10. It revealed depression of IFN—g/
IL—10 ratio after ﬂight. Correlation analysis according to Spearman’s rank correlation test
established signiﬁcant positive correlations (p< 0.05) between cytokine production and
T—cell activation (CD25+, CD38+) and negative correlation (p <0.05) between cytokine
production and number of bulk memory CD4+T—cells (CD45RO+). Thus, these results
suggest that T—cell dysfunction can be conditioned by cytokine dysbalance and could lead
to development of disease after long—duration space ﬂights.
