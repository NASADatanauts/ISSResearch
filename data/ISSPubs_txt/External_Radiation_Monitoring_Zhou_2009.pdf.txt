Abstract
Radiation in low Earth orbit (LEO) is mainly composed of galactic cosmic rays (GCR), solar energetic particles and particles in SAA
(South Atlantic Anomaly). The biological impact of space radiation to astronauts depends strongly on the particles’ linear energy trans—
fer (LET) and is dominated by high LET radiation. It is important to measure the LET spectrum for the space radiation ﬁeld and to
investigate the inﬂuence of radiation on astronauts. At present, the preferred active dosimeters sensitive to all LET are the tissue equiv—
alent proportional counter (TEPC) and the silicon detectors in various conﬁgurations; the preferred passive dosimeters are CR—39 plastic
nuclear track detectors (PNTDs) sensitive to high LET and thermoluminescence dosimeters (TLDs) as well as optically stimulated lumi—
nescence dosimeters (OSLDs) sensitive to low LET. The TEPC, CR—39 PNTDs, TLDs and OSLDs were used to investigate the radiation
ﬁeld for the ISS mission Expedition 13 (188—128) in LEO. LET spectra and radiation quantities (ﬂuence, absorbed dose, dose equivalent
and quality factor) were measured for the space mission with different dosimeters. This paper introduces the role of high LET radiation
in radiobiology, the operational principles for the different dosimeters, the LET spectrum method using CR—39 detectors, the method to
combine the results measured with TLDs/OSLDs and CR—39 PNTDs, and presents the LET spectra and the radiation quantities mea—
sured and combined.
