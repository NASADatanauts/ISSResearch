-. 5:3 CPI (pictured in Figure 1) follows on from the discoveries of UVCS/SOHO to answer the basic ques-

tion: What physical processes heat and accelerate both the major (proton, electron, helium) and minor

(heavy ion) plasma components of the fast and Slow solar wind? In the remainder of this section, we

outline the historical context of CPI and how this experiment will fundamentally transform our observational

understanding of solar wind acceleration. Section 2 gives additional information about the scientiﬁc goals of

CPI. Section 3 describes the CPI science payload, and Section 4 discusses the accommodation of CPI on the

188. Section 5 gives an overview of the CPI mission, and Section 6 describes the CPI team, management,

and costs.

Ultraviolet spectroscopy of the extended solar corona (deﬁned here as 2 1.4 solar radii, R9, from Sun
center) has become a powerful tool for obtaining detailed empirical descriptions of the regions where
solar wind streams and coronal mass ejections (CMEs) undergo most of their acceleration. Ultraviolet
spectroscopy allows us to determine the velocity distributions and outﬂow velocities of protons and minor

ions near the Sun, it provides absolute chemical abundances and charge state distributions, and it is capable
of determining the velocity distributions and densities of electrons (e.g., Withbroe et a1. 1982; Kohl et a1.
2006). These observations provide the constraints needed to test and guide theoretical models of extended
coronal heating, solar wind acceleration, and CME production.

Oeeulted ultraviolet telescope-speetrometers were ﬁrst developed and ﬂown on sounding rockets (1979,
1980, 1982) and on the Shuttle-deployed Spartan 20] payload (1993, 1994, 1995, 1998); see, e.g., Kohl
et a1. (1978, 1994, 2006). Following on the successes of these pilot observations, the Ultraviolet Corona-
graph Spectrometer (UVCS) instrument was ﬂown on the ESA/NASA Solar and Heliospheric Observatory
(SOHO) spacecraft (Kohl et a1. 1995). UVCS/SOHO began observing in 1996 and is scheduled to continue
operations until September 2012.

In the fast solar wind, UVCS discovered remarkably strong preferential ion heating for 0+5 and Mg+9
and pronounced kinetic anisotropies (with T 1 > T”) in polar coronal holes (Kohl et a1. 1997, 1998, 2006;
Cranmer et a1. 1999, 2008). These results rekindled theoretical efforts to understand the heating of the
extended corona by ion cyclotron resonance (Hollweg & Isenberg 2002), though we still do not understand
how these waves are produced. In the slow solar wind, much of which originates in streamers, efforts have
centered on attempts to understand the relative roles of reconnection and magnetic ﬂux tube geometry, but
there is evidence for wave processes similar to those seen in the fast wind (Frazin et a1. 2003).

"
"3","Despite the advances outlined above, though, the diagnostic capabilities of UVCS were limited to what
was foreseen before SOHO (when only H I Lya had been observed). UVCS allowed us to identify what
additional measurements need to be made to answer the fundamental questions about how solar wind streams
are produced, and we have designed the next-generation capabilities of the CPI experiment speciﬁcally
to make those measurements. As will be described below in more detail, CPI provides unprecedented
sensitivity, a wavelength range extending from 25.7 to 126 nm, improved time resolution, and the capability
to measure UV line proﬁles never before seen in coronal holes in the extended corona. CPI would be the ﬁrst
mission to be able to fully Characterize the plasma properties in the region where the solar wind’s primary
energy and momentum addition occurs.

The CPI ooronagraph spectrometer design is a departure from earlier next-generation concepts that
achieved the required increase in sensitivity with a remote external oooulter mounted on a deployable boom,
and improved detector performance with an Intensiﬁed Active Pixel Sensor (IAPS) detection system with
a high maximum count per pixel capability. CPI achieves its high sensitivity with an internally oooulted
ooronagraph design that provides up to a factor of 200 increase in count rates over UVCS/SOHO. Since
solar disk to solar coronal intensity ratios in the ultraviolet are smaller than for Visible light, it was possible
to design the internally oooulted CPI to have sufﬁcient stray light suppression to observe spectral lines of
interest in coronal holes at the crucial heights of > 1.8 R9, where oollisionless wave-partiole interactions
are believed to dominate. CPI uses an ICCD detector similar to those provided for Swift and XMM/Newton
by the Mullard Space Science Laboratory. This detector meets all of the CPI observation requirements, and
eliminates any question about its technical readiness level. The CPI resource requirements are well within
the capabilities of the 188, which can provide 16 orbits per day and 310 days per year of solar observations.
By taking advantage of the existing capabilities of ISS, CPI achieves its soienoe goals at far less cost than
would be needed for an independent mission.

The CPI project will not only make a tremendous advance in solar wind science, it will provide a bridge
to the next solar maximum when there is considerable interest in a mission to focus on the most energetic
ﬂares, CMEs, and energetic particle acceleration events (e.g., the SEE 2020 mission concept; Lin et al.
2010). The new CPI team—inoluding Dan Reisenfeld as Project Scientist and Paul Janzen as Instrument
Scientist, as well as Tim Norton as Project Manager and the new collaboration with the industrial partner
L-3 Com Integrated Optical Systems—would continue to be in place for this opportunity.

CPI ﬁts well into the constraints of an Explorer Small Complete Mission with large teohnioal reserves,
seven months of oosted schedule reserves beyond a robust 48 month phase B/C/D baseline development
schedule, 25% cost reserves plus a 5% margin, and a $4M desoope plan with vary little impact on the
primary science.

2. Scientiﬁc Goals and Objectives
2.]. Solar Wind Acceleration

CPI will address the fundamental question of the identiﬁcation of the energy and momentum deposition
processes that accelerate the solar wind. Figure 2 illustrates the range of solar wind issues to be explored
by CPI. A large body of spaoe-based and ground-based observations suggests that AlfVen waves eXist in
the lower solar atmosphere and carry enough power to accelerate the wind and heat the quiet corona (e.g.,
Cranmer & van Ballegooijen 2005; De Pontieu et al. 2007; Moore et al. 2011). However, the mechanisms
that convert these waves into heat and kinetic energy are still not understood. The lack of tight constraints on
the plasma properties near the Sun is the maj or roadblock to a comprehensive understanding of the relevant
processes. Thus, CPI has been designed to make maj or breakthroughs by answering speciﬁc questions such
as the following.

in coronal holes (red: protons, green: 0+5) are described in more detail by Cranmer (2009). Black open circles denote
slow Wind outﬂow speeds from Sheeley et a1. (1997) and blue symbols denote electron temperatures from Wilhelm

(2006) and Landi (2008).

How and where do plasma ﬂuctuations drive the preferential ion heating and acceleration? UVCS
discovered extreme ion properties in coronal holes that pointed to the damping of high-frequenoy (10—
104 Hz) ion cyclotron waves, but these measurements were limited to only two minor ions (Kohl et a1.
1998, 1999). Thus, it has been difﬁcult to unambiguously conﬁrm the ion cyclotron idea or distinguish it
Clearly from other processes such as stochastic AlfVén wave damping (e.g., Voitenko & Goossens 2004;
Chandran 2010), shook acceleration (Lee & Wu 2000), or shear—driven instabilities (Markovskii et a1. 2006).
By measuring the properties of ions With a Wide range of Charge and mass over a large range of heights,
CPI Will tightly constrain the properties of the spectrum of ﬂuctuations thanks to its high sensitivity and
large spectral coverage. By comparing CPI minor ion measurements to the predictions of kinetic and MHD
models, we can tightly constrain the spectral slope, the local damping, and the precise modes (AlfVén,
fast, slow) of the waves. As the number of ions observed in each region increases, our conﬁdence in the
uniqueness of a successful theoretical model (based on a given process) increases as well.

What processes contribute to heating the primary (proton, electron, helium) plasma in the extended
corona and accelerating the solar wind? CPI Will determine the degree of bulk-plasrna heating and ae-
oeleration from the most likely physical processes. The properties of the resonant wave spectrum (from
the previous question) are key inputs to this question as well, but additional CPI observations are needed
to constrain the full range of processes. The primary UV measurements for this question are the proton,
electron, and helium plasma properties; e.g., H I Lya resonance scattering line proﬁles (H0 is Closely
coupled to protons by Charge transfer; Allen et a1. 2000), H I Lya Thomson scattering line proﬁles (a
probe of the electron velocity distribution), and He II 30.4 nm line proﬁles. The methodology for this
question involves comparing heating and acceleration rates (derived from measured temperatures, densities,
and outﬂow speeds) to rates predicted by theoretical models of the following:

1. High-frequency (or other ion-resonant kinetic) waves: The information about the resonant wave
spectrum obtained from minor ions can be extrapolated to predict proton and helium energization rates
that are associated With the speciﬁc “ﬂavor” of wave-partiole interaction that is evaluated to be consistent
With the ion measurements discussed above.

4

"
"5","2. Low-frequency waves: CPI can constrain the amplitudes of low-frequency waves that may not be
efﬁcient at heating minor ions. These waves can accelerate the plasma by wave pressure and possibly
heat electrons Via Landau damping. Preliminary observations of long-period (10—20 minute) compressive
ﬂuctuations in coronal holes have been made (e.g., DeForest & Gurman 1998; Krishna Prasad et al. 201 1),
but CPI can conﬁrm and better characterize the full plasma response to these ﬂuctuations. Also, models
that predict signiﬁcant ponderomotive acceleration from low-frequenoy waves (Ofman & DaVila 2001)
can be tested by constraining the available power.

3. Suprathermal particles: Ubiquitous in space plasmas, particles in the tails of proton and electron
velocity distributions have been suggested as key contributors to coronal heating (Scudder 1992; Viﬁas
et al. 2000) and in determining in situ charge states (Esser & Edgar 2000). The presence of strong tails
in the very low corona is doubtful because of the high collision rate (Feldman et al. 2007), but CPI can
detect these tails in proton and electron distributions (Via departures from Gaussian shapes in the H I Lya
proﬁles) well into the oollisionless domain at large heights.

CPI Will also answer detailed questions about mapping the origins of in situ solar Wind streams down to the

coronal magnetic ﬁeld, and about the role of episodic jets and reconnection in the solar Wind’s mass and

energy budget. These questions are discussed further in Section 2.3 below, along With the contributions of
other NASA heliophysics missions. In addition, the improved understanding of coronal physics that CPI

will facilitate is important not only for explaining the origins of space weather, but also for establishing a

baseline of knowledge directly relevant to other stars and astrophysical systems ranging from the interstellar

medium to black hole accretion disks.
2.2. Coronal Mass Ejections (CMES)

CMEs are a secondary objective for CPI because solar minimum conditions will prevail during the mis-
sion’s primary phase. Nevertheless, there Will be one CME every 2—3 days based on LASCO observations
(Yashiro et al. 2004), and we expect to observe 30 to 50 CMEs during the primary mission and considerably
more during the extended mission thanks to increasing solar activity. UVCS demonstrated the power of
spectroscopy to unravel the physics of CMEs (see Kohl et al. 2006), but new observational capabilities
are needed to answer the most fundamental questions. CPI Will provide a Wide range of unambiguous
diagnostics for the physical conditions of CMEs. This is enabled by a multi-slit capability and the sensitivity
and spectral range that permit observation of He II 30.4 nm and several density-diagnostio line ratios
(e.g., Ne VII 89.5/88.7 nm and 0 VI 554/555 nm) to constrain time-dependent ionization models of the
expanding plasma. CPI Will address the following questions.

What physical processes drive the evolution and heating of CMES in the corona? UVCS data have been
used to reconstruct the 3D structures and thermal histories of a small number of CMEs, and there is evidence
that the plasma in CMEs is strongly heated as it accelerates (e.g., Lee et al. 2009; Landi et al. 2010). The
nature of the heating is not known, but a number of energization mechanisms have been proposed (Kumar
& Rust 1996; Lin et al. 2004; Reeves et al. 2010; Murphy et al. 2011). CPI Will help distinguish between
the predictions of these different models by measuring plasma parameters not only in the brightest parts of
CMEs (e.g., the bright front and the twisted remnants of the prominence or ﬂux rope) but also in the dimmer
“void” region behind the front and the shock ahead of the front.

What is the role ofmagnetie reconnection in the eruption and relaxation of the coronal magnetic ﬁeld in
CMES? In the classic CME picture (Sturrock & Coppi 1966), an erupting ﬂux rope leaves behind oppositely
directed open ﬁelds that are separated by a current sheet. Reconnection in this sheet produces an arcade of
post-CME loops seen as large X-ray ﬂares, at the same time allowing the twisted ﬂux rope to escape as the
CME plasmoid (Lin & Forbes 2000). In a few events, UVCS detected spatially narrow emission features
in [Fe XVIII] 97.4 nm (formed at Te % 6 MK) that match the expected properties of thin current sheets

5

"
"6","(Raymond 2008). CPI Will observe many more lines from the extremely hot plasma at these reconnection
sites, up to [Fe XXII] 82.2 nm, With improved sensitivity. Line ratios Will be used to infer the electron
temperature, density, and ﬂow speeds (Ko et al. 2010). Line Widths measured by CPI can be used to put
limits on the velocity amplitude of turbulent motions in current sheets (see Kowal et al. 2009).

2.3. Relationships to Other NASA Missions

A unique strength of CPI is how it both strongly complements and is complemented by other NASA solar
missions planned for the same time period. The following questions represent examples of the Wider science
objectives achievable by integrating CPI measurements With those from other missions.

How do nanoﬂares and magnetic reconnection affect the solar wind? UV and X-ray imaging instruments
on SDO, Hinade, STEREO, IRIS, and Solar Orbiter Will put tight new constraints on the mechanisms respon-
sible for the intermittent energy release from reconnection events below ~1.2 R9. CPI measurements above
1.4 R9 provide the radial dependence of the heating rates and constrain the parameters of reconnection-
based solar Wind models (Fisk 2003; Antiochos et al. 2011). CPI Will also have the sensitivity to identify
rapid thermal changes associated With the postulated ﬁeld-line motions in jet-like reconnection events that
are detected closer to the disk With instruments like AIA/SDO and IRIS (e.g., Yang et al. 2011).

How do plasma properties and magnetic ﬁeld lines connect from the photosphere t0 the heliosphere? A
key goal of space weather prediction is the ability to map magnetic ﬁeld from the Sun to 1 AU. Currently
this is done by using disk images and magnetograms (e.g., MDI/SOHO and HMI/SDO) as lower boundary
conditions and in situ particle and ﬁeld data to test the results of MHD models. CPI makes possible a more
complete picture of this 3D system by providing the “missing link” between data at 1 R9 and 1 AU. It
also aids in the interpretation of inner heliospherio measurements by Solar Probe Plus and Solar Orbiter
by probing the plasma properties in the Wind’s acceleration region. The stable coronal structure at solar
minimum will permit tomographic reconstruction of these plasma properties (Panasyuk et al. 1999; Frazin
et al. 2009; van der Holst et al. 2010), so that global MHD models can be better tested and reﬁned. CPI also
provides elemental abundance and charge state data for minor ions, Which is another way to trace the origin
of in situ solar Wind streams (e.g., Ko et al. 2006; Zurbuchen 2007). CPI Will build up an unprecedented
database of abundance maps that Will test models of fractionation and the First Ionization Potential (FIP)
effect from gravitational settling (Lenz 2004) and MHD waves (Laming 2009).

3. The CPI Science Payload
3.1. Instrumentation Overview

The CPI Science Payload (SP) is comprised of the Coronagraph-Spectrometer Unit (CSU), the Gimbals
Pointing Unit (GPU), and the Remote Electronics Unit (REU); see Figure 3. The CSU is further comprised
of the Telescope Assembly (TA) and the Spectrometer Assembly (SPA). The TA feeds light to the SPA,
Which consists of a toric dual-grating spectrometer With an intensiﬁed CCD (ICCD) detection system. The
SP has two optical paths: the EUV path (EUVP) for spectroscopy at 680—126 nm, and the He II path (HeP)
for spectroscopy at 495—84 11m (1st order) and 25.74120 11m (2nd order). It obtains high resolution spectra
of spatial regions as small as 4.5” . The ﬁeld of View is shown in Figure 4.

A key capability of CPI is that it facilitates determination and removal of the stray light spectrum for
each observed height With solar disk observations sealed with the intensities of isolated stray light spectral
features observed during coronal measurements.

The CSU optical layout is shown in Figure 5. Light enters through the 16.8 cm diameter Entrance
Aperture (EA) and falls on the Telescope Mirror (TM), Which is under—ﬁlled for both the solar disk and

coronal radiation. One half of the mirror surface is SiC for illumination of the EUV path and the other half
is coated With Si/Mo-Ir for the He II path. For coronal observations, the GPU and TM place an image of
the disk on the Solar Disk Light Trap, Which is elongated in the radial direction to allow coronal images
at heights of 1.4 to 3.5 R6 to be centered on the SPA Entrance Slit. This light trap is similar to that of
UVCS/Spartan (Kohl et al. 1994, 2006) and consists of a polished high-reﬂeetance mirror at an oblique
angle that reﬂects the direct solar disk radiation into a blackened cavity With elose-paeked 5 mm diameter
tubes. The mirror forms a 1.7 times magniﬁed image of the EA at 136 cm, Which is beyond the SPA Entrance
Slit and Gratings. Most of this light is intercepted by the slit jaws, and the portion that passes through the
slit is intercepted by a light trap that is located just in front of the gratings and surrounds them. There are
bafﬂes between the entrance aperture and telescope mirror, and all non-optieal surfaces in the telescope are
designed to attenuate stray light. There is no CPI hardware Sunward of the EA.

The Torie Dual-Grating Spectrometer has an Entrance Slit mechanism With 5 selectable slits of varying
Widths and a set of three slits for simultaneous observations at multiple heights. Coronal light passes through
the slit and onto two toric gratings, one for each light path. The gratings act nearly as one optic. The grating
size is chosen to not accept any light that contributes to the image of the Entrance Aperture including
diffraction of that light by the slit, as well as to not accept light from the outer portion of the mirror that
would have unacceptable imaging properties. The gratings are slightly tilted With respect to one another
in the perpendicular to dispersion direction, so that their focal planes are offset by 2.0 mm at the detector.
They are oriented in the dispersion direction to minimize overlap between the coronal lines of the two paths.
There is a grating drive that is used to optimize image/speetral quality for spectral lines near the outer limits
of the EUV wavelength range, and also to facilitate avoidance of any detector imperfections. The pivot aXis
is 4.09 cm from the center of the grating surface. The SPA has light traps for zero order and for intercepting
light from the Entrance Aperture edges as well as a bafﬂe located between the gratings and the detector to
ensure that the detector only Views rays from the gratings.

Optical performance of CPI was modeled With ZEMAX and is illustrated for the EUV path in Figure 6.
The HeP performance also meets all of the requirements. CPI provides a tremendous improvement in count
rates over UVCS/SOHO for the portion of the CPI wavelength range covered by UVCS (e.g., factors of
200, 40, and 20 at 1.4, 1.8, and 2.5 RQ, respectively for observations of 0 VI 103.2 nm). This is the result
of a greatly increased unVignetted telescope area and improved reﬂective coatings and detector counting
efﬁciency.

grating include all rays from the EA.
3.2. Stray Light Suppression
Stray light suppression is sufﬁcient for all required observations (see Figure 7). The fundamental and
dominant source of stray light is due to diffraction by the ﬁnite size of the entrance aperture and telescope
mirror. To minimize this diffraction, the entrance aperture and mirror are oversized so that the focal ratio
is much smaller (f/2.5) than the focal ratio of the gratings (effective focal ratio of f/7). In this way, the
diffracted light from the mirror that passes through the SPA slit and onto the gratings can be reduced
approximately in proportion to the diameter of the entrance aperture. Other sources of stray light are made
negligible with careful design. Direct solar-disk light is speeularly reﬂected off the telescope mirror and
imaged onto the Solar Disk Light Trap, Which reduces it to negligible levels. Solar disk radiation that
encounters particulate contamination on the reﬂecting surface of the telescope primary has been shown to
be controllable to negligible levels. Scattering due to mirror ﬁgure errors and mieroroughness are reduced
to near negligible levels. Observational lines of sight are restricted such that glints off surfaces of the
ISS illuminate the EA at large (> 100) angles. This prevents any glint light from falling on the portion
of the telescope mirror that has straight-line or slit-diffraeted paths to the gratings. Baﬂies on the TA

structure effectively eliminate glints that enter the EA at angles that miss the mirror. It is also necessary
to reduce the solar disk light at wavelengths outside the band pass of the spectrometer. This off—band
radiation is eliminated by the diffraction gratings for wavelengths shortward of 180 nm. Suppression at
longer wavelengths, Where the solar disk intensity is extremely high, is provided by a combination of the
oeeulting system, the diffraction grating, and the low sensitivity of the ICCD detector.

Stray light Characterization and removal Will be accomplished With a combination of a stray light model
together With laboratory stray light Characterization, and during the mission, observations of the solar disk
spectrum and direct detection of spectral features known to be due solely to stray light. The model Will be
reﬁned during the instrument development. At this time, the stray light levels have been computed With a

9

"10","series of empirically validated models that veriﬁed that the dominate contributor is ﬁnite-aperture diffraction
from the entrance aperture. The other possible sources of stray light were found to be controllable and can
be made negligible. A simple parameterized model of non-speeular stray light was used to predict the
expected stray light levels. The results of this analysis are provided in Figure 7. This model, which was
validated by adapting it to the geometry and optical properties of UVCS/SOHO, predicts a level of stray
light that agrees with in-ﬁight measurements (see Cranmer et al. 2010). The model was used to determine
preliminary mieroroughness and ﬁgure error speciﬁcations for the TM.

Modeling indicates that for most spectral lines of interest, the ratio of the coronal signal to the stray light
will be sufﬁcient to achieve the science goals with a minimum background analysis. However, for some
important lines, CPI will be required to accept and remove stray light levels that are comparatively high; for
example, reaching an estimated level of 1:1.5 eorona-to—stray light ratio at 1.8 R9 for H I Lya and He II
30.4 nm in coronal holes.

The Characterization and removal of the stray light background will use a combination of the synchronous
solar disk observations (with a reduced aperture to bring the count rate within the dynamic range of the
ICCD detector), the measurements of spectral features produced solely by stray light, and coronal hole
observations above 2.5 R9, which will be almost entirely stray light in the ease of H I Lya and He II 30.4
nm. Laboratory stray light calibration data will be used to extrapolate stray light contributions to lower
altitudes, and to determine the stray light level as a function of the origin of the light on the disk and the
observed height above the solar limb in order to verify parameters in the stray light model, which in turn
will be used with in-ﬁight solar disk observations to weight the stray light contributions from various parts
of the disk. All observations will be modeled as a combination of coronal emission, stray light, and detector
background. In addition, H I Lya observations will include a model of geoeoronal emission and absorption.
All the components except coronal emission have well known or separately measurable spectral shapes. The
relative contributions of the components will be varied to achieve the best ﬁt to the observed data, but the
range of their variation will be highly constrained by the laboratory stray light model, the measured stray
light spectral features, and the solar disk spectrum (as well as, in the ease of H I Lya, a geoeoronal model
similar to the one used for the UVCS/Spartan (Kohl et al. 1996).

Coronal emission will be modeled as a combination of a Gaussian core and high-veloeity wings, cor-
responding to electron scattering and possibly suprathermal particle scattering. The Characteristic spectral
widths of the coronal emission components are signiﬁcantly higher than the rest of the contributing features,
which facilitates high-preeision component separation. In summary, because (1) a high quality advance
knowledge of the stray light Characterization will exist, (2) measurements of the stray light will eXist at
nearby wavelengths, and (3) very recent measurements of the solar disk spectrum with the same instruments
will exist, then model ﬁtting with a very limited number of highly constrained “free parameters” will result
in the stray light removal procedure being extremely robust. The precision of the coronal proﬁle recovery is
expected to be at the level of 5% or better, even for signal to stray light ratios of greater than 1:1.5.

3.3. [C CD Detector

The detector consists of a 40 mm diameter mieroehannel plate (MCP) intensiﬁer with a ﬁber optic output
window optically coupled to a CCD. The MCP is coated with KBr. The intensiﬁer includes a vacuum door
and non-ﬁight 2 liter/s ion pump. This detector has a high teehnieal reliability since it is essentially the
same technology that the Mullard Space Science Laboratory (MSSL) used for the ICCD detectors 0n Swift
(Reming et al. 2000) and XMM/Newton (Mason et al. 2001). Following assembly, the detector is maintained
under vacuum to prevent deterioration of the photoeathode. A grid/aperture in front of the MCP repels low
energy ions. The grid is set to ~100 V, and is adjustable in ﬂight.

Individual photoelectrons are produced at the MCP surface and multiplied through its pores. Exiting
electrons are accelerated onto a phosphor sereen coupled to a CCD Chip using a 3.5:1 ﬁber optic taper. Each

10

"
"11","photoelectron results in a “splash” of light on a 3 pixel area of the CCD. The light splash is eentroided to 0.25
pixels (spectral only), improving the resolution. A 1024 X 256 Window is read out, allowing an increased
frame rate.

If two events land in the same 3 X 3 pixel area during an exposure, the two events can be identiﬁed using
a combination of pulse height and position information, and are both rejected from the image (although
retained in a count register). To minimize this effect, the CCD is clocked at the maximum frame rate. The
maximum acceptable count rate for CPI of 5.6 eounts/s at a 50% loss rate is somewhat increased by two
factors:

a. The position resolution required in the spatial dimension is less critical than in the spectral dimension.
This gives some relaxation in the proximity of events in that axis, Where eentroiding is not required.

b. The maximum count rates are at the peaks of spectral lines. The shoulders and base of the lines are Within
3 CCD pixels, so that the average count rate over 3 pixels is lower than at the peak. This effect allows a
higher maximum count rate for the disk observations compared to the coronal observations: lines on the
disk are narrower, and so a higher peak count rate can be tolerated because the adj aeent areas Within the
3-CCD-pixel Width have a lower rate.

3.4. Line ofSight Pointing System (LOSPS)

The tracking and pointing 0f the CPI Coronagraph Spectrometer Unit is provided by the Gimbals Pointing
Unit (GPU) and a Telescope Mirror Pointing Subassembly (MP8). The GPU provides the coarse tracking
of the Sun across the sky during orbital day, and the ﬁne pointing 0f the instrument so that the solar disk
image falls on the Solar Disk Light Trap and the coronal region of interest falls on the spectrometer entrance
slit. The CSU is mounted in a Roll Axis Assembly that provides rotation of the CPI ﬁeld of View about the
Sun-eenter axis to place the image of the selected position angle axis on the center of the spectrometer slit.
The Roll Axis Assembly is mounted in a yoke that provides rotation in the elevation axis, and the yoke is
mounted on an Azimuth Assembly that provides rotation about the axis that is perpendicular to the elevation
axis. Low frequency disturbances are removed by the GPU. Higher frequency Vibrations over the small
amplitudes expected on ISS are compensated With motions of the telescope mirror provided by the MPS.
L-3 Com Integrated Optical Systems is highly experienced in such systems, having developed similar ones
for the WISE, HIRDLS, GIF T S, and GOES—R AB] missions.

4. Science Payload Accommodation 011 ISS

ISS engineers at J SC have provided a preliminary conﬁrmation that the CPI accommodation requirements
are compatible With the ISS.

4.]. [SS External Research Accommodation Sites Characteristics

The primary ISS site for CPI is the Columbus Starboard Overhead Zenith (802) site. This is the
Columbus External Payload Facility zenith position Which has been used for the Columbus SOLAR payload.
The CPI accommodation requirements are well Within the allowable SP mass, power, SP volume, and
telemetry rates speciﬁcations for this site. Mounting, power, and data interfaces are standardized 0n pallet
plates that ease mounting, robotic handling, and installation (e.g., the Columbus standard cargo interface
called the Flight Releasable Attachment Mechanism; FRAM). After installation, the ISS provides data
up/downlink and command and control Via a standard interface at MSFC. At the end of the instrument’s
lifetime, an established ISS procedure removes the payload and transports it for safe discard.

"12","4.2. CPI [SS Resource Requirements

188 capability provides a 54% reserve in addition to the CPI requirement for mass and 376% for power.
CPI ﬁts in the Columbus 802 site and transport volume With ample reserves. The CPI data rate and data
capacity requirements are less than 2% 0f the ISS capable data rate for both S and K band transmitter sys-
tems. Thermal ISS interfaces are capable of supporting CPI requirements. 188 contamination experts have
informed us that the 188 is compatible With the CPI particulate and molecular contamination requirements
as long as CPI follows its plan to never point at an ISS structure and to always Close its Entrance Aperture
Door during high contamination periods, Which occur less than a few percent of the time.

4.3. [SS Orbit and T rajectories

The 188 ram direction is the x axis, the zenith is the z axis, and the orthogonal axis is y. The current
188 altitude varies from 350 to 460 km and is expected to increase to an average of 450 km prior to CPI
operations. Atmospheric absorption Will allow scientiﬁc observations to commence before the Sun vector
reaches the xy plane. After consultation With the ISS MAGIK team, we calculate a typical minimum solar
Viewing time at $02 of 35 minutes per orbit for at least 85% 0f the orbits plus 5 minutes for acquisition
during the 190 below the xy plane. These calculations account for a 100 unobstructed exclusion Window
about our line of sight (LOS). Observations begin When the Sun angle reaches the ISS xy plane and continue
past the ISS yz plane for a total angle of ~137O. The 6 angle is deﬁned as the angle between the orbit plane
(188 x2 plane) and the vector from the Sun (e.g., 6 = 0 When the Sun is in the ISS x2 plane and +900 When it
is in the ISS yz plane 011 the starboard side). For 6 from O to +400 our Viewing time is ~40 minutes and for O
to 400 it is ~35 minutes due to a truss obstruction 011 the port side and an ISS module structure to the rear.
At 6 angles of $550, we are limited by solar array obstructions and so there Will be 110 CPI observations
at 6 exceeding these angles. Preliminary review of the JEM site #3 indicates that it is nearly equivalent to
$02.

5. Mission Overview
5.]. Mission Design

CPI is an Explorer Small Complete Mission intended for the International Space Station (188). The
baseline 188 site is the Columbus EPF Starboard Overhead Zenith (802) site, and the alternate site is JEM-
EF EFU #3. CPI utilizes the ISS resources for transport to the site, attachment Via the robotic arm, and for
188 provided telemetry links. The nominal launch date is 1 September 2017. On-orbit Checkout continues
for two months, followed by 24 months of coronal and solar disk observations. CPI Will acquire the Sun at
the start of orbital day, starting observations after 5 minutes, and continuing them for about 35 minutes or
more. The current average orbital altitude is 400 km and is expected to have increased at the time of CPI
operations after the NASA Space Transportation System is retired. The Sun traj eetory rises rapidly in the sky
during orbital day, providing minimal atmospheric absorption during the observation period. It is estimated
that 188 Will provide 310 days per year With 16 orbits per day and at least 35 minutes of solar observations
(not including 5 minutes for Sun acquisition) per orbit. 188 is well suited to solar experiments because
the solar panels are normally aimed at the Sun and out of the line of sight of solar-Viewing instruments.
188 engineers assure us that the contamination environment meets the stringent requirements of CPI, but
precautions must be taken to not point CPI at the 188 surfaces, and to Close its aperture door at times of
contamination release and the presence of transport vehicles. A three-year extended mission is proposed.
The entire SP Will be designed to meet ISS hardware disposal requirements.

12

"
"13","5.2. Operations, Data Policy, and Data Archiving

The Science Operations Center Will be located at the Smithsonian Astrophysical Observatory (SAO).
Ground software Will be provided by SAO and based on the command software it developed and used for
UVCS/SOHO. The command and telemetry link to the 188 Will be provided by the ISS Payload Operations
Center (POC) at MSFC. The SAO command software Will be upgraded to support communication protocols
of the MSFC command and telemetry software that is to be provided to SAO.

CPI will follow NASA’s Heliophysios Science Data Management Policy guidelines to make the science
data publicly available as quickly as possible. Validated science data Will be distributed Via the Internet
directly from SAO and through the Virtual Solar Observatory With assistance from GSFC’s SDA. Level 1
data Will be distributed Within one month of the time When the data are available to SAO. This Will ensure
Wide dissemination of all CPI data products to the science community.

The validated CPI data products—including associated documentation on calibration methods—Will be
submitted to the appropriate NSSDC archive as they become available. Level 2 data, calibrated With the best
and ﬁnal calibration parameters, Will be provided during the last month of the primary mission.

5.3. Guest Investigator Program

The CPI science team Will support an active Guest Investigator (GI) Program during both the primary
baseline mission and its continuation to the extent desired by NASA/SMD. It is envisioned that an an-
nouncement of opportunity Will be released shortly after launch that would consider a broad range of guest
participation in the CPI Investigation, supported by about 15 grants per year. These programs Will be selected
Via a rigorous NASA peer review process With the goal of broadly complementing the core team science. GIs
Will be treated exactly as CPI Co-Investigators, including any desired participation in observation planning.

6. The CPI Team, Management, and Costs
6.1. The CPI Team

The CPI Project is a collaborative effort under the direction of J ohn Kohl, the Principal Investigator, in-
volving a core scientiﬁc team from SAO, the University of Montana, and the University of New Hampshire.
The PI has delegated the authority to manage the CPI project to the Project Manager, Timothy Norton. The
Mission Systems Engineer is Peter Daigneau. George Nystrom Will lead the project-level reviews team.
The industrial partner is L-3 Communications Integrated Optical Systems (L-3 LOS). Paul Cucohiaro Will
be the Payload Project Manager for L-3 Com, and Mark Schwalm Will be the Payload Systems Engineer.
L-3 LOS and its collaborating L-3 Com organizations are highly experienced in the development of space
instrumentation and 188 systems and integration, With over 30 years of experience and a 100% success rate
on 50+ space ﬂight payloads. It has developed and ﬁelded space-based gimbals, pointing mirrors, SiC UV
optics, and grating spectrometers, providing high technical readiness levels against the CPI payload needs.
L-3 LOS supported important NASA missions, including gimbaled optical systems for WISE, HIRDLS,
GIF T S, and GOES-R AB], and SiC optical systems for MICSAS, ALI, HIRDLS, LORRI, and GOES-R AB].
L-3 108 Will build the CPI Science Payload drawing on its Tinsley Laboratories facility for aspheric optics
and L-3 Communications Systems East (L-3 CSE) for interface expertise With the ISS. L-3 CSE was the
primary contractor for the ISS communications and telemetry system With over $600M in contracts. The
CPI ICCD detector system Will be procured from Mullard Space Science Laboratory, Which cooperated in
producing the CPI proposal.

The CPI Science Team includes Dan Reisenfeld Who Will act as Project Scientist and be responsible for
scientiﬁc oversight of the CPI development, lead the laboratory and in-ﬂight calibration and characterization

13

"
"14","effort including scientiﬁc performance tests, and participate in the data analysis. Paul Janzen will be the
Instrument Scientist and will be responsible for carrying out the optical design and performance evaluation
as well as the laboratory and in-ﬂight calibrations and characterizations. Steven Cranmer will act as Mission
Scientist for Solar Wind Science and John Raymond will be the Mission Scientist for CME Science. The
CPI Core Science Analysis Team will be greatly strengthened by Ben Chandran, Terry Forbes, Alexander
Panasyuk, Phil Isenberg, and Aad van Ballegooijen. In addition to data analysis, Alexander Panasyuk will
develop the ground software and head the science operations team.
6.2. T echnical Readiness Level and Risks

CPI will be built with existing technology that has extensive heritage. It has no medium or high risks.

The Technical Readiness Levels (TRLs) of all CPI hardware is at level 9 or higher.
6.3. Technical Reserves, Cost Reserves, and Margin

Due to the substantial resource capabilities of 188, mass, power, volume, and telemetry reserves are robust
with 54% reserves + margin for mass, 376% for power, 1000% for uplink and downlink and a factor of 2 for
pointing.

The CPI budget includes seven months of costed schedule reserve in addition to a schedule that provides
48 months from the start of phase B to the nominal launch date. On top of all PI-Mission Costs and
encumbered reserves, there are unencumbered reserves of 25% for phases A/B/C/D leaving 5% margin
to the Mission Cost Cap. CPI has a robust descope plan with descopes across the project that would
save approximately $4M. The descopes increase risk by removing redundancy and by using a lower TRL
command and data handling system, but the science impact is minimal. Phase E would be shortened by
10% and loss in performance of optical reﬂection and detector efﬁciency would be accepted. CPI has no
foreign collaborations, contributions, or costs. The ICCD detector system arrangement is a procurement,
not an international collaboration.
