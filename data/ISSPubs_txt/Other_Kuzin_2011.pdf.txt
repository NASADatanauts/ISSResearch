Abstract—Observing the Sun’s hot corona with sub—second spatial resolution is important in solving a num—
ber of basic solar physics problems. The new ARCA satellite observatory under development at the LebedeV
Physical Institute, Russian Academy of Sciences, will be ﬁrst to provide images of the hot solar corona with a spa—
tial resolution of about 0.18 arcsec. Scientiﬁc and technical features of the observatory are discussed.
