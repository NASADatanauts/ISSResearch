Abstract—Age—related hemodynamic reactions to the standard incremental physical loading tests on a cycle
ergometer were assessed in cosmonauts before and during extended space missions. Analysis of the data from
353 tests performed with 63 cosmonauts differentiated into three age groups (30—39, 40—49, and 50—55 years
old) showed changes in adaptive—compensatory hemodynamic responses to microgravity and physical load—
ing depending on age. The consistent gradual degradation of the heart chronotropic function with age can be
interpreted as a symptom of declining cardiovascular reactivity. In orbit, the cardiac output volume depended
mainly on heart rate and blood pressure (i.e. , vascular tone).
