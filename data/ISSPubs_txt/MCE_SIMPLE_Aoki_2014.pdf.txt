SIMPLE (Space Inﬂatable Membranes Pioneering Long-term Experiments) is one of the ﬁve mission payloads of
MCE (Multi-mission Consolidated Equipment), which is among the series of Expose Facility experiments on Japan
Experiment Module (JEM) in 188 (International Space Station). MCE was launched on board HTV-3 in July 2012 and was
installed to the Exposure Facility. Following the checkout operations of the MCE, SIMPLE bus system went under initial
workout. SIMPLE consists of three experimental sub-mission equipments: IEM (Inﬂatable Extension Mast), IST (Inﬂatable
Space Terrarium), and IMP (Inﬂatable Material Panel). After the initial workout of the SIMPLE equipment, the extension
of IBM was performed on August 17, 2012, followed by the deployment of IST, and the start-up of IMP monitoring, all in
success. The details of the sequence throughout the development to initial on-orbit experimental phase of the SIMPLE
project are given. The experiments are now under way in the steady operational phase. The current status and issues are
brieﬂy outlined.

component within the current inﬂatable experiments. The final
extension was confirmed and the minimum success has been

g Criteria of full success were, for IBM; (1) to maintain the

within 20% deviation of the predicted value in the same

0.8 ~ 1.1 atm and being able to withstand that pressure, and
(4) to maintain its conﬁguration for 6 months, and for IMP;

5. Conclusions
The overview of the SIMPLE (Space Inﬂatable Membranes
Pioneering Long-term Experiments) is given after the passage
of successﬁal planning, development, fabrication and initial
operation phases. Three different types of sub-mission are
brieﬂy introduced and the preliminary outcomes of the proj ect
are shown. The most important objective of the experiment,
which is to demonstrate the realizing ability and useﬁalness 0f
the inﬂatable structures, has been attained with trial and errors
of the project members. Though the structures adopted in the
experiments are physically 0f diminutive sizes, the concepts
are well applicable to the ﬁll size structures in demand. For
example, the IBM extension was limited in length due to the
operational limitation of the 188. The deployed length may be
increased by the extension of STEM beams along with the
extension of driving inﬂatable tube and augmentation of
corresponding operational gas volume.
The in-orbit experiments will last at least for another year
and a half. The detailed results of these experiments will
deﬁnitely be presented in the near ﬁJture.
