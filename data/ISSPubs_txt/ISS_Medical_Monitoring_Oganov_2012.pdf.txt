Abstract—The densitometry 0f cosmonauts after long—term missions shows a reduction ofbone mineral den-
sity (BMD). On average, the postﬂight BMD remains within the normal range and the broad variability of
individual BMD values is sometimes regarded as local osteoperlia. Individual reactions are classiﬁed by the
similarity of amount and rate of BMD loss.
Today, the analysis of functionally signiﬁcant polymorphism of bone metabolism genes is the most effective
tool for diagnosing susceptibility to osteopenia and osteoporosis. The study was aimed at analyzing the poly-
morphism for genes ofvitamin D (VDR) and calcitonin (CALCR) receptors, as well as the collagen-l alpha-
1 chain (Collal) in candidate cosmonauts and cosmonauts returned from 5- t0 7-month missions.
The results of the analysis showed that, in the majority of cosmonauts, a rapid BMD loss correlated with the
T T genotype for the VDR gene, but not with T t and It genotypes, and was associated with the carriage of an
incomplete s—allele in the Calla] gene. However, in several cases, high BMD loss rates were personiﬁed with
the carriers of the VDR gene alleles (in homozygous and heterozygote states, It and T t) and the heterozygote
for the Calla] gene (SS).
