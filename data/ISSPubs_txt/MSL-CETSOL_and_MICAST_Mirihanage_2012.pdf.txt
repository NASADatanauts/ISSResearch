Abstract. This paper presents a numerical simulation of a directional solidification experiment,
which was conducted in microgravity conditions in the Material Science Lab (MSL) onboard
the International Space Station. Solidification of an A1—7wt.%Si alloy in the Low Gradient
Furnace (LGF) was investigated. The LGF is a Bridgman—type furnace insert for the MSL,
consisting of two heated cavities separated by an insulated adiabatic zone. The simulation
results include the prediction of Columnar t0 Equiaxed Transition (CET) and average as—cast
equiaxed grain diameters. A front tracking algorithm was employed to track the growing
columnar dendrite front while a volume averaging method was used to model equiaxed
nucleation, growth and impingement. The thermal boundary conditions for the simulation
domain were defined and computed Via temperature readings that were recorded during the
experiment. The experimental data were obtained from a number of thermocouples that were
attached to the crucible of the sample cartridge assembly. To conclude, the microgravity
experimental results and the model simulation results, including the CET, are compared.
1. Introduction
Metal casting was first developed more as a craft than a science. Solidification of cast metals involves
many physical phenomena and this makes casting processes very complex to understand. The effects
of gravity in the solidifying melt are one of the major sources of complication. Natural convection and
buoyancy—related effects (as a result of gravity), that are present in solidifying liquid alloys, can
significantly modify or mask important physical mechanisms of heat, mass and species transport. For
example, macrosegregation in cast components is identified as such a direct effect [1].

In a typical casting we can generally distinguish two different types of dendrites: columnar and
equiaxed. The columnar dendrites are recognizable Via their large aspect ratio and elongated shape.
Equiaxed dendrites have a lower aspect ratio than columnar ones, and have random crystal
orientations. The transition of the macrostructure of a casting from columnar t0 equiaxed is termed as
the columnar t0 equiaxed transition (CET). CET is an important phenomenon, which strongly affects
the properties of cast components. Columnar dendrites usually originate at the mould walls and grow
in a direction parallel with, but in the opposite direction to the heat flow. Equiaxed dendrites nucleate
within the bulk liquid, normally under relatively low temperature gradients. At some point in the

macrostructure formation, a CET will eXist if sufficient equiaxed dendrites nucleate and grow ahead of
the columnar dendrites, thus blocking their progress [2].

Many experimental studies [2] have been performed to study the CET under terrestrial conditions,
incorporating the extra complexity caused by gravity. However, only a very limited number of
solidification experiments have been conducted under microgravity conditions to study CET (for
examples refer to [3]). The European Space Agency has coordinated a specific Microgravity
Application Promotion (MAP) project called CETSOL (CET in SOLidification processing) to harness
microgravity conditions in the study of CET in alloy solidification [4]. The project objectives of the
CETSOL are to obtain both microgravity and terrestrial experimental results on CET formation
enabling validation of various modeling approaches. The Material Science Lab (MSL) onboard the
International Space Station (188) has recently been used as a microgravity platform for CETSOL
experiments. In this contribution, we present and compare numerical model simulation predictions
with the results of one of the directional solidification experiments conducted onboard ISS—MSL.

2. Experimental Setup

The LGF is a furnace insert that can be used in the MSL onboard ISS’s Destiny module. The MSL
consist primarily of a process chamber accommodating furnace inserts and the individual experiment
cartridges. Various furnace inserts and experiment cartridges allow for different types of materials
science experiments to be performed. LGF is a Bridgman—type furnace that can directionally move
relative to the Sample Cartridge Assembly (SCA), which contains the experimental sample. The LGF
is equipped with seven heating elements. Every single one is independently controlled Via a
thermocouple placed in the centre of diffusers made of carbon fibre reinforced material. The heaters
are used to establish a temperature gradient and are separated by an adiabatic zone.

An SCA consists of a cartridge head and a sealed cylindrical sample compartment (cartridge tube).
The SCA head mainly contains the electrical connections but no software and no complex electronics
are included in the SCA. The SCA sample compartment is a sealed metal cylinder (the cartridge tube),
primarily containing the experiment—specific sample within a ceramic crucible. Furthermore, 12
thermocouples (TCs) are attached to the crucible, fixed at 10 mm intervals in the mid section of the
sample. The compartment outer body is a tantalum tube, closed by a welded hot end cap on one side,
with a stainless steel support, and a stainless steel feed—through (at the cold side). The schematic setup
of the LGF and SCA with dimensions is given in figure 1. SiX experiments have already been
conducted onboard the ISS, and one will be carried out as a terrestrial experiment as well. One of the
experiments (named here as FM2) is presented in this paper.

For the experiment, the furnace was initially moved from the right to the left (in the opposite direction
to the arrows in figure 1) to melt the sample. Retaining the furnace at the left—most position for a long
time period allowed the temperatures to reach steady state. Thereafter, the furnace was moved from
left to right initially at the speed of 0.01 mm/s for 2000s, and then at a speed 0.2 mm/s for 250s
creating two velocity regimes. Temperature readings from the thermocouples attached to the sample
crucible (thermocouple no.1 is the leftmost one) were electronically recorded during the experiment,
together with furnace displacement. Table 1 presents the chemical composition of the sample.

3. Solidification Model

An approach that combines Front Tracking (FT) of columnar growth [5] and an equiaxed volume
averaging method [6] was employed to model the experiment. Among the key advantages related to
this approach are: the ability to explicitly track the undercooled columnar front; the feasibility to
model equiaxed nucleation from grain refiners; high computational efficiency for modeling equiaxed
solidification in this range of equiaxed grain sizes; and the macroscopic nature of CET. Furthermore,
we have already demonstrated the ability to integrate effects of gravity [7]. Therefore, the model will
be extended and applied to simulate and analyse the other microgravity and identical terrestrial
experiments (with same MSL—LGF modeling approach), which are planned as part of the CETSOL
project.

The combined model needs to solve the energy equation with the latent heat source term as
follows,

aT _ afs 1
,OCp 6t V(KVT)+L (9t ()
where ,0 is density, K thermal conductivity; Cp specific heat; fs solid volume fraction, and T and t
denote the temperature and time, respectively.

The columnar growth initiation from initial solid/mush is considered. The model tracks the
evolution of the columnar dendrite front over the solidification period. In this simulation, the columnar
front is assumed to commence its growth from the mushy zone (at liquidus isotherm 0f the Al—7%Si
alloy) that eXists when cooling (solidification) begins. Therefore, the initial position of the columnar
makers (front) was placed at the computed temperature profile’s liquidus isotherm.

In an undercooled liquid, ahead of the columnar front, the possibility of equiaxed nucleation from
grain refiners is considered. It has been shown [8] that TiB2 grain refiner particles with diameter d in
typical aluminum alloys follow a log—normal size distribution, which can be presented mathematically
as follows, when 0 and q) are the standard deviation and the geometric mean of the distribution,
respectively:

where ASV is the volumetric entropy of fusion and y is the solid—liquid interfacial energy. When these
data are available, equiaxed nucleation, growth and impingement was computed by integrating the
volume averaged equiaxed solidification model presented in [6].

The simulation domain is a 132 mm long section from the experimental sample and starts at
position z = 61.5 (Z is measured from the leftmost end of the sample). To define the thermal boundary
conditions for the simulations, thermal data recorded during the experiment on the 188 was used. As
mentioned in section 2., thermal data is collected from 12 thermocouple positions at every 10 seconds
interval. Intermediate spatial and temporal input data values that are used to feed the model simulation
were linearly interpolated. It was assumed that all boron atoms are contained in TiB2 particles, which
makes TiB2 ppm value equals to 15. According to the literature [8, 9], 1 ppt TiB2 in Al—7%Si makes
8.6X1012 particles in one cubic metre. The figure 15 ppm is therefore equivalent to 129 particles per
mm3 . Considering the maximum 1% efficiency of TiB2 grain refiners, this value was normalised t0 the
effective value of 1.25 particles per mm3. A 3D unit depth relevant to the 2D modeling domain, 8 X
132 mm, will therefore contain approximately 1320 effective grain refiner particles. However our
model is 2D, and we have assumed that grains nucleated within a thin slice (equal to the approximate
grain radius) can contribute to our apparent simulated microstructure. Therefore, the input grain
refiner density for 2D model is obtained Via multiplying the 3D grain refiner density value by a factor
equal to 0.75rnrn'1 (it was assumed that a slice with thickness equal to half of the average equiaxed
dendrite diameter contributes to the 2D View; the as—cast average equiaxed dendrite diameter is in the
range of 1.5mm). Thus, a total of 990 equally spread grain refiner particles were employed for the
model simulation as potential equiaxed nucleation sites. Thermo—physical data related to TiB2 particles
and typical particle size distribution of TiB2 inoculants were obtained from [8] while alloy related
thermo—physical properties and undercooling—dendrite tip growth speed relationship were taken from
ref. [10].

The grid size for the simulation presented here was 2mm X 2mm. To test the grid size sensitivity of
the model, other simulations were run using different control volume sizes (ranging from 8mm2 t0
1mm2) of rectangular or square shape, and the overall outcome (predicted CET position) was quite
consistent. However, very large control volumes were not considered because (i) a coarser grid is
unable to correctly represent the thermal gradient in the radial direction of the 8mm diameter sample,
and (ii) control volume sizes should not be too small compared to the average equiaxed grain size, in
order to maintain a physically realistic model.

4. Results
After the experiment, a space shuttle mission downloaded the SCA back to earth and the
microstructure of the solidified sample was revealed. Microstructure and grain structure of the aXial
cross sections of the solidified sample is presented in figure 2.

The thermal data collected during the experiment was used as the input data for the model simulation.
Before solidification begins, the initial (the first time step) liquid/solid positions from the model are

5. Discussion
As seen in figure 2, three solid zones were distinguishable along the length of the as—cast cross section
of the sample, namely: (a) the un—melted solid; (b)—(c) a partially—stabilized Temperature Gradient
Zone Melted (TGZM) section, and (b)—(d) the as—cast solidified structure. The boundary between each
section along the sample was nearly planar and transverse to the central aXis. The TGZM section,
which was formed from a semi—solid region, developed through melting and the temperature holding
period prior to solidification. The temperature holding period for this experiment was around 200
minutes and this time is assumed to be reasonable in order to have a fully stabilized TGZM region.
Figure 2(b) shows the sample section that contains the end of the TGZM zone and the beginning of the
solidification zone. The boundary between the two is at a distance z of approximately 110 mm. At the
very first time step of the simulation, the columnar front lies at approximately 50 mm distance from
the simulation domain’s cold end (see figure 3). The simulation domain starts at z = 61.5 mm. Hence
the difference between z distances and ‘X’ aXis position of the simulation results is 61.5 mm.
Therefore, the agreement between experiment (approx. z = 110 mm) and simulation (approx. 50 mm)
is reasonably good, and suggests that the model can represent the thermal environment that develops
in the sample accurately.

During the solidification, the columnar front advances forward and an undercooled liquid zone
develops ahead the front, thus facilitating equiaxed nucleation. In the simulation, equiaxed nucleation
from grain refiners follows the free growth model [8]. In most castings grain refiner particles may be
engulfed 0r pushed by the growing solid liquid interface. So, these grain refiner particles cannot
initiate grains and normally end up in the grain boundaries [9]. Thus general grain refiner efficiency is
very low. It was found that the efficiency of the grain refiners is at a maximum when addition level is
low [8]. 15 ppm TiB2 is a relatively low grain refiner addition level, and it is reasonable to assume
near 1% maximum efficiency.

From the sample macrostructure examination, CET is at a distance (z) approximately 128 i 2 mm
(figure 2(0)). In the simulation, CET is predicted at a distance 66 mm from simulation cold end of the
domain (2 = 127.5 mm) and presented in figure 4. Hence the agreement between model simulation and

experiment is reasonably strong. The columnar length is approximately equal to the distance the
furnace is moving at a slower velocity and, therefore, it is possible to suggest that CET is related to the
velocity jump and resulting thermal regime change. However, the inﬂuences of grain refiners need to
be evaluated carefully. Another identical microgravity experiment (named FM3) under CETSOL MSL
campaign has been carried out without grain refiners, but also with nearly identical thermal conditions
to FM2. The experimental analyses of those samples are beyond the scope of this contribution and will
be the subject of future work. However, the basic analysis of microstructures has not shown CET,
rather completely columnar solidification, and signifies the importance of grain refiners to form an
equiaxed zone and CET — as in this experiment.

It was assumed that the 2D simulation represents the conditions in the 3D sample. However, there
may be some minor thermal differences arising, for example, in the latent heat terms. Therefore,
currently research is in progress to develop a model, which effectively represents the 3D system by
using axisymmetric co—ordinates.

6. Summary

Preliminary results of an MSL—LGF microgravity solidification experiment is presented together with

a CET prediction model. CET was observed in the solidified sample of Al—7%Si with grain refiners. A

combined model of columnar front tracking and equiaxed volume averaging that used the thermal data

collected during the experiment as input, is effectively employed to predict CET. Columnar front

progression was tracked employing the front tracking method, and equiaxed dendrite nucleation

criterion was based on free growth of equiaxed dendrites from grain refiner particles. Sample chemical

analysis data together with some information in previous literature was successfully used as realistic

input data to the model. Predicted CET position from the model simulation shows good agreement

with the experimental results.
