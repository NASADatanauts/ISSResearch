Abstract
DNA polymerase ti is involved in DNA repair, V(D)J recombination and likely somatic hypermutation of immunoglobulin
genes. Our previous studies demonstrated that spaceflight conditions affect immunoglobulin gene expression and somatic
hypermutation frequency. Consequently, we questioned whether Poln expression could also be affected. To address this
question, we characterized Poln of the Iberian ribbed newt Pleurodeles waltl and exposed embryos of that species to
spaceflight conditions or to environmental modifications corresponding to those encountered in the International Space
Station. We noted a robust expression of Poln mRNA during early ontogenesis and in the testis, suggesting that Poln is
involved in genomic stability. FuII—Iength Poln transcripts are 8—9 times more abundant in P. waltl than in humans and mice,
thereby providing an explanation for the somatic hypermutation predilection of G and C bases in amphibians. Poln
transcription decreases after 10 days of development in space and radiation seem primarily involved in this down—
regulation. However, space radiation, alone or in combination with a perturbation of the circadian rhythm, did not affect
Poln protein levels and did not induce protein oxidation, showing the limited impact of radiation encountered during a 10-
day stay in the International Space Station.

Figure 3. Effects of spaceflight conditions. Poltt mRNAs were quantified in larvae that developed in microgravity in the ISS (A), in hypergravity
(B), in the RPM to simulate microgravity (C) or in the dark (D). The same study was performed with larvae subjected to a mechanical stress (E) or the
ISS radiation environment (F). The effects of space radiation on DNA—PKC (G) and Gadd45 (H) mRNAs and on the amount of Pol“ protein (I and J)
were also investigated. Western blot results were analyzed and quantified by densitometry using a Fusion Fx7 imaging system (Vilber Lourmat,
Marne—Ia—Vallée, France) and Poltt expression was normalized to B—actin (J). Each lane of the western blot contains proteins from 3 larvae. Results are
expressed as the mean : SEM. “A.U.” stands for “arbitrary units”.
