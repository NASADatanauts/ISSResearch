Abstract
The attenuation of sedimentation and convection in microgravity can sometimes decrease irregularities formed during
macromolecular crystal growth. Current terrestrial protein crystal growth (PCG) capabilities are very different than
those used during the Shuttle era and that are currently on the International Space Station (ISS). The focus of this
experiment was to demonstrate the use of a commercial off—the-shelf, high throughput, PCG method in microgravity.
Using Protein BioSolutions’ microfluidic Plug MakerTM/CrystaICard TM system, we tested the ability to grow crystals of
the regulator of glucose metabolism and adipogenesis: peroxisome proliferator—activated receptor gamma (apo-
hPPAR-y LBD), as well as several PCG standards. Overall, we sent 25 CrystalCardsTM to the ISS, containing
~10,000 individual microgravity PCG experiments in a 3U NanoRacks NanoLab (1U = 103 cm.). After 70 days on the
ISS, our samples were returned with 16 of 25 (64%) microgravity cards having crystals, compared to 12 of 25 (48%)
of the ground controls. Encouragingly, there were more apo-hPPAR-y LBD crystals in the microgravity PCG cards
than the 19 controls. These positive results hope to introduce the use of the PCG standard of low sample volume and
large experimental density to the microgravity environment and provide new opportunities for macromolecular
samples that may crystallize poorly in standard laboratories.

Funding: The funders (NanoRacks, LLC) had no role in data collection and analysis, decision to publish, but were allowed to review the manuscript before
submission. They also had a role in how the CrystalCards would be inserted and kept in the NanoLab during flight. NanoRacks, LLC purchased and
provided the CrystalCards and frames, paid Emerald Biosystems (the owner of the Plug Maker system at the time) for the service of filling the cards using
the Plug Maker, provided the NanoLab and covered all launch service costs. Gerdts had a role in programming the Plug Maker and filling/freezing of the
Crystal Cards. Gerdts did not have a role in data interpretation and decision to publish. Gerdts did assist in editing the final draft of the manuscript.
