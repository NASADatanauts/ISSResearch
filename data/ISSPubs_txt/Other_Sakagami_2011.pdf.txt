Abstract. On January 22nd, 2011(JST), KOUNOTORI2 (H—II Transfer Vehicle: HTV2) was
successfully launched from Tanegashima Space Center toward the International Space Station
(188) and two new JAXA payload racks, Kobairo rack and MSPR (Multi-purpose Small
Payload Rack) were transferred to ISS/KIBO (Japanese Experiment Module: IBM). In addition
to Saibo rack and Ryutai rack which are already in operation in KIBO, in total 4 Japanese
experiment payload racks start Operations in KIBO. Then KIBO payload Operations embark on
a new realm, full utilization phase. While the number and variety of microgravity experiments
become increasing, simultaneous Operation constraints should be considered to achieve multi-
task payload operations in ISS/KIBO and ever more complicated cooperative Operations
between crewmember and ﬂight control teaIn/science team are required. Especially for g-jitter
improvement in ISS/KIBO, we have greatly advanced cooperative operations with
crewmember in the recent increment based on the microgravity data analysis results. In this
paper, newly Operating Japanese experiment payloads characteristics and some methods to
improve g-jitter environment are introduced from the ﬁont line of KIBO payload operations.
1. Introduction
Since August, 2008, utilizing two JAXA payload racks (SAIBO rack and RYUTAI rack), variety of
experiments have been performed in the International Space Station (ISS)/Japanese Experiment
Module (IBM), or KIBO. In addition, JAXA exposed payloads and NASA payload racks (MELF I and

Express Racks) are constantly in operating in KIBO. On January 22nd, 2011(JST), KOUNOTORI2
brought two new JAXA payload racks, KOBAIRO rack and MSPR (Multi-purpose Small Payload
Rack) t0 KIBO. Then KIBO payload operations embark on a new realm, full utilization phase.

In order to perform variety of experiments simultaneously in KIBO, the system resources of KIBO
such as power, coolant, communication and tracking, command and data handling, and some other
resources which experiment support equipments can provide, should be carefully planned and
delivered to each experiment payload. Moreover, it is important that microgravity environment should
be carefully controlled based on the microgravity data collection and analysis and cooperation
between crew and ﬂight control team are essential key to success for good microgravity environment
in a manned space system facility like ISS/KIBO. JAXA ﬂight control team, microgravity analysis
team and Marangoni experiment science team have been continuing an effort to achieve good
microgravity environment in ISS/KIBO with crew and International Partners since Increment 17 and
we have recently acquired new lessons learned regarding possible correlation between crew motion
and g-jitter during crew sleeping time. These finding are expected to be utilized to reduce g-jitter
ISS/KIBO crew sleeping time.

2. New JAXA payload racks
2. I. Kobairo rack overview
KOBAIRO rack consists of Gradient Heating Furnace (GHF) and rack outfitting. The GHF is a
vacuum furnace that contains three heating blocks for one sample cartridge. Their positions and
temperatures can be independently controlled, and various temperature proﬁles in the direction of
sample cartridge aXis can be realized. This facility will be mainly used for high quality crystal growth
experiments using unidirectional solidification. GHF has an automatic sample exchange system that
can be accommodate up to 15 samples to reduce crew operation. The three independent heating zones
can realize various temperature proﬁles to meet with variety of experiments from researchers. Various
experiments can be realized with high temperature (MaX.1600 deg. C) and highly stable temperature
accuracy. Experiments can be performed continuously by installing 15 sample cartridges (Max) in
Sample Cartridge Automatic Exchange Mechanism. Speciﬁcation and outlook of KOBAIRO rack is
shown in table 2.1-1. and figure 2.1-1. [1].

3. Continuous effort for microgravity environment in KIBO
3. I . Background and past microgravity measurement in KIBO
3.1.1. Marangoni experiment overview. Marangoni convection is a surface—tension—driven ﬂow. A
liquid bridge of silicone oil is formed into a pair of disks in Fluid Physics Experiment Facility
Experiment Cell (FPEF-EC) [2]. The liquid bridge is very sensitive to g-jitter because it is not
contained and is sustained by the only surface tension between supporting disks [3]. Therefore, this
experiment is performed during crew sleeping period (21 :30 - 06:00) when g-jitter is expected to
become slightly calm.
3. I .2. Past microgravity measurement results summary Since increment I 7
a) Increment I 7
The ﬁrst Marangoni Experiment was performed in KIBO. The experiment was going well part
of the way, but at the final phase of the experiment series, liquid bridge breakup occurred for
the ﬁrst time. After analyzing the microgravity data, it was found some g-jitter was generated
at the timing of liquid bridge breakup during crew sleeping time. And also the analysis showed
that the taller liquid bridge tends to Vibrate more greatly and that strong g-jitter might have the
possibility of causing the liquid bridge breakup [4] [5]. Even though the disturbance is occurred
in other modules than in KIBO, it may affect Marangoni Experiment from g-jitter perspective.
1)) Increment I 9/20
The number of crewmembers in the 188 has been increased from 3-pers0n operations to 6-
person operations since May, 2009. In order to provide a crew sleeping location pro tempore in

preparation for 6-crew person operations start in 188, the crew quarters equipment needed to be
temporarily installed in KIBO. We coordinated this issue with NASA operations team and
agreed to measure micro G data for all possible crew sleeping conﬁgurations in KIBO. F inally,
the analysis result showed that crew quarters configuration did not affect Marangoni
experiment and g-jitter with crew sleeping in KIBO was lower than 188 microgravity
acceleration performance (S SP41000) [6].
C) Increment 23/24
We performed some series of Marangoni experiment continuously and still observed long
liquid bridge Vibrating largely sometimes. At the expedition crew debrieﬁng, the crewmembers
advised us to call-up a heads-up message to all crewmembers at the evening Daily Flaming
Conference (E-DPC) just before we perform long liquid bridge experiment at night.
0’) Increment 25/26
Per crew advice, we identified the special nights which we needed the most quiescent micro-g
environment for long length liquid bridge experiments with 50 or 60 mm tall 0f 50 mm
diameter. Then we have started to call up a heads-up message to crew at E-DPC just before we
perform long liquid bridge experiment. It was very effective to obtain cooperation from all of
the crew including Russian cosmonauts. G-jitter level was definitely reduced compared to
previous increments because crews might pay attentions when they moved around during
Marangoni experiment with taller liquid bridge.
3.2. Microgravity measurement during crew activity time in KIBO
3.2. 1. During Increment 25, we measured microgravity data in KIBO during crew working time with
KIBO internal camera view and by using MMA (Microgravity Measurement Apparatus) in order to
investigate thefollowing correlation between crew motion and g—jitter.
a) What kind of crew motion may generate critical disturbance to our experiment?
b) How much g-jitter will be generated by crew motion?
By analyzing the microgravity data and KIBO internal camera View, we are expecting to reduce g-
jitter which is generated by crew motion in future experiment.
3.2.2. Microgravity measurement condition is asfollows. MMA consists of TAA (Tri-AXial
Accelerometer), RSU (Remote Sensor Unit), NCU (Network Control Unit) and MLT (MMA Laptop
Terminal). Measurement parameter is shown in table 3.2.2-1.
Table 3.2.2-1. MicrograVity data measurement parameters
(RSU and TAA) TAA ID: 3005
3.2.3. Analysis results are shown in T able 323-]. This table shows the summary for the correlation
between g-jitter over 50 HG and crew motion. 50 HG is approximately equivalent to 188 standard
microgravity requirement. Each aXis for micro-G data is related to KIBO direction as follows. X aXis
(Overhead-Deck), Y aXis (Starboard—Port) and Z aXis (F orward-Aft). Refer to ﬁgure 3.2.3-1.

3.2. 4. Based on the analysis result, thefollowing lessons learned are acquired.

a) When crew moves grasping the overhead handrails, g-jitter over 100 HG often occurs.

b) When crew touches the rack at deck side by hand or by foot, strong g-jitter does not seem occurred.
But When crew moves from overhead to deck side and then touches the deck side, or When crew
kicks the rack at the deck side to move, g-jitter over 100 HG is generated, especially in X axis.

c) When crew was working in the vicinity of Airlock, strong g-jitter was not observed.
01) When crew used the voice loop to communicate ground team, g-jitter was not observed.
e) Even though crew sometimes used a laptop terminal at A7, g-jitter was not observed at that time.
f) When crew stowed/unstowed something to/from Cargo Transfer Bag (CTB), some g-jitter
occurred. But operations in the J LP did not generate g-jitter.
3.3. Waste and Hygiene Compartment (WHC) usage and gjitter
In addition to micro-G data measurement in crew day time, we also measured micro-G data in crew
sleep time during Marangoni experiment. To monitor liquid bridge motion real-timely during
experiment, we observed downlinked image of liquid bridge Via Image Processing Unit (IPU).
Measurement parameter is shown in table 3.3-1.

We still observed liquid bridge was Vibrating so much unexpectedly for several times during
experiment, especially when we performed long liquid bridge experiment. The next day after we
observed some big disturbances to liquid bridge during crew sleeping, we confirmed with crew and
NASA/Houston Flight Control Team (HFCT) whether they had something which rang a bell 0n
midnight g-jitter.

According to crew answer and HFCT’s confirmation on the related telemetries, we found that some
crew motion related to the Waste Hygiene Compartment (WHC) may generate g-jitter which may
impact on Marangoni Experiment. (See figure 3.3-1.)

By imposing WHC current telemetry 0n the micro-G data at the time when we observed big
disturbances, the following features were inferred. (See ﬁgure 3.3-2. and ﬁgure 3.3-3.)

1) Big g-jitter occurred just before/after WHC usage. In case of figure 3.3-2 and ﬁgure 3.3-3,
the Vibration level was about $20 uG (from 0.1 Hz through 0.5 Hz) in Y and Z aXis. This value is
almost equivalent to the ISS microgravity acceleration performance (S SP41000), however, it is larger
than usual during crew sleeping timeframe. It means WHC itself is not the direct Vibration source, but

crew moving or door opening/closing may generate some g-jitter which may cause big Vibration on
the liquid bridge. (Vibration continuous duration was about 30 seconds for each just before/after WHC
usage.)

2) By analyzing crew motion with downlinked KIBO internal camera Video, crew movement
velocity is thought to be about 8/7 [m/s]. Per this velocity, crew can move 34.3 [m] in 30 seconds, for
example, from Service Module to Node 3.

3) The similar features were confirmed in other timings when big g-jitter occurred. The g-jitter
level was almost $20 uG in all cases.

Figure 3.3-2. This ﬁgure shows correlation between big disturbances and WHC current telemetry
(GMT300-301). When WHC current value increased, low frequency (less than 0.7 Hz) g-jitter was
also increased. For example, typical g-jitter related to WHC usage (from GMT 301/0z4l — 1:07) is
shown in Figure 3.3-3.

Figure 3.3-3. This ﬁgure shows MMA data and WHC current data on GMT301. Just before/after
WHC usage timing, g-jitter occurred. It means that WHC is not the direct Vibration source but some
crew motion related to WHC may generate g-jitter. The Vibration level was almost $20 uG (from
0.1 Hz through 0.5 Hz) in Y and Z aXis.

Because all crew members have kindly cooperated to be quiet at night when we perform long liquid
bridge experiment, we would like to reduce too much crew constraints during the night based on these
new findings. From the above results, we will ask crew to open/close the WHC door/shutter softly or
to grab the handrails softly, and move quietly and slowly in order to reduce a big g-jitter may be
caused by crew motion related to WHC activities.

3.4. Future workplan

For future work to improve microgravity environment in KIBO, we are planning to conduct more
challenging experiment and microgravity data measurement. For example, in the Increment 29/30, we
will try to perform Marangoni experiment during crew working time in order to assess whether we can
conduct Marangoni experiment during crew working time without liquid bridge breakup or not.
Because we have no plan to use the Experiment Cell in future again which we’ll use in this trial, we do
not need to request any cleanup activity by crew even though liquid bridge breakup would occur.

In addition, we are thinking about the possibility to measure microgravity data with support of
International Partners while the ROBONAUT is operating during crew sleeping time which may
simulate crew motion. We are expecting that microgravity data analysis can be more quantitative since
ROBONAUT can move predetermined forces.

4. Summary and future KIBO payload operations

Microgravity environment in KIBO has been greatly improved over the past year due to advanced
microgravity measurement and analysis, and of course, crew cooperation during sleeping time is
highly appreciated. Moreover, these microgravity measurement and analysis required close
cooperation by both International Partners and crewmembers, and then this cooperation has resulted in
building a good relationship and enhancing the bond among us in order to achieve good science
success in ISS/KIBO as a team.

Through comparing the MMA data and other related data such as onboard internal camera Video
and the WHC telemetry, we are expecting to narrow down the possible causes of g-jitter during crew
sleeping time to crew motion related WHC usage. For example, we’ll ask crew to reduce g-jitter may
be caused by crew motion related to WHC usage such as grabbing the handrails to move or
opening/closing the door/shutter 0f WHC. This request will be applied to reduce g-jitter when we are
planning to conduct Marangoni Experiment in crew day time for trial. We would like to share the
lessons learned we have got through these experiences with crewmember and International Partners to
reduce crew constraints during the special night when we perform long liquid bridge Marangoni
experiment. For the future, we will aim to perform further challenging experiments utilizing good
microgravity environment in lSS/KIBO.
