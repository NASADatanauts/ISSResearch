(0;) Objective of GeoFlow experiment is to study thermally—driven rotating ﬂuids, in order to
E investigate the stability, pattern formation, and transition to turbulence of viscous incom-
; pressible ﬂuids contained between concentric, co-axially rotating spheres. These physical
E mechanisms are important for a large number of astrophysical and geophysical problems
é showing ﬂows in spherical geometry driven by rotation and convection: for example, to
(L3 explain the mantle convection 0f the Earth, or the ﬂow in a planet’s interior.
E The European microgravity experiment GeoFlow, which is executed in the Fluid Science
2 Laboratory (FSL) of Columbus module on the International Space Station (ISS), is an
8 experiment investigating pattern formation and stability of thermal convection in rotating
E spherical shells under the inﬂuence of an artiﬁcial central symmetric buoyancy ﬁeld and
TC eliminated gravity.
E In this paper we present numerical preliminary studies of this spherical Rayleigh-Bnard
5» problem under a central dielectrophoretic force in microgravity environment and ﬁrst ex-
§ perimental results from ISS. Numerical simulations are done for a range of parameter
Q values for Rayleigh and Taylor number. For the experiment ﬂow Visualization is realised
5 using the Wollaston-shearing method.

E The microgravity experiment GeOFlOW is an European project, integrated in the Fluid Science Laboratory
Q (FSL) in Columbus module of International Space Station (188). This experiment targets on the investigation
of stability and pattern formation of thermal convection in a rotating spherical gap With an artiﬁcial central
dielectrophoretic force ﬁeld by applying an alternating high voltage ﬁeld on the inner spherek3 .

Focusing on main acting forces for example in the inner Earth, that is temperature gradients and rotation,
and neglecting magnetic effects in order to stress thermal and rotating aspects of the theoretical formulation
and experimental setup, that corresponds to research on stability and pattern formation of thermal convection
in a rotating spherical gap. If such phenomena are studied experimentally in an Earth lab, gravity acts axial
to a spherical model, and not central, like in the Earth’s core. Such a central force ﬁeld can be setup using
the dielectrophoretic effect by applying a high voltage alternating ﬁeld on the inner sphere Which is than
acting as a spherical capacitor. Resulting artiﬁcial central acceleration equals approximately 10—2m/32,
showing that acceleration due to gravity With g 2 10m / 32 Will always be dominant in an Earth laboratory.
Needed microgravity conditions for research due to thermal experiments especially requiring long—term ones
are available at the International Space Station (188).

"3","A model of a spherical gap ﬁow experiment should help to understand such phenomena as the zonal
bands of Jupiter, the origin of extremely high winds in the tropics and subtropies of Jupiter, Saturn and
Neptune, the persistent differential rotation of the Sun, the complex patterns of convection in the slowly-
rotating mantle of the Earth, and the rapidly rotating ﬂows in the Earth’s outer liquid core. In ﬁgure 1 a
schematic cross section of the Earth is depicted. The convective motions of the liquid iron alloy in the outer

plementary parameter variations as well as analysis of both — stable and time—dependent — ﬂows that was
found to eXist in the parameter range of the GeoFlow experiment.

As optical measurement method Wollaston—shearing interferometry is used to determine the temperature
ﬁelds and corresponding ﬂow pattern.

Here we present numerical preliminary studies which focus on dynamics of non—rotational and rotational
regimes. For the non—rotational case an approach combining numerical simulations with a spectral time—
stepping code and path—following techniques allows the computation of both stable and unstable solution
branches of stationary states. The transition from the stationary t0 the time—dependent regime is described.
Direct numerical simulation of rotational regimes show bifurcations from basic Via periodic and quasi—periodie
state into Chaos. In the low rotation regime drift of time—dependent solutions is prograde while in the higher
rotation regime drift is retrograde with rotation of the sphere.

Finally, we compare numerical predictions of different thermal ﬂow states with ﬁrst experimental data
from 188 experiment. By comparing numerical and experimental results, it should be possible to determine

0 the dynamics of the observed ﬂow patterns.

For the ﬁrst GeOFlOW on—orbit operations investigation of the ﬂow ﬁeld is performed using Wollaston—Shearing
Interferometry (WSI). Schlieren technique and Shadowgraphy are implemented Within FSL as well. Due to
experiment constraints measurement techniques are used in reﬂective mode. The inner sphere of the setup
is prepared to act as a mirror. Figure 5 (a) shows a sketch of the WSI setup at BTU laboratory used for
preparatory experimental works. Because of the acceleration due to gravity the operation mode is parallel
to the axis of the gravitational force 9 on Earth.
The Adaption Optics (AO) includes an optical lens tool Which converts the planar waves emitted by
the Laser (Q) into spherical waves and the reﬂected waves Vice versa. This is needed due to the spherical

Further input values for the calculations come along With experimental constraints. Working ﬁuid ﬁlling
the spherical gap is a silicone oil of GE Bayer Silicones having a Prandtl number P7“ = 64.64. With inner
radius 7"".- = 27 mm and outer radius r0 = 54 mm the ratio of radii is 77 = 0.5. Experimental runs are to be
performed by applying a constant voltage Wms = 10 kV and varying AT up to 10 K resulting in a Rayleigh
number up to Racentml g 1.4 . 105. Maximum rotation rate up to 2 H 27 corresponds to a Taylor number
value of Tam” = 1.3 ' 107.

g Increasing Rayleigh number corresponds to intensifying thermal impulse to the system. Transition from basic
Li state to steady and then direct to irregular time—dependent convective states are found (Fig. 8). Patterns of
E steady state convection depend on initial state. Increasing Rayleigh number stepwise leads to axisymmetric
states (Fig. 9 (a)—(b)), setting thermal impulse immediately from zero reveals more complex symmetries
(Fig. 9 (c)—(d)). With methods of path following analysis the stability of patterns are validated in different
regimes. For experimental work on 188 different patterns Will be observable due to different runs by Changing
the initial states. Refer to Futterer et al.22 and Bergemethh27 for more details on stability discussions. For
irregular ﬂow tetrahedral patterns dominate ﬂow structures.
2. Rotating Case
From low to intermediate to high rotation the experiment traverses stability lines belonging to most of the
unstable modes (Fig. 8). The higher the rotation the higher the azimuthal mode of convective ﬂow (Fig. 10).
Furthermore a Change of drift velocity occurs that was already predicted by stability analysis of Travnikov.28
Direct numerical simulation results show prograde drift for 10W rotation regime and retrograde drift for
intermediate rotation regime. For low rotation patterns are just rotated but not distorted. For intermediate

For a lOW—rotation case at low Ra number, ﬁg. 13 (a) an axisymmetric ﬂow can be observed. Increasing
Ra number, i.e. temperature difference, see ﬁg. 13 (b), a more complicated ﬂow pattern appears. A special
symmetry can not recognised just from the interferograrns, however, aXial symmetry seems to be broken
deﬁnitely.
Increasing Ta number While keeping constant Ra number, gives rise to an even more complex ﬂow pattern,
With increased inﬂuence of rotation rather than convection due to temperature gradient. However, these ﬁrst
images still have to be analysed in more detail and are intended only as demonstration of feasibility and
quality of the ﬁrst images from GeoFlOW.

"14","VI. Outlook
For further experimental data analysis the Challenge is to implement image processing procedure for
complex ﬂow structures, concerning the the formation and position of the fringes. Additionally, the design
of pattern recognition is necessary for an effective comparison and sorting of many images and other exper—
imental data under speciﬁc criteria.
While the ﬁrst GeoFlow campaign is running now until J uly 2009, a re—ﬂight campaign is under discussion
already (GeoFlow II). For this re—ﬂight a ﬂuid With strongly temperature—dependent Viscosity Will be used
to form a model for Earth mantle convection. The methods of scientiﬁc analysis Will be comparable to that
for GeoFlow I, but the convective behaviour is expected to be quite different compared to GeoFlow 1.
