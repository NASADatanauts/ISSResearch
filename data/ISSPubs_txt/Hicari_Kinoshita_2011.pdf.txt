Abstract. Homogeneous SiGe crystal growth experiments Will be performed on board the ISS
""Kibo"" using a gradient heating ﬁarnace (GHF). A new crystal growth method invented for
growing homogeneous mixed crystals named ""travelling liquidus-zone (TLZ) method"" is
evaluated by the growth of Si0,5Geo,5 crystals in space. We have already succeeded in growing
homogeneous 2mm diameter Si0,5Geo,5 crystals on the ground but large diameter homogeneous
crystals are difﬁcult to be grown due to convection in a melt. In microgravity, larger diameter
crystals can be grown With suppressing convection. Radial concentration proﬁles as well as
axial proﬁles in microgravity grown crystals Will be measured and Will be compared With our
tWO-dimensional TLZ growth model equation and compositional variation is analyzed. Results
are beneﬁcial for growing large diameter mixed crystals by the TLZ method on the ground.
Here, we report on the principle of the TLZ method for homogeneous crystal growth, results of
preparatory experiments on the ground and plan for microgravity experiments.
1. Introduction
Growth of homogeneous mixed bulk crystals has been investigated by many researchers and variety of
zone melting methods have been invented [1-4]. Among them, the travelling liquidus-zone (TLZ)
method is the most promising method for growing homogeneous mixed bulk crystals [4-6]. Validity of
the method has been proved by the growth of InGaAs platy crystals and 2mm diameter SiGe crystals
on the ground by conﬁning melts in thin layers or capillary tubes for suppressing convection [4-11].
However, large diameter cylindrical crystals are difﬁcult to be grown on the ground due to convection
in melts. We plan crystal growth experiments by the TLZ method in microgravity for proving
usefulness of the TLZ method by the growth of larger diameter crystals; 10mm diameter SiojGer
cylindrical crystals Will be grown and radial compositional homogeneity as well as axial one Will be
evaluated. In evaluation, measured compositional proﬁles Will be compared With our tWO-dimensional
TLZ growth model equation and conditions for growing large diameter homogeneous mixed crystals
Will be established.

Here, we report on the principle of the TLZ method for homogeneous crystal growth, results of
preparatory experiments on the ground and plan for microgravity experiments.
2. TLZ method
The TLZ method is a kind of zone melting method but is different from conventional zone melting
method in forming a liquidus-zone in Which solute is almost saturated. Such liquidus-zone is possible
When temperature gradient is low, zone Width is narrow and low melting temperature material is rich
in the zone. Sample conﬁguration, concentration proﬁle in the sample and its relation to the phase
diagram is shown in Figure 1 in the ease of Si05Ge05 crystal growth.

Ge concentration proﬁle as shown in Figure 1 is obtained by heating a sample in Which Ge is
sandwiched by a Si seed and a Si feed at around 1100°C and at a temperature gradient of about
10°C/cm. At the freezing interface, a melt coexists With a grown crystal and therefore Si concentration
is saturated. At the dissolving interface, the melt coexists With a solid feed and Si concentration is
saturated, too. If temperature gradient is low and melt zone Width is narrow, Si concentration in the
melt is almost saturated in the Whole as shown in Figure 1. Then, we named such a solute saturated
melt zone as a liquidus-zone.

Crystal growth occurs spontaneously due to inter diffusion of Si and Ge because Ge and Si
concentration difference is formed in the liquidus-zone. When Ge is transported away from the
freezing interface, Si becomes richer than its equilibrium concentration at the corresponding
temperature and crystal growth proceeds. At the crystal growth, Ge is segregated and the segregated
Ge is transported to the dissolving interface (opposite side of the freezing interface). At the dissolving
interface, Ge concentration increases due to transported Ge and its concentration exceeds equilibrium
concentration and excess Ge dissolves a solid Si feed and the dissolving interface becomes equilibrium
again. By the continuation of this process, crystal growth proceeds spontaneously.

We estimated crystal growth rate as described in the references [6, 9, 11]. The obtained equation is
as follows.

Here, R is freezing rate, CLO and C50 are liquidus and solidus concentrations at the freezing interface,
D is interdiffusion coefﬁcient between solute and solvent. Since solute is saturated, (6CL /8Z)Z=0 is
expressed by the reciprocal of the slope of the liquidus line (8CL MT) multiplied by temperature

gradient (8T/8Z). Very important point in equation (1) is that freezing rate R is controlled by
temperature gradient. Then it is very easy to translate a sample device synehronizingly in the opposite
direction to the freezing rate and to keep freezing interface temperature constant. Relation between R
and (0T/0Z) in equation (1) was conﬁrmed by measuring temperature gradient in a melt and growth
rate R, and by comparing the measured growth rate with the calculated one [6].
3. Experimental procedures
A Ge zone forming material was sandwiched by a Si seed and a Si feed and was inserted into a boron
nitride crucible. The crucible was vacuum sealed by a quartz ampoule. This sample device was heated
in a temperature gradient furnace. Sample conﬁguration and its relation to temperature proﬁle in the
furnace is shown in Figure 2. Growth experiments were performed on the ground using a laboratory
furnace or a ground model furnace. According to equation (1), temperature gradient of 7°C/em in a
melt gives growth rate of 0.1 mm/h for the composition Si05Ge05. Therefore, temperature gradients
between 7 and 14°C/em were selected for Si05Ge05 growth experiments. Crystals with 2mm diameter
and 10mm diameter were grown for elucidating effects of convection in melts. In 2mm diameter
crystals, convection in melts is suppressed due to small bores 0f crucibles while convection in melts
will occur in 10mm diameter crystal growth on the ground.

4. Results and discussion

4.]. Conﬁrmation offhe T [Z growth model

Since the TLZ growth requires diffusion-eontrolled mass transport, principle of the TLZ method is

studied by the growth of 2mm diameter crystals with suppressing convection in melts [6, 9]. Figure 3

shows an example of aXial concentration proﬁles for a TLZ-grown 2mm diameter crystal. A 13mm

long eompositionally uniform Si0.49Ge0.51 crystal was obtained. In the ﬁgure, Ge concentration proﬁle

of a Bridgman-grown crystal is depicted for comparison. No homogeneous part is observed in a

Bridgman-grown crystal. Superiority of the TLZ method in eompositionally uniform mixed crystal

growth is clear. In the growth, measured temperature gradient was 8°C and sample translation rate was

0.11mn1/h. This result agrees well with equation (1) if we use Si-Ge inter diffusion rate 9.5 X 10—8 mz/s

which is estimated by Adaehi et al. [9].

4.2. Large diameter crystal growth

Since we succeeded in growing eompositionally uniform small diameter Si05Ge05 crystals by the TLZ

method, we tried 10mm diameter crystal growth. It was shown that radial compositional

inhomogeneity increased as crystal growth proceeded. Figure 4 shows a result of two dimensional Ge

concentration analysis. Freezing interface can clearly be seen beoause Ge concentration in the crystal
is different from that in the liquidus zone. It can be said that the freezing interface is concave towards

the liquidus zone. Seed/orystal interface (the initial freezing interface) is almost ﬂat but radius of
curvature of the freezing interface is about 20mm at the growth length of about 10mm. Therefore, the
interface curvature degrades radial compositional uniformity. Figure 5 shows radial Ge concentration
proﬁle near the freezing interface Which is about 10mm away from the initial interface. About 1 at%

4.3 T wo-dimensional model
As described above, When crystal diameter is increased, radial composition degrades and two-
dimensionality should be considered. We therefore proposed a two-dimensional TLZ growth model
[12]. In the model, radial temperature gradient term is added to the equation (1), and we obtain
equation (2).

We want to compare freezing interface position of large diameter Si05Ge05 crystals With our two
dimensional growth model but interface shapes are not always reproductive for terrestrially grown
crystals. A variety of interface shape were observed . In Figure 6 two examples of interface shapes are
shown. Regular interface shape as shown in ﬁgure 4 is very rare and irregular interface shapes as

shown in ﬁgure 6 are often observed. Origin of such irregularity may be caused by convection in a
melt beoause density difference between Si and Ge is considerable; density of Si in a liquid phase is
about 2.5 whereas density of Ge is about 5.6 at 990°C. Thus, two-dimensional growth model equation
cannot be applied to terrestrially grown crystals. One aim of our space experiments is to obtain
interface curvature dependence on growth rate (on temperature gradient) and on growth length without
convection in a melt and compare interface curvature with our two-dimensional model. If we succeed
in quantitative evaluation of equation (2), we can calculate effect of radial temperature gradient on
radial compositional proﬁle and we can estimate oritioal radial temperature gradient for establishing
compositional uniformity in the radial direction. Such estimation will be useful for growing large
homogeneous crystals by the TLZ method.

4.4 Preparatory experiments on the ground
Since heater length of the GHF is shorter than the usual laboratory furnace, maintaining a constant
temperature gradient is difﬁcult. Therefore, growth conditions which were obtained using laboratory
furnace cannot be directly applied to a ﬂight model of the GHF. We investigated growth conditions for
a ﬂight model of the GHF using a ground model of the GHF. At ﬁrst, temperature proﬁles were
measured using a dummy sample which is composed of solid Si as a seed, solid boron nitride as a zone
and solid Si as a feed. By the translation of heater zones, temperature proﬁles were changed. Therefore,
we changed heating conditions so that the temperature proﬁle is not varied by the translation of heater
zone. In the second step, we grew SiGe crystals by the TLZ method. In the ﬁrst run, initial
composition and temperature gradient were deviated from the expected values as shown in Figure 7.
However, adjustment of heating conditions are easy because composition reﬂeots interface
temperature and growth rate reﬂeots temperature gradient in the TLZ method. After several
experiments, we obtained appropriate growth conditions for the ﬂight model furnace. Figure 8 shows
one example of adjusted compositional proﬁles obtained on the ground. It is shown that Si and Ge
concentrations are 50i 1 at% in a grown crystal for the length of more than 15mm.

5. Plan for microgravity experiments
We are planning to obtain reproducible interface curvatures in the absence of convective ﬂow in a
melt and we Will compare two dimensional TLZ growth model equation With experimentally obtained
interface curvatures. Data obtained by microgravity experiments are used to obtain large sized
homogeneous Si1_XGeX crystals Which are useful as substrates of high speed CMOS devices. The GHF
furnace for crystal growth experiments has already been on board the ISS “Kibo” and is being checked
on its feasibility. After checking out, growth experiments Will be performed.
6. Summary
A new crystal growth method named the TLZ method has been invented for growing homogeneous
mixed crystals. Axial compositional homogeneity has been evaluated by the growth of small diameter
crystals on the ground because convection in a melt is suppressed. However, evaluation of radial
compositional homogeneity in large diameter crystals is not so easy because convection causes local
compositional inhomogeneity on the ground. Therefore, microgravity experiments are planned for
controlling radial compositional inhomogeneity and for evaluating a two dimensional TLZ growth
model. Some results of preparatory experiments on the ground and plan for space experiments are
described.
