:gcgcigdezrozggfober 2009 radiation in different compartments of the International Space Station (155) using passive detectors.

p Luminescent detectors (LD) and CR—39 plastic nuclear track detectors (PNTD) were exposed onboard of
H— Russian Service Module on 155 from August 2004 to October 2005 (425 days); they were placed at SPD
Seywor 5'. boxes and positioned at 6 various locations inside the Russian Service Module. LD were used to measure

pace d051metry . .

International Space Station absorbed closes, part1cularly from low—LET part1cles and photons, PNTDs were used to rneasure the
passive detector spectra of 11near energy transfer (LET), absorbed dose, and close equ1valents from part1cles w1th LETool-IZO
Track etch detector >5 keV/um. Results from both types of detectors (LD and PNTD) were then combined together to obtain
total values of absorbed closes and close equivalents. Distribution of absorbed closes and close equivalents
measured with passive detectors, as well as LET spectra of registered particle ﬂuxes, are presented as the
function of position of SPD boxes (shielding thickness). Also the inﬂuence of position of detectors inside
the SPD boxes (top and bottom wall) will be discussed. The close characteristics depend on the location

inside the Service Module; their variation has been observed to be up to factor of almost 2.
