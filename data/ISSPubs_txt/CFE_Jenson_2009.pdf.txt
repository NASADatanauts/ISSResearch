This paper highlights the experimental, analytical, and numerical results of the Capil-
lary Flow Experiment (CFE) performed aboard the International Space Station (188). The
experiments were conducted in space beginning with Increment 9 through Increment 16,
beginning August, 2004 and ending December, 2007. Both ‘primary’ and ‘extra science’
experiments were conducted during 19 operations performed by 7 astronauts including:
M. Fincke, W. McArthur, J. Williams, S. Williams, M. Lopez-Alegria, C. Anderson, and
P. Whitson. CFE consists of 6 approximately 1 t0 2kg handheld experiment units designed
to investigate a selection of capillary phenomena of fundamental and applied importance,
such as large length scale contact line dynamics (CFE-Contact Line), critical wetting in
discontinuous structures (CFE-Vane Gap), and capillary ﬂows and passive phase separa-
tions in complex containers (CFE-Interior Corner Flow). Highly quantitative video from
the simply performed ﬂight experiments provide data helpful in benchmarking numerical
methods, conﬁrming theoretical models, and guiding new model development. A brief his-
tory of the experiment is provided before introducing the science investigated. A selection
of experimental results and comparisons with both analytic and numerical predictions is
given. Despite the simple nature of the experiments and procedures, many of the experi-
mental results may be practically employed to enhance the design of spacecraft engineering
systems involving capillary interface dynamics.

I. Introduction

Following the Space Shuttle Columbia accident, developments in NASA’S shuttle program allowed new
opportunities for science experiments aboard 188. Since the shuttle was temporarily unable to ferry planned
science equipment to 188, NASA sought substitute candidate experiments to take advantage of any possible
available crew time. The design constraints for such experiments are stringent and include: safe operation,
low mass < 2.5kg, low volume < 2 liters, minimal electrical interfacing, minimal power requirements, minimal
to no crew training required, short hardware delivery schedule (i.e. months), and low cost. This list is not
exhaustive, but is certainly restrictive, and stems from NASA’S desire to use in part the Russian Progress
vehicle to deliver science experiment hardware to ISS—the available cargo weight and volume for science
hardware aboard Progress being limited. Fortunately, a Class of ﬂuids experiments can be posed that ﬁt this
description, and the Capillary Flow Experiment (CFE) was proposed to NASA and competed 0n the basis
of science and strategic research merit. The experiments address questions of both scientiﬁc and engineering
importance and concern certain capillary phenomena as it relates to large length scale ﬂuid systems that
commonly arise aboard spacecraft, but not in terrestrial laboratories.

CFE is composed of six vessels including three experiment pairs—Contact Line (CL), Vane Gap (VG),
and Interior Corner Flow (ICF), performed essentially in this order. All vessels use similar ﬂuid injection
hardware, have similarly sized test Chambers, and rely solely on Video for quantitative data. The general
engineering design characteristics common to the CFE vessels include: (1) mass < 2kg, (2) volume < 2.1L,

crew training needed, (6) low toxicity ﬂuids (i.e. Silicone oils) and (7) double seals against ﬂuid leak. The
objective of the different CFE vessels are summarized as follows:

0 The Contact Line (CL) experiments are highlighted in Section 111. These experiments required the
most extensive data reduction effort in CFE and a database was established to catagorize the greater
than 350 tests performed. The primary objective of the CL experiments is to investigate the effect of
contact line boundary conditions on dynamic interface response following a variety of perturbations.
Both pinned— and smooth—wall conditions for both perfect and partial wetting conditions are studied
in hopes of bracketing all possible responses between the two extremes of ﬁxed and free contact line
boundary conditions. Experimental and numerical results are presented along With extra science events
depicting phenomena not part of the primary objectives.

0 The Vane Cap (VG) experiments are reviewed in Section IV and concern gap—wetting in a cylinder
With elliptic cross—section. When rotated, an asymmetric vane oriented along the axis of the chamber
achieves a variety of critical geometries leading to nearly discontinuous wetting and de—wetting of
gaps formed between the vane and the container wall. The critical wetting conditions are compared
to theoretical and numerical predictions and may be exploited for the purposes of controlling large
quantities of liquids in reduced gravity environments. Both static and dynamic interfaces are studied.

0 The Interior Corner Flow (ICF) experiments are outlined brieﬂy in Section V and address passive
capillary—driven corner ﬂows in weakly 3—dimensiona1 geometries. Experiments demonstrating passive
phase separations are conducted. Comparisons of the heavily geometry—dependent ﬂow With developing
theoretical models are made.

II. Background and Motivation

As has been stated on numerous occasions by numerous investigators, capillary ﬂows and phenomena
are critical to myriad ﬂuids management systems in low—g including: fuels/cryogen storage systems, thermal
control systems (e.g. vapor/liquid separation), life support systems (e.g. water recycling), and materials
processing in the liquid state. Under microgravity conditions, capillary forces can be exploited to control
ﬂuid orientation so that such mission—critical systems perform predictably. CFE is a simple fundamental
scientiﬁc study that can yield quantitative results from a set of safe, handheld ﬂuids experiments. The
experiments aim to provide results of value to the capillary ﬂow community that cannot be easily achieved
in ground—based tests. Speciﬂc applications of the results tend to center on ﬂuids challenges concerning
propellant tanks. However, the knowledge gained may help spacecraft ﬂuid systems designers in general by
increasing conﬁdence in current design tools to predict such large scale capillary phenomena.

A. Hardware and Setup

The handheld experiments are designed to be operated on the Maintenance Work Area (MWA), a portable
workbench in the United States Laboratory of the 188 shown in Figure 1. Set up and operation are simple
and intuitive, requiring minimal preparation. All of the experiments require use of an 188 Video camera and
a diffuse paper screen employed as a backlight. The camera is a standard rate Sony 720x480 CCD DVCam
and is mounted to an ISS rail. Astronauts are allowed freedom in Where and how the camera and experiment
are conﬁgured With the primary requirement that the camera be perpendicular to the test vessel front face.
The CFE vessels are rigidly mounted to the MWA by a setscrew.

III. Contact Line (CL)

The CFE Contact Line experiment consists of two vessels each containing two right circular cylinders,
one smooth and the other With a machined groove serving as a pinning edge. Both cylinders are ﬁlled to
identical levels and since the containers are closely and rigidly connected, any disturbance imparted to the
vessel is felt by both ﬂuid surfaces. Differences in ﬂuid response is thus expected to be solely a result of
differences in contact line boundary condition, Which is readily observed in Figure 2. The simple operation of
CL requires the astronaut to impart a variety of disturbances to the vessel allowing the interface oscillations

to decay naturally in the ﬁeld of View of the camera. Dynamic Bond numbers as low as 10—5 and greater
than 20 are achieved spanning both Visco— and inertial—capillary ﬂow regimes. Video data is collected from
Which both the disturbance input and passive liquid response can be digitized. The brevity (5s—30s) of
each experiment event (disturbance and damped ﬂuid response) permitted a large number of tests to be
conducted, the reduced data set of Which comprises over 350 primary science events not counting numerous
other tests referred to as ‘extra science’ tests.
A. CL Hardware Description
A photograph of the CLZ ﬂight unit is provided in Figure 3 along With a solid model of the design With
key components noted. The two units are identical in all respects save wetting properties, ﬂuid volume,
and pinning lip location. The main body is machined from a single piece of cast acrylic and ﬁtted With
aluminum pistons and stainless steel piston drive screws. The right Circular cylindrical test Chambers have
ﬂat bases but elliptical acrylic lids. Each unit is secured to an aluminum base plate With a single slotted hole
that is used for attachment to the ISS MWA Via a captive fastener allowing for as much as 40mm lateral
motion or adjustment. Turning a knob connected to a drive screw displaces the piston. The knob diameter
and screw pitch are selected so that a slow and stable manual ﬂll process is assured. The double O—ring
sealed reservoirs, Charged at atmospheric pressure (N Patm), contain the silicone oil test liquid and employ
pistons to dispense the liquid into the respective test sections. Thus, the blind test Chambers are somewhat
pressurized (N 1.3Patm) When the liquid is fully deployed. The design meets a single level of containment
requirement for a ‘Zero—hazard’ test liquid enabling the experiments to be performed by any crew member
in the open ISS laboratories.

The CLl unit tests a partially wetting liquid With a nominal contact angle of N 500 While the CLZ unit
tests a perfectly wetting (spreading), zero contact angle liquid. The selection of a 38.1mm cylinder diameter
is constrained by an ISS safety requirement for maximum ﬂuid volume. The cylinder diameter is sized
to be as large as possible Within this constraint to access uniquely IOW—g inertial—capillary regimes Without
introducing overbearing depth effects. The liquid volume and height of the pinning lip are selected such that
the liquid depth from the centerline of the IOW—g menisci t0 the cylinder base is the same for both CL1 and

Certain wetting barriers are applied to the containers to enhance control during the experiment opera—
tions. The surface coating conditions vary between CL1 and CL2. The entire interior surface of CL1 is rinse
coated With FC—724, a transparent ﬂuoro—polymer surface coating manufactured by the 3M Corporation.
CL2 is intended to be a perfectly wetting experiment thus for the Pinning cylinder the interior surfaces
above the pinning lip are coated, including the groove making up the pinning edge. The discontinuous wet—
ting boundary established across the pinning lip in CL2 creates a passive means of returning the ﬂuid from
above the pinning edge to below it Via a favorable wetting discontinuity. The lid of the Smooth cylinder is
also coated. All other surfaces of CL2 are uncoated and exhibit perfect wetting, (9 = 00 . The equilibrium
contact angle for the silicone oil on the FC—724 surface is determined by measuring advancing and receding
contact angles using a tilted FC—724 coated glass capillary tube.1 These values are listed in Table 1. The
equilibrium angle is computed2 to be 48.7 i 20 but is frequently referred to as 500 in reference to CL1.
Contact angle values identiﬁed during the ﬂight experiments conﬁrm these values despite the test unit being
stored for approximately 2 years prior to testing.

"5","B. CL Disturbance Types
A variety of disturbances were imparted by hand to the CL vessels by the astronauts and are brieﬂy described
here.

0 Tap: This disturbance is a single tap imparted to the rigidly mounted container. The disturbance
begins with small taps progressing to light knuckle raps. The ﬂuid response is characterized by small
amplitude high frequency oscillations which can only be marginally resolved.

0 Axial: With the CL vessel rigidly mounted to the MWA, the axial mode disturbance is imparted by
manually depressing and releasing the MWA in a similar manner as a diver on a diving board. The
amplitude (acceleration) of the disturbance is controlled by the crew and a wide range is achievable
from marginally discernable (0.21mm) to well beyond destabilization, and break—up of the interface
(> 13.60mm).

0 Push: The Push disturbance consists of a single lateral translation of the vessel. The set screw
mounting the vessel to the MWA is loosened, allowing the astronaut to push the container left or right
in the ﬁeld of View creating an impulsive slosh—type disturbance. The translation distance begins small
and increases to up to 33mm (spanning linear and nonlinear regimes until breakup of the interface).

0 Slide/Slosh: This extension of the Push disturbance is called Slide or Slosh, and consists of a full
period lateral oscillation. The input frequency is approximately that of the natural frequency of the
interface as identiﬁed by the crew, and is held approximately constant while varying the amplitude.

o Multi—Slide: As the name suggests, the Multi—Slide disturbance is a sequence of Slide/Slosh distur—
bances imparted without pause and composed of more than one period. The frequency of oscillation
is held approximately constant while the displacement amplitude is varied.

o Swirl: To impart the Swirl mode disturbances, the CL vessel is moved in a Circular or elliptical pattern
of approximately 30 to 40 millimeters in diameter in a motion consisting of 1—5 periods on the MWA
surface. Large amplitude swirls create centrifugal force—dominated vortical ﬂows. Such disturbances
were only performed for CL2 and the data has not been reduced to date.

C. CL Flight Operations Summary
CFE CL was performed 6 times aboard 188 by astronauts M. Finoke (2), W. MoArthur (1), J . Williams (2),
and P. Whitson (1) on Expeditions 9, 12, 13, and 16 between August 28th, 2004 and November 16th, 2007.
The highlights of each operation are outlined below:

0 Large amplitude Axial disturbances With destabilization and droplet ejection

0 Due to increased stability of droplets residing in the Pinning lip (due to the larger contact angle),
large accelerations were needed to Clear the Pinning lip. Apparently, such high accelerations could
not be easily generated by hand. During attempts to Clear the Pinning lip, excessive force led to
damage of the CLl hardware resulting in premature termination of the experiment.

D. CL Primary Science Summary

Over 350 primary and extra science events have been reduced to date, Where signiﬁcant contributions include
both experimental results and numerical comparisons. Only a small subset of the data is provided here.
The complete database may be found at http://Cfe.pdx.edu. To date, only damped interface oscillations
(frequency and decay) as functions of ﬂuid properties, wetting, contact line condition, disturbance type, and
amplitude have been pursued. Representative results for Axial and lateral mode passive ﬂuid response is
shown in Figure 4 for CLl (partial wetting) and CL2 (perfect wetting). In each ﬁgure Pinned and Smooth
contact line boundary conditions are compared. There is a Clear difference in damping rate, frequency, and
qualitative waveform depending on the contact line condition.

0 The ‘stiﬂ'er’ pinning condition produces higher frequencies for all disturbance modes.

0 Pinning interfaces generally exhibit lower damping rates than their Smooth cylinder counterparts.

0 Larger contact angles produce higher frequencies and lower damping rates. This is immediately obvious
by comparing CLl and CL2 and gives rise to a CLl natural frequency of approximately 25—fold that
of CL2.

o The most prominent difference between Pinning and Smooth responses is found in the partially wetting
CLl lateral mode case in Figure 4(0). The ﬁrst inertial peak of the Smooth response abruptly decays
between 2 and 4 seconds While its pinned counterpart decays more gradually.

o The damped oscillation proﬁles diverge between Pinning and Smooth cylinders as disturbance ampli—
tudes increase.

0 For the current CL test conditions, ﬂuid depth has only a slight effect on passive interface response—
depth to radius ratios down to 0.26.

E. CL Numerical Comparison
The CL database may be used to benchmark ‘large’ length scale CFD models. As part of such a demonstra—
tion, and in collaboration with J . Klatte and M. Dreyer (of ZARM and the University of Bremen, Germany),
blind numerical predictions were made using the open source OpenFOAM CFD package in an effort to model
the CL experiments. Details of the numerical conﬁguration can be found elsewhere3 with a brief overview
and summary of results presented here.

The numerical model was conﬁgured without knowledge of the experimental results; i.e. r10 hints were
given as to run time, required mesh resolution, or any other numerical input parameters. Only physical
dimensions, ﬂuid properties, wetting conditions, and input accelerations were provided to the numerical
analyst. [Note that the input disturbance acceleration was computed using the input disturbance position
data, smoothed using a Loess method before central differences were computed. The smoothing methods were
varied, but the CFD results were insensitive—coarse and highly smoothed data produced nearly identical
results] Optical distortions were accounted for in both numerical predictions and experimental data.

Comparisons were made for several Push and Axial mode disturbances possessing smooth and pinning
boundary conditions. Example comparisons for Axial and Push modes are presented in Figure 5. In general,
agreement is most favorable for the perfectly wetting condition of CLZ, Figures 5(0) and 5(d). This is in part
due to the highly damped nature of these ﬂows, which naturally reduces the sensitivity of the ﬂow on the
particular boundary condition applied at the contact line—Smooth and Pinning cylinders respond similarly.
Discrepancies arise most noticeably for the partial wetting case of CLl, where despite the poorer agreement
the Pinning cylinder results (Figure 5(b)) fair better than those of the Smooth cylinder (Figure 5(a)). The
increased inaccuracy is primarily due to the Choice of contact line boundary condition, and is readily observed
over the manifold weakly damped oscillations.

Several practical conclusions may be drawn for these oscillation comparisons: (1) The current OpenFOAM
model does surprisingly well to predict the large length scale capillary phenomena for highly wetting systems
with a simple ﬁxed contact angle boundary condition at the contact line. (2) The model may be successfully
tuned Via pre—calculations improving the likelihood of accurate and efﬁcient ‘blind’ computations for design

boundary conditions necessary to specify partial wetting systems With contact angle hysteresis. Spacecraft
ﬂuid systems employing such ﬂuids (i.e. water processing systems) Will likely require parametric studies for
the various conditions that can arise at the contact line represented in their extremes by perfect slip and
perfectly pinned conditions.

F. CL Database Description
The CL database is publicly available at http: //Cfe.pdx.edu With digitized events categorized for subsequent
data reduction and research. Each CL event is accompanied by an MPEG—1 Video and corresponding
datasheet describing physical parameters, tracking methods, raw data, and preliminary results. Datasheets
are designed such that all information is presented in a manner such that one can repeat the data reduction
exactly if desired. A summary page is also provided Where information about each individual datasheet
is presented in a single location along With Video and datasheet links. The intent is to provide pertinent
numerical information spanning all of the data in a single location allowing comparison of various parameters.
An overview of how the database can be used is shown in Figure 6. The primary components of the database
are the summary page, MPEG—1 Video, and the individual datasheets corresponding to each Video or event.
Each datasheet and corresponding Video can be accessed through the summary page. In addition, the
summary page contains select statistics and results obtained from the individual datasheets. The arrows
1—F and 5—F indicate this type of ﬂow Where ‘F’ indicates ‘File Open.’ In addition to simply reading the
data, one can take the original Video, prepare it, and digitize it on ones own terms. This is achieved by
following the procedure between Z—Read, 3—Convert, and 4—Digitize. The original MPEG—1 Video is read
into the freeware program VirtualDub4 and saved as an uncompressed AVI, Which completes the conversion
process. The converted Video can then be digitized using the freeware program Spotlight—S.5 At this point
the datasheets accompanying the Video can be reconstructed by the user. The complete database along With
Video, updates, and current information can be found at http://Cfe.pdx.edu. Custom versions of the data

G. Extra Science
Numerous ‘extra science’ events were also captured on Video and include liquid jetting, droplet impact and
satellite rebound dynamics, air entrainment during Axial disturbances, annular ‘hourglass’ ﬁlm draining,
wetting gradient effects, contact line stability, and more. A selection of these extra events are brieﬂy discussed
here With the expressed purpose of demonstrating the range of phenomena that may be further mined from
the CL experiments.

0 J etting: During CL operations the disturbance amplitudes were increased until surface breakup oc—
curred. If an Axial mode disturbance is large enough, destabilization of the interface occurs resulting in
droplet ejection. If the disturbance is further increased a liquid jet is formed Which eventually breaks
up into a stream of drops. Several parameters affect Whether jetting occurs, including disturbance
amplitude, frequency, and waveform. As amplitudes become large the possibility of ejection increases;
however, it is found that it must be coupled With a sufﬁciently high frequency and appropriate wave—
form. This is evident in Figure 7 Where the ‘below’ event produces no ejection, ‘Critical’ produces a
single stationary droplet, and the ‘above’ event results in jetting. The similarity between disturbances

"10","but very different ﬂuid responses indicates that there is a narrow region in which drop ejection and
jetting occurs. [Note that the critical frequency for CL2 is approximately 2.5GHz or 2.5—fold the nat—
ural frequency. Note also that the velocity waveform for the ‘Critical’ case is nearly symmetric about
the t—aXis, while the ‘above’ (jetting) case has a net positive velocity, and the ‘below’ case has a net
negative velocity]

0 Contact Line Stability: An analogous situation arises when lateral mode disturbances become large
in the Pinning cylinder. In this case the contact line de—pins from the Pinning lip causing it to ﬂood
with liquid as shown in Figure 8. Such destabilization occurs repeatedly during the CL experiments
providing opportunities to establish the critical acceleration environment that leads to depinning of
the contact line.

0 Droplet Impact and Rebound Dynamics: On numerous occasions following interface breakup,
the astronauts would subject the vessel to very large aXial mode disturbances before resetting the
experiment. The intent was to produce jetting and a stream of droplets that would then bounce, slide,
and roll about the Chamber eventually adhering to dry walls or coalescing with liquid ﬁlms or bulk
interfaces. Several such images are displayed in Figure 9. It was found that if a droplet is greater than
a certain size, when impacting and adhering to a dry wall of partial wettability a satellite droplet is
ejected. The process repeats until the ejected droplet is small to the point Viscous forces prevent further
ejection. Several such events are provided in the CL database with only a handful being analyzed6 to
date.

0 Contact Angle Variation: During the CLl experiments anomalous wetting was observed in the
Smooth cylinder. Various static interfaces are shown in Figure 10 as a function of ﬂuid depth. The
local essentially aXial wetting variations, caused either by a poorly applied coating or by a locally crazed
surface (observed in the ﬂight hardware), led inadvertently to new science since an array of contact
angles could be tested in a single cylinder by varying liquid depth. Contact angles were backsolved
using the equilibrium surface curvature.

amplitude disturbances in the perfectly wetting Smooth cylinder only. An example may be observed
in the ﬁrst frame of Figure 9, Smooth cylinder. The conﬁguration was a nuisance for the primary
objectives and was frequently erased using the centrifuge methods, but data on the rate of its formation
to a variety of input disturbances, its dimensions, its passive recovery to the desired equilibrium
state, and its drainage under noticeable background accelerations was recorded and is available for
further investigation. Such conﬁgurations are of practical interest because they readily form in highly
wetting systems subject to various disturbances and time—dependent acceleration ﬁelds not uncommon
to spacecraft fuel tanks. They are also of interest in that they contribute to axial pumping of the
ﬂuid in response to lateral excitations, a phenomena of which might be exploited 0r of concern to any
number of applications. This non—equilibrium conﬁguration is addressed in greater, but still superﬁcial,
detail elsewhere.6’7
These extra science examples demonstrate the range of phenomena occurring during the CL operations as a
byproduct of the primary science investigation. All cases of such ‘extra science’ events were not investigated
exhaustively, but a number of the events are noted in the database and provide potential science opportunities
for interested parties. Additional extra science data includes bubble entrainment due to Axial disturbances,
entrained bubble coalescence, annular ﬁlm draining, droplet—wall coalescence, droplet ﬁlm rebound, swirl
mode disturbances, and probably others. Original Video can be found at http://Cfe.de.edu.
IV. Vane Gap (VG)
It is well known that careful selection of geometry has the potential to control large amounts of ﬂuid in
a reduced gravity environment. Containers with interior corners are one such Choice as the corner tends to
act as a capillary conduit driving spontaneous ﬂows along its length. It is essential in such systems that the
ﬂuid ‘wets’ the corner which can be determined from the Concus—Firm critical corner wetting (:01r1diti01r1.8’9
Unfortunately, this condition is signiﬁcantly complicated for interior corners that do not actually contact;
such as in the gap formed by a vane and tank wall of a large propellant storage tank. Intended 0r unintended
positional Changes of such vanes can have a dramatic impact on the ﬂuid conﬁguration. Two CFE VG test
vessels are devoted to investigate such phenomenon using a right cylinder with an elliptic cross—section and
a single and rotatable central vane that does not contact the container walls as shown in Figure 11. Critical
vane gap wetting, dewetting, and an asymmetric bulk ﬂuid shift occur in such containers as a function of
vane angle.
A. Hardware Description
The two VG vessels are identical in every aspect except wetting characteristics and vane dimensions. VGl
is perfectly wetting (6’ = 00), while VGZ is partially wetting (6’ 2 480). The major and minor diameters
of the cylindrical ellipse are 5.08(:m and 3.378(2m, respectively. The internal height of the ﬂuid Chamber is
12.7cm measured from the base to the lid. A volume of 49.106 of 100s red—dyed Silicone oil is used in both
vessels where the ﬂuid depth is 3.81cm assuming a ﬂat surface. The central vanes in both VGl and VGZ
are rectangular with dimensions 3.134cm by 11.430m, and vane thicknesses 0.20(:m and 0.500m, respectively.
The vane pivot aXis is coaxial with the ellipse but gap dimensions are 0.0838(2m and 0.167cm when the vane
is aligned with the minor diameter as shown in Figure 11. These gap dimensions represent a 0.95 and 0.90
dimensionless gap using the minor aXis radius for normalization. Thus two ‘gaps’ can be tested for each vane

crew rotates the vane at prescribed increments allowing signiﬁcant time (up to 15 minutes) for the ﬂuid to
equilibrate between each rotation.

C. Static Wetting Conﬁgurations
The vane dial angle is converted to the absolute acute interior angle oz between the vane and the major axis
of the ellipse as shown in Figure 11. Thus, oz in the various quadrants is determined from the vane angle gb:
For 0 < gb < 900, oz 2 Q5, for 900 < Q5 < 1800, oz = 1800 — Q5, for 1800 < Q5 < 2700, oz 2 Q5 — 1800, and for
2700 < gb < 3600, oz = 3600 — gb. The quadrant (Q1 through Q4) Where the particular wetting occurs is also
of concern and tabulated.

Each vane angle produces sub— anol/or supercritical wetting conditions for the two vane gaps as shown
in Figures 12 (VGl anol VG2). Supercritical conditions are characterized by spontaneous corner wetting. In
addition to vane gap wetting and dewetting a third wetting regime is observed Where the ﬂuid shifts from one
side of the vane to the other (Q5 2 530, Figure 12(a)). A detailed theoretical analysis of this phenomenon has
been completed and is presented elsewhere.10 Experiment repeatability is high ($10), but static interfaces
are not always established at angles sufﬁciently Close to the critical angles leading to a range Within Which
the ‘Critical angle’ is certainly crossed.

Figure 12(a) presents several key interfaces for a 00 to 1800 sweep for VGl. The sequence begins With
subcritical equilibrium surfaces at 00 and 360. Small—gap wetting (SGW) is observed at 430 and a complete
bulk shift (BS) at 530 Where the ﬂuid completely migrates to the left side of the vane. Notice that a bulk
shift occurs before large—gap wetting (LGW) Which takes place at 59.50. Small—gap wetting (SGW) and large
gap wetting (LGW) along With a complete bulk shift persist at 900. Large gap dewetting (LGD) occurs at
127.50 followed by a bulk shift reversal (ESE) at 134.50, and small gap dewetting (SGD) at 150.50. The
original but reﬂected conﬁguration of 00 returns at 1800.

VGl critical wetting and dewetting angles oz are reported in Table 2 for the four quadrants. The data
are arranged in order of occurrence: for increasing oz; small gap wetting, bulk shift, large gap wetting, and
for decreasing oz; large gap dewetting, bulk shift reversal, and small gap dewetting. When considering all
uncertainties these trends are common in all quadrants except in Quadrant 4 Where the bulk shift Clearly
occurs before the small gap wetting. This result signals the certain presence of slight container asymmetries
Which have been quantiﬁed and Will be published subsequently. This phenomena was uniquely exploited
providing a third dynamic wetting problem that could be investigated for a potentially crucial critical wetting
condition. Despite the presence of known vane alignment asymmetries, subsequent numerical computations
conﬁrm that the bulk shift can occur even for perfectly symmetric containers. These results are perhaps
surprising and to be addressed in greater detail in a forthcoming article Where both advantages and cautions
for such strong dependence of ﬂuid position on such slight changes or asymmetries in container geometry
is addressed. Comparisons of experimental and theoretical interfaces are provided in Figure 13 for VGl.
Theoretical critical angles are listed in Table 2. Only SGW and LGW are predicted for the ideally symmetric
conﬁgurations analyzed.

V. Interior Corner Flow (ICF)

The CFE Interior Corner Flow (ICF) experiments investigate bubble displacement as a result of secondary
imbibition in tapered polygonal conduits. The ICFl vessel has a geometric cross—seetion of a 300—750—75O
isosceles triangle that tapers uniformly (geometrically similar triangles) as shown in Figure 15(a). The height
of the triangular cross—seetion at the base is 40.0mm and at the top is 26.0mm over a height of 127.0mm—all
faces tilt at 3.1550. The test ﬂuid is 10ml of 50s Silicone oil. ICFZ is a rectangular cross—seetion that tapers
on two faces to a line as shown in Figure 15(b). The base rectangle measures 40.0mm Wide by 10.0mm deep.
The two faces tilt at 8.950 over a height of 127.0mm. The test ﬂuid is 9.02mi of 20s Silicone oil.

The basic operation of the experiment is as follows: the ﬂuid is injected into the tapered test Chamber
from the reservoir. During injection, the ﬂuid immediately Wicks along the corners toward the vertex. A
transition in the ﬂow takes place once the liquid reaches the vertex. This secondary imbibition appears like
a bubble migration Where the ullage or ‘bubble’ migrates toward the base, an example of Which is shown in
Figure 16 for ICFZ. The leading and trailing menisci are labeled in the ﬁgure as 22 and 21, respectively. The

bubble migration continues until the leading interface reaches the end of the conduit, the ﬂow ceasing shortly
thereafter. The experiment may be ‘reset’ to the initial state by manipulating the valves and reservoir piston
or by using a centrifuge method to return the ﬂuid to the base of the container. Either method permits
the experiment to be re—run indeﬁnitely. The four variations of the experiment are referred to as Dry, Wet,

Open Loop, and Bubbly tests and deﬁned below:

Dry: These tests are characterized by little to no liquid ﬁlm on the interior surfaces during the ﬂow. This
situation occurs during the ﬁrst run of the experiment since the interior surfaces are initially completely
dry. However, during repeat tests, a thin prewetting ﬁlm is present but the ﬂuid behaves essentially
identically to the initially dry test. Thus, all such tests are Classiﬁed as ‘Dry’. These test conditions
are achieved When using the valves and reservoir piston to reset the experiment.

Wet: When the ﬂuid is manually returned to the base of the tapered section using a centrifuge method,
signiﬁcant liquid ﬂlms remain on the interior walls that drain slowly. The presence of these thick ﬁlms
increases capillary ﬂow rates. Such tests are Classiﬁed as ‘Wet’.

Open Loop: For these tests the valves are opened permitting a parallel counter Clockwise ﬂow between the
base and vertex through a bypass conduit. The ‘Open Loop’ tests are considered a subset of the Wet
condition due to the moderately thick ﬁlms established before each test.

Bubbly: The fourth event type is called ‘Bubbly’ ﬂow Which is a repeat of previous tests but With numerous
bubbles in the ﬂuid. A variety of bubble sizes are created by vigorously shaking the container, resetting
the ﬂuid to the base, and then allowing the ﬂow to proceed passively. These tests are also a subset of
the Wet condition due to the presence of thick ﬁlms. The ﬂow With entrained bubbles demonstrates
the passive phase separation capability of such geometries and is used for theory development.

for the leading interface 232 before it reached the base of the container. Even for the trailing meniscus 271,
less than 20 seconds of ‘Clean’ data could be obtained for the trailing interface before base effects became
dominant. This trend is evident in Figure 17(a) Which plots the full duration for the trailing interface 21.
Figure 17(b) presents the ﬁrst 20s Where nearly linear trends are observed. The Characteristic time scale

computed from the theoretical model developed during the ﬂight of the ICF experiments is N 680s assuming
a Virtual vertex,11 Whereas the total experimental ﬂow time is less than 40s. Thus, the data in effect represent
only a snapshot of the intended idealized ﬂow rather than a long—time Characterization. However, for the
‘snapshot’ in Figure 17(b), the data is linear and can be thought of as a local derivative of the long—term
behavior.

From Figure 17(b) it is immediately obvious that the results vary depending on the test type. In
general, the Open Loop tests produce the highest ﬂow rates followed by Wet and then Dry conditions.
The ﬂow rates are somewhat sporadic between event types; however, the Open Loop, Wet, and Dry cases
produce average dimensional trailing meniscus velocities of 1.37, 1.06, and 0.85mm/s, respectively. The
linear trailing meniscus velocities for the various tests are non—dimensionalized (by way of an asymptotic

for the trailing 2:1 meniscus and nearly 4 minutes for the leading 82 meniscus. Figure 19 presents both Z1

Bubbly test are conducted. Approximately three distinct rates are obvious With Wet and Dry test behaving
similarly, Bubbly tests ﬂowing faster, and the Open Loop tests even faster. The Bubbly ﬁows progress at
a rate slightly greater than the Wet/Dry rate due to bubble coalescence Which has since been addressed
theoretically and Will be further documented in a subsequent publication. An expanded scale of the leading
and trailing interfaces can be found in Figure 20(a) for 231 and Figure 20(b) for 22.

The initial Dry run produces a curve ﬁt of 231 = 6.32 75040 Whereas Wet ﬁts are 2:1 2 6.2175040 and
231 = 7.22 75038. The rates are very similar, but if the two Wet rates are averaged they are slightly higher
than the Dry rate, Which is expected. The single Bubbly ﬁow produces a curve ﬁt of 231 = 5.1875044 and
a rate Which is always slightly higher than the Dry and Wet rates. During the bubble ﬂows, bubbles are
forced into the corner With only the smallest bubbles (< 0.7mm diameter) passing Without coalescing. The
Open Loop power—law curve ﬁts reveal higher rates, 231 = 13.9175030 and 231 = 16.00 75027, than the other test

to those reported for 2:1, With the hierarchy of migration rates being the same.

In preliminary summary of the CFE ICF experiments, it appears that the geometric impact of ICF—
like tapered polygonal sectioned containers can be reasonably and explicitly preolicteol.12 This implies that
systems can be designed to provide desired pumping rates for a variety of applications including low speed
bubbly ﬂow separations. For such calculations the desired ﬂow rate would be used as an input and the
container geometry would be ‘derived’. Ground—baseol applications for such a method are also relevant to
microﬂuidios phenomena.

VI. Conclusion

The fact that such simple experiments can yield enough quantitative data to support fundamental and
applied numerical and theoretical investigations argues well in support of continued efforts by space entities
to pursue simple experiments beneﬁtting from crew interest and interaction. Arguably more important,
intricate, and automated experiments are of higher priority, but such small experiments can ﬁt ﬂexibly into
time lines and even be conducted during the crew’s free time if desired (up to 50% of CFE was conducted
in this manner). At least three journal articles are expected from the CFE work and several of the tools
developed to analyze the ﬂows have been employed in advanced life support systems.13 Several follow—on
CFE—like experiments have been proposed to and are under development by NASA. The experiments are
called CFE—2 and consist of refurbished CFE hardware as well as news builds. The experiments themselves
focus on critical geometric wetting in systems With a Wide disparity in capillary length scales using the CFE
VG approach, and a family of weakly 3—D capillary conduits capable of passive phase separations relevant
to liquid processing on spacecraft—akin to CFE ICF. The new hardware exploits design guides developed
during this investigation.
