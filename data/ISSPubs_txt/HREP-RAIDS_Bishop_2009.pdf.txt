ABSTRACT
The RAIDS experiment is a suite of eight instruments to be ﬂown aboard the J apanese Experiment Module-Exposed
Facility 0n the International Space Station (188) in late 2009. Originally designed, built, and integrated onto the NOAA
T [1205-] satellite in 1993, the original RAIDS hardware and the mission Obj ectives have been modiﬁed for this 188
ﬂight Opportunity. In this paper we describe the four near infrared instruments on the RAIDS experiment covering the
wavelength range of 630 — 870 nm. Over the past two years these instruments have undergone modiﬁcation,
refurbishment, and testing in preparation for ﬂight. We present updated sensor Characteristics relevant to this new 188
mission and discuss performance stability in light of the long instrument storage period.
The four instruments, Operating in a limb scanning geometry, Will be used to Observe the spectral radiance of atomic and
molecular emission from the Earth’s upper atmospheric airglow. The passbands 0f the photometers are centered on the
atomic lines OI(777.4), OI[630.0], and the 0-0 band of O2 Atmospheric band at 765 nm. The spectrometer scans from
725 to 870 nm. These observations Will be used in conjunction With the other RAIDS instruments to investigate the
properties of the lower thermosphere and to improve understanding of the connections of the region to the space
environment, solar energy ﬂux and the lower atmosphere. These studies are fundamentally important to the
understanding the effects of the atmosphere and ionosphere on space systems and their Operation in areas such as satellite
drag, communications and navigation.

"2","1. INTRODUCTION
The Remote Atmospheric and Ionospheric Detection System or RAIDS experiment comprises eight optical
spectrometric instruments covering the wavelength interval 55 to 870 nm. RAIDS is a joint investigation by The
Aerospace Corporation and the Naval Research Lab (NRL). Originally designed and built in the late 1980’s, RAIDS was
scheduled for launch in 1993 on the NOAA T IROS—J satellite. Due to programmatic issues, RAIDS was removed from
the satellite and has remained in storage until 2007 when plans were made to host the experiment on the International
Space Station (188). RAIDS and the Hyperspectral Imager for the Coastal Ocean (HICO) experiment are combined into
the HICO/RAIDS Experiment Payload (HREP). HREP, scheduled for launch in September, 2009, will be the ﬁrst US
experiment placed on the J apanese Experiment Module (J EM), Kibo, successfully attached to the 188 in July 2009. The
original RAIDS experiment is described by Christensen eta].1 and McCoy et 621.2. For a more detailed description of the
current mission, ISS environment, and science objectives see the companion paper Budzz’en et al.3.
Figure 1 shows the completed RAIDS experiment to be mounted on Kibo Viewing in the anti-ram direction. RAIDS
includes a scan platform to scan all sensors vertically across the Earth’s limb except for the FUV Spectrograph, which is
ﬁxed on the baseplate. Of the eight instruments comprising RAIDS, we will be discussing the four NIR instruments: 777
nm Photometer (7 7 7 Phot), 630 nm Photometer (63 0Ph0t), Near Infrared Spectrometer (NIRS), and 765 nm Photometer
(7 65Ph0t), labeled in red in Figure 1. Each of these instruments employs a reﬂective telescope, bandpass ﬁlter, transfer
optics and ﬁber optical light pipe, a cooled photomultiplier tube, high voltage power supply and pulse ampliﬁer and
discriminator electronics. The photomultipliers are mounted in a detector box and cooled by a cold plate exposed to
space. Figure 1 also shows the Detector BOX (1) that houses the four instruments’ photomultiplier tubes and electronics.

2. MEASUREMENTS
The four near infrared instruments are designed to measure the dayglow and nightglow 0n the limb of the Earth and to
extract properties of the thermosphere and ionosphere. The primary obj ective is the derivation of temperature of the
thermospheric neutrals. This will be done by measuring the changes in the shape of the 02 Atm (0-0) band with altitude
0n the limb. Ionospheric obj ectives include the measurement of ionospheric properties based on radiative recombination
in the 01(7 7 7 .4) line and dissociative recombination in the OI[630.0] line.

"
"3","The NIR spectral region of the dayglow is dominated by atomic and molecular oxygen emissions as illustrated in Figure
2 from Broadfoot et al.5. At night, the molecular emissions primarily from OH and 02 originate below 100 km, so the
limb brightness of oxygen recombination emissions associated With higher altitude enhanced ionospheric densities can
be observed With ﬁlter photometers.

Measurement of the 02 Atm band shape is a powerful temperature sensing method covering the 100 — 200 km altitude
region. In the daytime, the 02 Atm band is produced by energy transfer collisions as

0119+02 —>0+02(12) (1)
The shape of the band varies With the temperature of the neutral gas Where the excitation occurs resulting in a double
peaked emission proﬁle. The ratio of the peaks is related to the temperature. The present approach Will use the 7 65Ph0t
to measure the 763.0 nm peak in the spectra and the NIRS set to measure the 759.0 nm peak
The ionospheric properties Will be inferred from nightglow observations With the 63 0Ph0t and 777Ph0t instruments. The
O(ID) 630.0 nm emission results from the dissociative recombination process followed by spontaneous emission of the
excited oxygen atoms as shown in the equations:

0; + e —> 0 + 0* (2)

0* —>0+hv(630nm) (3)
This nighttime emission is observed between 15 0-3 50 km With a peak emission altitude near 250 km. N2 quenches this
emission. This process allows us to infer the density of 0+, 02, and N2. 0+ is the dominant ion species in the ionospheric
F—region (>150 km). Thus, this emission Will provide an estimate of the ionospheric density. Because of the orbital
latitude of the 188, the 630.0 nm emission may provide information on F region plasma depletions also known as
equatorial spread-F (ESF). Several studies using ground-based 630.0 nm observations have focused on the evolution,
ﬁne structure, and associated velocities of ESF6’7’8. The OI(777.4) nighttime emission is the result of radiative
recombination in the ionospheric F region, hence generally peaking near 300-400 km altitude. The process is Via the
following:

0+ + e —> 0613] (4)

O(SP) —> 065} h V(777.4nm) (5)
Hence the emission rate of the 777 .4 emission is proportional to the product of the 0+ and electron densities. In the F
region, these two quantities are about equal, hence the volume emission rate varies as the square of the electron density.

a (777.4) ~ ne 2 (6)
The limb scan Will then provide an altitude proﬁle of the electron density integrated along the line of sight.

3. INSTRUMENTS AND ELECTRONICS
3.1 Photometers
The RAIDS NIR suite contains three photometers centered at 777 .4 nm, 630.0 nm, and 765.0 nm wavelengths. This is
changed from the original design Where a 589 nm photometer for measuring sodium emission has been replace With a
765 nm photometer for measuring O2At1n.
All three RAIDS photometers have a similar optical design, shown in Figure 3. The 7 7 7 Phot and the 63 0Ph0t consist of
1/4 In focal length telescopes With an aperture of 42 X 50 mm. The 7 65Ph0t has a 1/8 In telescope With an aperture of 21
X 25 mm. The general Characteristics of the photometers are listed in Table 2.

765Phot 200

The 1/ 8 In NIR instruments are intended to operate during the day to provide accurate radiance proﬁles vertically above
the limb in the presence of signiﬁcant sources of background and scattered light. As a result the off-aXis rej ection
performance of the telescope and suppression of internal scattering are very important in these instruments. In operation,
there are strong vertical gradients in the emission rate of the O2 Atm band that drives the requirement for good off-aXis
rej ection. Also, near the lower limits of the altitude scan, Rayleigh scattered sunlight is important. Sources also include
Earthshine, sun light scattered from the lower atmosphere, solar scattered light from structures on the ISS, and direct
sunlight.

Figure 3. Illustration of photometer and its connection to the Detector Box. All three photometers have similar layouts.
Prior to any modiﬁcations to the photometers, an off-aXis rej ection test was performed to quantify any changes in the
performance of the bafﬂe system since the early tests on the system. The new tests were performed at NRL. Because of
the similarity between all four telescopes in terms of material, paint, and bafﬂe system, the highest priority sensor,
7 65Phot, was selected for testing The instrument was not removed from the RAIDS instrument, so the full RAIDS
package to be maneuvered with a rotation/translation stage. The ﬁber optic from the telescope was connected to a
laboratory photomultiplier for the test. A high voltage supply, counter and current monitor completed the conﬁguration
setup. The dynamic range of the photomultiplier system using current measurements and photon counting modes was
approximately ten orders of magnitude. A white light point source was provided by a collimated beam using a Gemini
300 white light source at 44 ft from RAIDS. The off-aXis test was performed across the slit (the vertical scanning
direction) and the results are shown in Figure 4. The red line represents the new measurements. Since the setup and
source differed between the two measurements, the intensity values are not the same. The results agree extremely well
within 20 of the slit. The slight rise in the right shoulder is likely due to a glint surface on the photometer covers that are
ej ected 0n orbit. The excellent results provided conﬁdence that it is unlikely that the rej ection proﬁle has changed for the
other two photometers. The tight refurbishment and testing schedule precluded any further off-aXis testing of the
photometers.

"6","The original 589 nm ﬁlter was removed and replaced with the 765 nm ﬁlter in support of the revised science priorities,
discussed in Section 4. The original 589 nm ﬁlter was inspected and surface variations due to aging were noted. Based
on the deterioration of the 589 nm ﬁlter it was decided to replace the other two ﬁlters. The replacement ﬁlters were 0.5
mm thicker than the originals resulting in removal of material from the spacer between the lens and ﬁlter (see Figure 3)
assembly to maintain minimal pressure on the ﬁlter.
3.2 NIR Spectrometer
The NIR spectrometer, illustrated in Figure 5 , consists of an 1/8 meter telescope with bafﬂing, an f/5, 1/ 8 m focal length
Ebert-Fastie rnonochromatorg’10 using off-aXis spherical mirrors, transfer optics, an order sorting ﬁlter, ﬁber transfer
optics, photomultiplier detector, and electronics. Housed by the spectrometer, the grating has a ruled area of 25 X 25 mm2
with 1800 lines/rnm and with the ﬁrst order blaze at 750 nm. It had an original efﬁciency of 40%. Within the 740-870
nm wavelength range, the slit function is triangular with a FWHM of 0.84.
Due to schedule and cost limitations, no modiﬁcations were made to the NIR spectrometer itself. We performed
calibration work to determine whether the instrument aged in storage. Figure 6 shows the original responsivity values
measured in 1989. The most recent calibration results are listed in Table 2.

"8","3.3. Detector BOX Modiﬁcations
A signiﬁcant amount of the refurbishment activities focused on the Detector BOX that houses the photomultiplier tubes
and the High Voltage/Pulse Amplitude Discriminator (HV/PAD) units shown in Figure 1(1). The detector box is
connected optically t0 the four instruments using 3 mm diameter ﬁber optic cables of various lengths. One side of the
detector box consists of a radiator panel that extends past the main box dimensions as seen in Figure 1 (I).
In May 2007 a liveliness test and a preliminary responsivity calibration was performed at NRL 0n the photometers and
NIR spectrometer. Following analysis of the test results and discussions regarding PMT degradation with time we
decided to replace all four photomultiplier tubes. The closest replacement to the original Hamarnatsu R1824 series PMT
was the Harnamatsu R943-O7 series. These tubes have GaAS photocathodes with a quantum efﬁciency of 18% at 750 nm
and glass windows. One rnaj or difference between the two PMTs is their length; the new R943-O7 series is signiﬁcantly
shorter. In the original detector box, plastic sockets were used. Now a ceramic socket is recommended for PMT
operations at cold temperatures (-ZOOC). The change in PMT length and the use of a different socket type required
signiﬁcant mechanical modiﬁcations of the PMT housings.
Environmental testing was performed separately on the detector box prior to RAIDS instrument integration. During the
Vibration test, a failure occurred in a PAD unit. An original RAIDS spare unit was substituted. However, during thermal
testing it showed anomalous high voltage behavior at cold temperatures. Replacement HV/PADs were not available
since the supplier (RSI) no longer produces these types of units. We decided to replace the faulty unit with a RSI model
#47 -209, built during the same period as the original units and used on sounding rocket missions. The replacement unit
was shorter in all three dimensions necessitating a mounting plate to be added. The replacement unit is associated with
the 7 7 7Phot.
The ﬁnal detector box modiﬁcation involved the radiator panel and box housing. To minimize the dark count rates, the
PMTs must be cooled to at least -200 C. Based on analysis of the new thermal environment to be experienced by RAIDS
0n the 188, a larger radiator was afﬁxed to the box. This resulted in a slight modiﬁcation to one side of the housing that
connects to the radiator panel. Additionally, all four ﬁber optic cables were replaced.

"9","4. TEMPERATURE RETRIEVAL ALGORITHM
The NIR spectrometer and the 7 65Ph0t data will be used to determine daytime neutral temperatures in the lower
thermosphere between 100-200 km, the mission’s primary science goal. RAIDS will be able to characterize the vertical
temperature structure and variations in the strong temperature gradient present in this altitude range. These important
variables and their relationship to lower atmospheric tidal inputs, magnetospheric energy transfer and solar variability
have not been measured systematically up to this time. This is illustrated in Figure 8, which places the RAIDS
measurements in the context of previous thermospheric temperature measurements.
The OZAtIn band proﬁle depends on the local temperature of the atmosphere in the emission region. Hence, in principle
a measurement of the band shape carries a signature of the atmospheric temperature along the line of sight of a limb
Viewing instrument. In the approach taken here, we plan to measure the (0,0) transition in the band. In the lower altitudes
of interest, the band becomes optically thick and effects of multiple scattering are important. Hence below about 100 km
a multiple scattering code is needed to infer the temperature of the atmosphere from measurement of the band shape.
Above about 110 km the band becomes optically thin and the temperature may be inferred by measuring the ratio of the
brightness of the two peaks in the band proﬁle. This fact has been exploited in previous aeronomic investigations of the
atmospheric temperature near 100 km11
For RAIDS we plan to measure the ratio of the two peaks in the spectrum by setting the NIR 0n the 760 nm peak and
using the 7 65Phot to measure the brightness of the long wavelength peak. By scanning the RAIDS platform in elevation
angle, the limb proﬁle for both peaks will be obtained. Using an Abel inversion technique13 we plan to invert the
measured intensities in both RAIDS bandpass to produce the volume emission rates at each tangent altitude.

"10","To illustrate the sensitivity of this approach to changes in the neutral temperatures, we calculated the band proﬁle as a
function of temperature from 100 to 2100 degrees following Krassovskyu. Since, as noted above, this proﬁle changes
with temperature, a ratio of these two emission rates in the two bands allows us to calculate the temperature. The RAIDS
temperature retrieval will be limited to between 100 and 200 km. Below 100 km the 02A (0,0) band becomes optically
thick greatly complicating the inversion while above 200 km the expected low signal results in large counting
uncertainties causing (above 10%) uncertainties in the retrieved temperature.
Figures 9 -11 shows some results of a simulated RAIDS analysis for an MSIS atmosphere at 12 Local Time on J anuary
1, 2000 at 00 latitude and longitude. The top panel of Figure 9 shows the temperature for this atmosphere as a function of
altitude from 100 to 200 km. The middle panel of Figure 9 shows the limb brightness, due to O2 Atm band emission, that
would be seen by the NIR spectrometer if ﬁxed at 760 nm as a function of altitude. These limb brightness were
calculated by integrating along the line of site from the RAIDS platform to the limb O2 Atm volume emission rates
obtained following Bucholtz et al.14. The bottom panel of Figure 9 shows the ratio of the volume emission rates for the
NIR spectrometer and the 7 65Phot and limb brightness as a function of altitude.

Figure 10. Top panel shows a demonstration of the temperature retrieval algorithm (crosses) and the original model temperature
Figure 10 gives an estimate of the uncertainty in the temperature retrievals given the expected signals based on the
responsivities given in Table 2 for the RAIDS NIR spectrometer and 7 65Phot. The top panel shows the model
temperature proﬁle along with the temperature proﬁle retrieved by (1) applying the Abel transform to obtain the volume
emission rates (vers) as a function of altitude and then (2) smooth these rates over 3 km below 140 km and 10 km above
140 km altitude, and (3) dividing the volume emission rates to obtain the temperature. The 3 km smoothing is based on
the estimated limb vertical resolution. However, above about 140 km as the limb brightness decreases the uncertainty in
the temperature retrieval will increase and we estimate the actual vertical resolution will be degraded. In this simulation
we use 10 km. The structure in the retrieved temperatures is solely due to counting statistics. The bottom panel shows the
fractional uncertainty that typically range about +/- 10%. Above 100 km the atmosphere is optically thin and no effects
from multiple scatters eXists. The small uncertainty results from the large SNR above 100 km.
The results in Figure 10 were obtained over one RAIDS vertical scan. The time it takes to go from 100 to 200 km is
about 21 s. Thus, the horizontal size for each scan is about 150 km. If RAIDS operates in a dither mode so that the scan
is limited to slightly below 100 km and slightly above 200 km scans could be obtained every 40 s or so. Thus, RAIDS
temperature proﬁles would be spaced at approximately 300 km horizontally. If we add 5 such scans together, to give
1500 km horizontal resolution, the noise decreases and Figure 11 shows the results. Now the uncertainty up to 180 km is
generally below 5%. This should be adequate for tida1 analysis.

5. SUMMARY
The RAIDS NIR spectrometer and three photometers have undergone minor refurbishment and modiﬁcations in
preparation for the placement of the instrument suite on the 188 in September 2009. Laboratory testing was performed
providing current responsivity values for the four instruments and showing no degradation in the off-aXis light rej ection
across the instruments’ s1it Width.
Once in orbit the NIR spectrometer and the 7 65Ph0t Will measure the neutral temperature altitude proﬁle between 100-
200 km, providing ﬁrst ever continuous measurements of this altitude region. The 7 7 7 Phot and 63 0Ph0t Will provide
measurements of the ion and electron densities in the ionospheric F-region.
