Abstract
Effects of continuous hypergraVity stimuli on the amounts and composition of cell wall constituents were investigated in Wheat
shoots. HypergraVity (300 g) treatment for three days after germination increased the net amount of cell wall polysaccharides such as
hemicellulose and cellulose, but reduced the shoot elongation. As a result, the amount of cell wall polysaccharides per unit length of
shoot increased under hypergraVity. The hemicellulose fraction contained polysaccharides in the middle and low molecular mass
range (5 kDa—l MDa) and increased in response to hypergraVity. Also, the amounts of arabinose (Ara) and xylose (Xyl), the major
sugar components of the hemicellulose fraction, increased under hypergraVity conditions. In addition to wall polysaccharides,
hypergraVity increased the amounts of cell wall—bound phenolic acids, such as ferulic acid (FA) and diferulic acid (DFA). Further-
more, the activity of phenylalanine ammonia—lyase (PAL, EC 4.3.1.5) was enhanced under hypergraVity conditions. These results
suggest that continuous hypergraVity stimulates the synthesis of cell wall constituents, especially hemicellulosic arabinoxylans
and cell wall—bound FA and DFA in Wheat shoots. The increased PAL activity may promote the formation of FA and DFA. These
changes in cell wall architecture may be involved in making rigid and tough cell walls under hypergraVity conditions and thereby
contribute to the ability of plant to sustain their structures against gravitational stimuli.
