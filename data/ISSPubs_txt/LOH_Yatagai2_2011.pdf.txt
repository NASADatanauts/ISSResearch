Abstract
In View of the concern for the health of astronauts that may one day journey to Mars or the Moon, we investigated the effect that
space radiation and microgravity might have on DNA damage and repair. We sent frozen human lymphoblastoid TK6 cells to the Inter—
national Space Station where they were maintained under frozen conditions during a 134—day mission (14 November 2008 to 28 March
2009) except for an incubation period of 8 days under 1G or ttG conditions in a C02 incubator. The incubation period started after 100
days during which the cells had been exposed to 54 mSV of space radiation. The incubated cells were then refrozen, returned to Earth,
and compared to ground control samples for the determination of the inﬂuence of microgravity on cell survival and mutation induction.
The results for both varied from experiment to experiment, yielding a large SD, but the MG sample results differed signiﬁcantly from the
1G sample results for each of 2 experiments, with the mean ratio of HG to 1G being 0.55 for the concentration of Viable cells and 0.59 for
the fraction of thymidine kinase deﬁcient (TK‘) mutants. Among the mutants, non—loss of zygosity events (point mutations) were less
frequent (31%) after ttG incubation than after 1G incubation, which might be explained by the inﬂuence of HG on cellular metabolic or
physiological function. Additional experiments are needed to clarify the effect of HG interferes on DNA repair.
