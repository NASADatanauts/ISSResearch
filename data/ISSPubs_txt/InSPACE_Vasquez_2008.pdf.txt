We present studies of colloidal suspensions of magnetizable particles with the aim of
understanding the kinetics and underlying microstructural evolution of the liquid-solid
transitions these systems exhibit in external magnetic ﬁelds. Critically, such studies are
limited on Earth due to catastrophic sedimentation 0f the suspensions. Structural changes
are investigated under steady and intermittent (pulsed) magnetic ﬁelds. Here, we focus on
image processing methods used to extract structural information from video microscopy
data obtained from InSPACE experiments carried out in the Microgravity Science Glovebox
0n the International Space Station. These experiments provide important information for
the development of magnetorheological (MR) ﬂuids in technological applications, such as
actuators and sensors, while also providing critical insight into the fundamental physics of
liquid-solid transitions.

I. Introduction

Magnetorheological (MR) ﬂuids exhibit a rapid transition from a liquid— to a solid—like state upon the
application of a magnetic ﬁeld. An important property of these ﬂuids is their ability to achieve a Wide
range of viscosities in a small fraction of time. These rapid, reversible Changes in Viscosity can be used to
effectively control Vibrations in applications dealing With actuation, damping, and robotics. Additionally,
these materials present many advantages in applications that require fast response, strength, tunability, and
physical ﬂexibility, such as feedback—controlled shock absorbers and high performance suspension systems.1
Applications to space exploration include potential use in robots, rovers, and crew suits (mobility augmenta—
tion), especially for endurance and fatigue countermeasure designs that aid in lifting, moving and supporting
loads during extra—vehicular activities (EVA’S).

The essential Characteristics of MR ﬂuids are their ability to respond rapidly to the application of an
external ﬁeld and their ability to support stresses transverse to the applied ﬁeld. The basis of these properties
lies in the rapid formation of chains of dipolar particles along the ﬁeld direction. During the application of
an external ﬁeld, particles in an MR suspension acquire dipole moments, mi, proportional to the magnetic
ﬁeld, H,

The parameter A is introduced as a measure of the competition between dipolar interactions and Brownian
motion. This non—dimensional ﬁeld strength is deﬁned as the ratio of the maximum interaction energy,
calculated from Eqn (2), and the thermal energy,

When the dipolar interaction between particles exceeds the thermal energy, A > 1, the particles aggregate
to form Chains of dipoles aligned in the ﬁeld direction. Because energy is required to deform and break these
Chains, such micro—struetural transition is responsible for the onset of a large “tunable” yield stress. Thus,
the formation of well—deﬁned microstructures in an MR suspension offers a Clear example of the interplay
between anisotropic particle interactions, structure, and rheology.

When exposed to a continuous magnetic ﬁeld, particles in a dilute suspension form linear Chains aligned
With the external ﬁeld. For an example, see Fig. 1(a). At higher particle concentrations, lateral aggregation
between neighboring Chains is driven by ﬂuctuations along the length of the Chains.4’ 6 When these Chains are
sufﬁciently dense, the columns cross—link to form an interconnected network as the one shown in Fig. 1(b).

When subjected to a pulsed magnetic ﬁeld, the intertwined network of Chains Will relax into lower energy
ellipsoidal 0r columnar aggregates more typical of an equilibrium phase.7*9 These low energy states are
condensed states such as columns and sheets and differ from the intertwined networks initially formed in the
applied ﬁeld, for example see Figure 2. Furthermore, the structures that result from a continuous ﬁeld are
determined by kinetics, and are rarely structures of lowest energy. In contrast, by allowing particle diffusion
during an intermittent ﬁeld—oﬁ state, a pulsed ﬁeld permits particle rearrangement so that the suspension
can adopt a lower energy structure.7’8

(far left), the particles form a ﬁbrous network. At later times the network evolves into low energy ellipsoidal
structures. The last 3 pictures correspond to 3 min, 15 min, and 1 h of pulsed ﬁeld, respectively.7’8

The goal of InSPACE is to study the response of MR ﬁuids under continuous and pulsed magnetic ﬁelds
in a microgravity environment. Due to the inﬂuence of gravity, the ﬂuctuations in a concentrated suspen—
sion of strongly interacting Chains cannot be easily studied. Individual Chains are relatively stable When
they are Close to density—matched With the suspending solvent, since their mass and the Viscous drag both

the mass grows much more rapidly than the Viscous resistance and this is quickly followed by catastrophic
sedimentation. The complications associated with these phenomena are overcome in the microgravity envi—
ronment. Microgravity eliminates the need for density matching, and expands the range of aggregate sizes
and suspension concentrations accessible experimentally.

In this paper we present recent progress in the analysis of InSPACE experiments conducted in the
Microgravity Science Glovebox (MSG) in the International Space Station (ISS). The paper is divided as
follows: In Section II we present the experimental setup and samples used for InSPACE experiments in the
MSG. Next, in Section III, we describe the different methods and tools used to process and analyze the
images collected from such experiments. Finally, conclusions and on—going work are discussed in Section IV.

II. Experimental Operations

The MR ﬂuid samples are composed of monodisperse micrometer—diameter magnetizable particles sus—
pended in an aqueous medium. The samples prepared for InSPACE were ferroﬁuid emulsions consisting of
iron oxide nanoparticles suspended in a solution of sodium dodecyl sulfate, anionic surfactant, and ultrapure
water. These samples were comprised of uniform particles sizes of 0.31, 0.40, and 0.66 um and volume
fraction Q5 2 0.2%. The parameters varied during the series of tests were the ﬁeld strength, the particle size,
and the pulse frequency.

The experimental setup of InSPACE, shown in Figure 3(a), includes three main assemblies: coil, optics,
and avionics. The coil assembly, attached to the base of the MSG, holds a Helmholtz coil containing
sealed Vials 0f the ﬂuid, the camera lens assemblies, and a power controller. The optics assembly includes
two cameras for imaging, one from a straight—on View (ST) and another for right—angle View (RT), with a
backlighting system illuminating the samples. The ﬁeld of View of the cameras is as follows:

ST: 0.3473 mm X 0.2559 mm
RT: 0.3611 mm X 0.2591 mm.
Here the ST—View is the View parallel to the applied magnetic ﬁeld, and RT—View is perpendicular to the
ﬁeld. See Figure 3(b).

view (perpendicular to the applied ﬁeld) cameras capture the lateral view of structures as they form parallel
to the external ﬁeld. The ST—View (camera parallel to the applied ﬁeld) allows to capture the evolution of the
aggregates’ cross sectional area.
An electrical current and frequency were set on an avionics assembly to produce and control a pulsed or
continuous magnetic ﬁeld inside the coil. Such magnetic ﬁeld causes the particles in the ﬂuid to assemble
together, or reversibly aggregate, and form microstructures. The cameras recorded the microstructures, and
the resulting Video microscopy data is then analyzed.
III. Processing and Analysis of Video Microscopy Data

In this section we describe the various image pre—processing and processing techniques developed for the

analysis of the images extracted from the Video mircoscopy data from InSPACE experiments.

"
"4","A. Image Pre—processing

The post—ﬁight study of the microscopic structures is performed by digitization of the Video microscopy data.
The Video data is transferred from digital Video cassettes to a hard drive ﬁle. The individual Video frames are
extracted from these Video ﬁles, and the images are converted into gray scale. A mask of the “ST” 01‘ “RT”
letters is created and subtracted from the images. Image pre—processing is then performed including ﬁltering
operations in both spatial and frequency domains. We use the image processing toolbox 0f Matlab to both
pre—process the image and for image analysis, and we use the software Image] for image pre—processing.

The ﬁrst step in our ﬁltering process is to compute the 2D Fourier transform of the image using the
two—dimensional fast Fourier transform algorithm. A low—pass ﬁlter5 is applied to the frequency domain
and the inverse Fourier transform is then computed. Finally, a rolling ball algorithm10 is used to remove
the background and we perform a local histogram equalization in the resulting image to improve the image
ﬁdelity. An example of the image processing steps is shown in Figure 4. Here the images show the cross—
sectional area of columns formed in the sample after 9 min in a continuous ﬁeld.

To improve the analysis of the different microstructures, the resulting images are then converted into
binary images. A drawback of this ﬁnal step is that it can only be effectively applied to images that eXhibit
a uniform distribution of aggregate shape and area. This is usually the case when the applied ﬁeld is
continuous, as the example shown in Figure 4. When the structures become larger, rather than considering
the whole spatial domain, the image is cropped to capture only the zone of interest. This method is suitable
to the study of the low energy structures that are formed during a pulsed ﬁeld, since each of such structures
are unique in size and shape. In addition, cropping becomes especially useful in the study of the ejection and
attraction processes observed throughout the depletion zones formed around the aggregates. For instance,
Figure 5 shows the cross—sectional area of aggregates formed in a pulsed ﬁeld. Here the main objective is
to extract data that allow us to describe the ejection and attraction dynamics; as a result the analysis is
greatly improved by cropping around the aggregate depletion zone.

B. Particle Tracking

We use thresholding techniques for aggregate detection and measurement of aggregate area. A Matlab
adaptation of IDL particle tracking software developed by David Grier, John Crocker,3 and Eric Weeks is
used to analyze displacement of particles and aggregates. The Matlab code was developed by Daniel Blair
and Eric Duﬁ‘esne.2 After the centroid of each aggregate is located, we use a Delaunay triangulation to ﬁnd
its nearest neighbor. Next, distances to nearest neighbors are averaged to ﬁnd the mean spacing between
aggregates. As an illustration, we show in Figure 6(a) the resulting binary image corresponding to the last
image in Figure 4, and in Figure 6(b), we have plotted the coordinates of the centroids and the corresponding
Delaunay triangulation.

Figure 7 is an example of how the coarsening process is quantiﬁed through calculations of the aggregate’s
cross—sectional area and number of aggregates. Figure 7(a) corresponds to the data in Figure 4, i.e. after

whole image and then processed. In this ﬁgure the image is cropped to capture only the aggregates that are
being ejected and facilitate the tracking process used to calculate their displacement.

"6","C. Fourier Methods

A discrete Fourier analysis transforms a sample of data points into a sum of component sine waves of
different frequencies and amplitudes. The Fourier power spectrum, i.e. the squared amplitudes over all
Fourier components, gives the relative contribution of the different frequencies to variations of the total
energy of the original function. Radial averages of the power spectrum allow us to determine the peak
spatial frequencies of variation, which can be used to estimate the average distance between neighboring
aggregates, similar to the analysis of scattering experiments. An example of this is shown in Figure 8(a).

After the Fourier spectrum is radially averaged, we use a least squares method to ﬁnd its best ﬁt to the

following Gaussian,

H —— epo—i w
01 C3 01
Equation (4) is then differentiated to calculate the maximum in the curve recorded as the average spacing
between aggregates. These results are used to follow the evolution of aggregate spacing with time. For
example, see Figure 8(b).

The squared points represent the maximum at each curve.

As a validation of the two different methods used to calculate the average spacing between aggregates,
in Figure 9 we plot together data extracted using particle tracking algorithms with that collected through
Fourier methods. In that ﬁgure, the average aggregate’s diameter is added to the Fourier data, so that it
represents distance between centroids rather than spacing between aggregates.

D. Supplementary Observations in RT-View

Data obtained from ST—View Videos by means of the methods described in previous sections are comple—
mented with observations of the lateral interactions between aggregates obtained from RT—View Videos. The
most important information obtained from RT—View images is the evolution in time of the aggregate size and
spacing. Although, most of these observations are rather qualitative, and their main purpose is to support
qualitative data obtained form ST—View, we still rely on image processing techniques to facilitate such ob—
servations. As before we use ﬁltering in the Fourier domain, however in this case we use convolution with a
“Sombrero” kernel5 for smoothing and edge detection, and histogram equalization to enhance contrast. An
example of the signiﬁcant improvement in the image quality is shown in Figure 10, where images before and
after pre—processing are compared.

To improve these observations, we calculate the autocorrelation of a given image to Visualize periodicity
of the structures. For example, Figure 11 shows three images and their respective autocorrelation. It can
be seen that as the aggregates Change in time, the autocorrelation images show the evolution of the size and
periodic arrangement of the aggregates.

IV. Conclus10ns

The uniqueness of the data collected by InSPACE experiments allows us to further investigate suspen—
sion structure and aggregate evolution in MR ﬂuids under both continuous and pulsed ﬁelds. On one hand,
microgravity enables a dramatic expansion over Earth—based experiments of the timescales over Which aggre—
gation kinetics and structure can be monitored , While InSPACE’s experimental setup gives us access to full
three—dimensional aggregation structure. We use Fourier methods and thresholding techniques to improve
the range of data quantiﬁable from the Videos recorded in the MSG. The different approaches described in
this paper are a ﬁrst, and crucial, step in the extraction of information from such Videos. After these Videos
are digitalized and the images processed, our objective is to analyze the resulting data under continuous and
pulsed ﬁelds.

First, using the Videos corresponding to experiments in a continuous ﬁeld, we Will extract data that
describe the evolution of the aggregates cross—sectional area, number of aggregates, and inter—aggregate
spacing. Such data Will help us to characterize and to further understand the aggregation kinetics of param—
agnetic particles under a magnetic ﬁeld. Information obtained from InSPACE tests Will complement existing
experimental observations conducted on Earth that are affected by gravity through sedimentation.

Similarly, for experiments in a pulsed ﬁeld, we Will extract data describing the evolution of the aggre—
gates cross—sectional area, shape, and spacing; following the methods described in this paper. We Will also
investigate the dynamics of attraction and ejection of columns during pulsed ﬁeld, this data Will include
relative size of depletion zones and ejection/attraction velocity. Finally, dependence of the ﬁnal lOW—energy
