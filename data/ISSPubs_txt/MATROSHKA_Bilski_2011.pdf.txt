Cosmic radiation LiF) used in frame of the MATROSHKA experiment by three laboratories (DLR Cologne, ATI Vienna and IF]
TL efﬁciency Krakow) for radiation in space and several ion beams, has been compared. For LiF:Mg,Ti detectors a very
good agreement between results obtained by the three laboratories was observed, both for space and
accelerator—based exposures. This should be considered a remarkable result, taking into account that the
studied TLDs originated from six different batches, manufactured by two producers exploiting different
production techniques and were processed by three laboratories, using signiﬁcantly different protocols
(annealing, readout, calibration, glow—curve analysis). Another type of TL detectors, LiF:Mg,Cu,P, was
found to show response to cosmic radiation lower than that of LiF:Mg,Ti by 5%—18%.
