A novel, Gram—negative, non—spore—forming, pleomorphic yellow—orange bacterial
strain was isolated from a stadium seat. Strain CoronadoT falls within the
Erythrobacteraceae family and the genus Porphyrobacter based on 16S rRNA phylo—
genetic analysis. This strain has Q— 10 as the predominant respiratory lipoquinone, as
do other members of the family. The fatty acid proﬁle of this strain is similar to other
Porphyrobacter, however CoronadoT contains predominately C18: 1w7cis and C16:O,
a high percentage of the latter not being observed in any other Erythrobacteraceae.
This strain is catalase—positive and oxidase—negative, can grow from 4 to 28 0C, at
NaCl concentrations 0.1—1.5%, and at pH 6.0—8.0. On the basis of phenotypic and
phylogenetic data presented in this study, strain CoronadoT represents a novel species
in the Porphyrobacter genus for which the name Porphyrobacter mercurialis sp. nov. is
proposed; the type strain is CoronadoT (=DSMZ 29971, =LMG 28700).

Academic editor In this study, strain CoronadoT was isolated from a stadium seat at Niedermeyer Field,
Pankaj Arora Coronado High School in Coronado, California, USA as part of a nationwide Citizen
Additional |nf0rmation and Science project (Project MERCCURI— www.spacemicrobesorg). One goal of Project
Declarations can be found on MERCCURI was to collect bacterial isolates to be used for an experiment aboard the
page 10 International Space Station (188). The 16S rRNA gene sequenced from this particular
DO' 10°7717/Peerj°1400 isolate was at least 99% identical to rRNA genes from a few uncultured organisms.
® Copyright Uncultured isolates with high identity (=>99%) were found in samples from deep
2015 C011 et 811' ocean sediment and the human skin microbiome. However, the highest identity to a

A phylogenetic analysis of the Alphaproteobacteria class led in 2005 to the creation of
a new family, Erythrobactemceae, to house the genera Erythrobacter, Porphyrobacter and
Erythromicrobium (Lee et al., 2005). These genera were later joined by Altererythrobac-
ter (Kwon et al., 2007) and Croceicoccus (Xu et al., 2009), the latter work also emended the
description of the family. Members of the Erythrobactemceae family are Gram—negative,
aerobic bacteria that contain carotenoids, usually appearing pink, orange or yellow. They
do not form spores, are chemo—organotrophic, and are most often associated with aquatic
environments. The Porphyrobacter genus was established in 1993 with the description of
Porphyrobacter neustonensis, isolated from freshwater (Fuerst et al., 1993). All subsequent
Porphyrobacter species have also been isolated from aquatic sources (hot springs, seawater,
and swimming pools) including P. tepidarius (Hanada et al., 1997), P. sanguineus (Hiraishi
et al., 2002), P. cryptus (Rainey et al., 2003), P. donghaensis (Yoon, Lee 6’? Oh, 2004), P.
dokdonensis (Yoon et al., 2006) and P. colymbi (Furuhata et al., 2013).

Phylogenetic and biochemical characteristics presented here show that our isolate
is clearly distinct from other members within the Erythrobactemceae family and is
most closely related to the genus Porphyrobacter. However, a major taxonomic revision
of this family is most likely required, as has been suggested by others (e.g., Rainey
et al., 2003; Huang et al., 2015). Here we describe the genotypic, morphologic, and
biochemical characteristics of strain CoronadoT, based on which we propose the name
ofPorphyrobacter mercurialis sp. nOV.

Cells were initially grown on plates containing either Reasoner’s 2A agar (R2A), 0r lysogeny
broth agar (LB). LB was made with 10 g tryptone, 10 g NaCl, and 5 g yeast extract per
liter. A clear preference for growth on LB was observed and so was used for all subsequent
experiments. Salt tolerance was measured by growth in liquid media (25 °C) from 0%

to 20% w/V NaCl. pH tolerance was measured by growth in liquid media (25 °C) from
pH 3.4 to pH 8.0. Temperature preference was measured by growth in liquid culture
across the range 4 °C—30 °C. Growth in microgravity (OD600) was measured aboard the
International Space Station (188).

Cell morphology, motility, and presence/absence of ﬂagella were examined by light mi—
croscopy (Zeiss AXio Lab.A1) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM). Cell cultures
in either exponential or stationary phase were prepared for TEM by the UC Davis Electron
Microscopy lab as follows. 400 mesh copper grids with formvar/carbon support ﬁlm (Ted
Pella, Inc., Redding, CA) were placed on dental waX. A 10 le drop of ﬁxed or unﬁxed
sample was placed onto the grid and left in a dust—free environment for 10 min. Then
excess was wicked off with ﬁlter paper. A 10 le drop of 1% PTA pH 5.8 (phosphotungstic
acid) or 1% ammonium molybdate in double—distilled water was added to the grid and
wicked off immediately. Grids were allowed to air—dry completely before Viewing in a
Philips CM120 (FEI/Philips Inc., Hillsborough, Or.) electron microscope at 80 KV.

Oxidase activity was measured using a solution of tetramethyl—p—phenylenediamine
and catalase activity was measured by the addition of hydrogen peroxide to plated cells.

The hydrolysis of starch and casein were measured by standard plate methods (beef agar
with soluble starch and iodine staining, and milk agar with a pancreatic digest of casein
respectively). Carbon source oxidation was assayed using the Phenotypic MicroArray
(TM) services offered by Biolog, Inc. using their standard procedures for gram—negative
bacteria as follows. Colonies were grown on blood agar at room temperature and
suspended in IF—Oa inoculating ﬂuid (Biolog) to a density of 42% transmittance. The cell
suspension was diluted 1:6 in IF—Oa plus 1X Dye H (Biolog) and a carbon source utilization
MicroPlate (PMl; Biolog) was inoculated with 100 yd per well. The PMl microplate was
incubated at 23 °C and read by the OmniLog instrument every 15 min for 96 h. Duplicate
sets of OmniLog data were converted to average read value and a threshold of 78 was
required in both replicates for a positive call.

Respiratory quinones, polar lips, and fatty acids
Cells were grown to post exponential phase (~72 h) in 1 L of LB at 23 °C for large—scale
biomass production, then centrifuged to pellet cells and lyopholized (VirTis Freeze—
mobile). Analysis of respiratory quinones/polar lipids and fatty acids were carried out
by the Identiﬁcation Service, DSMZ, Braunschweig. Germany. Protocol details and
references can be found at the following DSMZ pages; https://www.dsmz.de/serVices/

16$ rDNA, genome sequencing, and phylogenetic analysis
Genomic DNA was extracted using a Wizard Genomic DNA Puriﬁcation Kit
(Promega). A nearly full—length 16S rRNA gene sequence was ampliﬁed using the 27F
(5’—AGAGTTTGATCMTGGCTCAG—3’ ) and 1391R (5’—GACGGGCGGTGTGTRCA—3’ )
“universal” primers. Sanger sequencing was provided by the College of Biological
Science UC—DNA Sequencing Facility (UC Davis). This DNA was also used for Illumina
sequencing of the draft genome as described elsewhere (Coil e’r Eisen, in press). The genome
sequence was annotated using the RAST server (Aziz et al., 2008; Overbeek et al., 2013).
The 1482bp 16S rDNA sequence was obtained from the genome assembly in RAST
(GenBank: KP122961), and uploaded to the Ribosomal Database Project (RDP) (Cole et
al., 2013). Since the RDP database is incomplete with respect to the Erythrobactemceae
family, additional type strain sequences were obtained from NCBI to ensure that every
member of the family with ofﬁcial standing in nomenclature (http://www.bacteri0.
net/) was present in the alignment downloaded from RDP. Because the taxon names
exported with this alignment contained special characters that were not compatible with
phylogenetic reconstruction software, a custom script was used to remove or replace
those characters with underscores. A description of and link to this script can be found
in Dunitz et al. ( 2015 ). The alignment was manually examined using MView (http://www.
ebi.ac.uk/Tools/msa/mview/t), the secondary structure was generated using the RNAfold
Web Server (http://rna.tbi.uniVie.ac.at/cgi—bin/RNAfold.cgi) and Visualized with Forna

RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
Morphological, physiological, and biochemical characteristics
Cells were non—motile and not observed to form spores 0r possess ﬂagella, though over
30 ﬂagella 0r ﬂagella—associated genes are present in the genome. In contrast, the genome
for a non—motile close relative (Porphyrobacter cryptus, GenBank: ASM42298V1) does not
contain any ﬂagellar genes so it is possible that strain CoronadoT is motile under speciﬁc
conditions. Unlike most members of the Erythrobacteraceae family, strain CoronadoT is
oxidase—negative. This strain is catalase—positive, and unable to hydrolze casein 0r starch.
Cells were oval 0r rod shaped and ranged in length from 1.2 pun to 2.2 pun with an aver—
age of 1.6 pun (Fig. 1). Cell width ranged from 0.6 pun to 1.0 pun with an average of 0.8 tun.
Growth was only observed under aerobic conditions, from 4 0C to 28 0C, with optimal
growth around 25 °C. N0 growth was observed under microaerophilic conditions (culture
caps closed). Low levels of growth were observed at pH 6.0 up to pH 8.0, maximum growth
occurred around neutral pH. NaCl was required for growth, and the strain could not grow
at > 1.5% NaCl, optimal growth was at 0.5% NaCl. No statistically signiﬁcant difference

Phylogeny and genome analysis

Phylogenetic analysis was performed using the full length (1,482 bp) 16S rDNA
sequence from the genome assembly, not the shorter (1,350 bp) version from Sanger
sequencing. The CoronadoT 16S rDNA sequence showed less than 95.5% identity to other
Porphyrobacter species and identity is even lower to other genera in the family. Given the
low 16S rDNA identity to other members of the family, we did not perform DNA—DNA
hybridization as this would have been uninformative (Stackebrandt e’r Goebel, 1994; Tindall
et al., 2010; Meier-Kolthoﬁ‘et al., 2013).

Phylogenetic trees built by varying the alignment and tree—building algorithms,
number of taxa included, and choice of outgroup demonstrated both that the current
taxonomy of the family is in need of reVision (as has been suggested by others, e.g.,
Rainey et al., 2003; Huang et al., 2015) and that the placement of CoronadoT within the
family is not stable. Because the Bayesian and Maximum Likelihood methods show a very
similar topology, and are considered the most accurate methods for phylogenetic analysis
(e.g., Yang 6’? Rannala, 2012; Kuhner e’r Felsenstein, 1994; Hall, 2005), we have shown those
trees in Figs. 2 and 3. Both of these trees place CoronadoT within the Porphyrobacter clade,
though in the Bayesian tree there is a polytomy at the base of this clade. We note, as also
shown recently by Huang et al. ( 2015 ), that this clade is always polyphyletic with respect to
Erythromicrobium mmosum and often to Erythrobacter litoralis. In addition, CoronadoT is

found on a long branch due to several changes that are unique to this strain, relative to the
rest of the family. These changes are identical in both the assembly and the Sanger sequence
and are all compatible with the secondary structure model of 16S (e.g., changes in a stem
nucleotide pair with the appropriate base). Based on this analysis, we chose to compare
CoronadoT t0 the ﬁve other Porphyrobacter species listed in Table 1.
Analysis of the draft genome of strain CoronadoT was used to complement the physical
characterizations typical of the family Erythrobactemceae and the genus Porphyrobacter.
For example, CoronadoT does not contain any of the numerous genes involved in
bacteriochlorophyll biosynthesis, rendering protein extraction/spectrophotometry
unnecessary. Conversely, while no ﬂagella were observed by TEM, this strain appears to
possess the required genes making it likely that the ﬂagella were lost in sample preparation
or that their expression is condition—dependent.
Polar llpld, respltory llpoqumone, and fatty acud methyl esters
The major cellular fatty acids of strain CoronadoT are C18:1w7cis (56.6%) and C1620
(20.3%). Other fatty acids found in signiﬁcant amounts (>1%) are 2—OH—C14:O (4.8%),
C16:1w5cis (1.1%), C16:1w7cis (9.8%), C17:1w6cis (2%), C18:1w5cis (1.1%), and

C1820 (1.2%). The fatty acid proﬁle of strain CoronadoT ﬁts generally within the ranges
described for members of the most closely related genera (Erythrobacter, Porphyrobacter
and Erythromicrobium, comparison data from Hiraishi et al., 2002). The two exceptions
to this are a slightly higher level of C1420 than average and a much higher level of C1620
than average. However, it is difﬁcult to compare across studies since variation in growth
conditions can signiﬁcantly inﬂuence the fatty acid proﬁle.
The major respiratory quinone is ubiquinone 10 (92%), as it is for all members of the
Erythrobactemceae family. The predominant polar lipid is phosphatidylglycerol, with sig—
niﬁcant amounts of sphingoglycolipid and phosphatidylethanolamine. Smaller amounts
of diphosphatidylglycerol, phosphatidylcholine, and two unidentiﬁed phospholipids were
also observed (Fig. 4).
Concl usuons
Strain CoronadoT clearly falls within the Erythrobactemceae family, based on both
phylogenetic analysis and chemotaxonomic and molecular characteristics (notably fatty
acid proﬁle, carotenoid production, major respiratory quinone, and GC content). Using
Bayesian and Maximum Likelihood phylogenetic reconstruction, the strain falls within a

well—supported (but polyphyletic) Porphyrobacter clade. In addition, CoronadoT shares a
number of characteristics With Porphyrobacter, including the fatty acid proﬁle, polar lipid
composition, catalase activity, etc. The largest differences are the tolerance for growth at
lower temperatures, elevated (316:0, and the lack of bacteriochlorophyll a (for the latter
of Which we have proposed emending the genus description). These characteristics,
in combination With the phylogenetic analysis, lead us to propose that CoronadoT be
classiﬁed as Porphyrobacter mercurialis sp. nov. In the future, the taxonomic status of this
strain may change depending upon availability of clear and distinctive evidence for a new
genus as per polyphasic taxonomic and/or genome sequence based taxonomic approaches.
Emended description of the genus Porphyrobacter Fuerst et al., 1993
The description is identical to that given by Fuerst et al. (1993) With the following
amendments. Most species synthesize BChl a 0n low—nutrient media under aerobic and
semiaerobic conditions. DNA base composition is 63.8—67.3 G—I— C.
