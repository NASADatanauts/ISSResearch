Prostaglandin (PG) D2 is well known as a mediator of inﬂammation. Hematopoietic PGD synthase (HPGDS) is responsible for the
production of PGD2 involved in inﬂammatory responses. Microglial activation and astrogliosis are commonly observed during neuroin-
ﬂammation, including that which occurs during demyelination. Using the genetic demyelination mouse twitcher, a model of human
Krabbe’s disease, we discovered that activated microglia expressed HPGDS and activated astrocytes expressed the DP1 receptor for PGD2
in the brain of these mice. Cultured microglia actively produced PGD2 by the action of HPGDS. Cultured astrocytes expressed two types of
PGD2 receptor, DP1 and DPZ, and showed enhanced GFAP production after stimulation of either receptor with its respective agonist.
These results suggest that PGD2 plays an important role in microglia/astrocyte interaction. We demonstrated that the blockade of the
HPGDS/PGD2 /DP signaling pathway using HPGDS- 0r DPl-null twitcher mice, and twitcher mice treated with an HPGDS inhibitor,
HQL-79 (4—benzhydryloxy-1-[3-(lH-tetrazol-S-yl)-pr0pyl]piperidine), resulted in remarkable suppression of astrogliosis and demyeli-
nation, as well as a reduction in twitching and spasticity. Furthermore, we found that the degree of oligodendroglial apoptosis was also
reduced in HPGDS-null and HQL-79-treated twitcher mice. These results suggest that PGD2 is the key neuroinﬂammatory molecule that
heightens the pathological response to demyelination in twitcher mice.
