Abstract
: The Iow-shear microgravity environment, modeled by rotating suspension culture bioreactors called high aspect
ratio vessels (HARVs), allows investigation in ground-based studies of the effects of microgravity on eukaryotic
cells and provides insights into the impact of space flight on cellular physiology. We have previously demonstrated
that Iow-shear modeled microgravity (LSMMG) causes significant phenotypic changes of a select group of
Saccharomyces cerevisiae genes associated with the establishment of cell polarity, bipolar budding, and cell
separation. However, the mechanisms cells utilize to sense and respond to microgravity and the fundamental gene
expression changes that occur are largely unknown. In this study, we examined the global transcriptional response
of yeast cells grown under LSMMG conditions using DNA microarray analysis in order to determine if exposure
to LSMMG results in changes in gene expression.
Results: LSMMG differentially changed the expression of a significant number of genes (I 372) when yeast cells
were cultured for either five generations or twenty-five generations in HARVs, as compared to cells grown under
identical conditions in normal gravity. We identified genes in cell wall integrity signaling pathways containing MAP
kinase cascades that may provide clues to novel physiological responses of eukaryotic cells to the external stress
of a Iow-shear modeled microgravity environment. A comparison of the microgravity response to other
environmental stress response (ESR) genes showed that 26% of the genes that respond significantly to LSMMG
are involved in a general environmental stress response, while 74% of the genes may represent a unique
transcriptional response to microgravity. In addition, we found changes in genes involved in budding, cell polarity
establishment, and cell separation that validate our hypothesis that phenotypic changes observed in cells grown
in microgravity are reflected in genome-wide changes.
This study documents a considerable response to yeast cell growth in Iow-shear modeled microgravity that is
evident, at least in part, by changes in gene expression. Notably, we identified genes that are involved in cell
signaling pathways that allow cells to detect environmental changes, to respond within the cell, and to change
accordingly, as well as genes of unknown function that may have a unique transcriptional response to microgravity.
We also uncovered significant changes in the expression of many genes involved in cell polarization and bud
formation that correlate well with the phenotypic effects observed in yeast cells when grown under similar
conditions. These results are noteworthy as they have implications for human space flight.
