Abstract

Many types of cells transit in vitro from a two- to a three-dimensional growth, when they are
exposed to microgravity. The underlying mechanisms are not yet understood. Hence, we
investigated the impact of microgravity 011 protein content and growth behavior. For this
purpose the human thyroid cancer cells FTC-133 were seeded either in recently developed
eell containers that can endure enhanced physical forces and perform media changes and cell
harvesting automatically or in T-25 culture ﬂasks. All cells were cultured for 5 days at 1g.
Afterwards, a part of the cell containers were ﬂown to the International Space Station, while
another part was kept on the ground. T-25 ﬂasks were mounted on and next to a Random
Positioning Machine. The cells were cultured for 12 days under the various conditions, before
they were ﬁxed with RNAZater. A11 fixed cultures showed monolayers, but three-dimensional
aggregates were not detected. In a subsequent protein analysis, 180 proteins were identified
by mass spectrometry. These proteins did not indicate significant differences between cells
exposed to microgravity and their 1g controls. However, they suggest that an enhanced
production of proteins related to the extracellular matrix could detain the cells from spheroid
formation, while proﬁlin-l is phosphorylated.

Statement, highlighting the importance and the functional significance of the
research results.

Cell biology in Space needs to send cells into the Earth’s orbit in order to remove gravity
forces almost completely. Transportation of cells into Space is expensive and requires special
containers, Which are very small, light and capable to perform an automatic cell feeding
during the ﬂight. They can harbor only a small number of cells. Therefore, it is desirable to
obtain as much information as possible from each single experiment. In this study, we
demonstrate for the ﬁrst time that our recently developed cell containers, Which
accommodate 13.5 mL cell suspension each, are suitable to culture enough cells in Space for
subsequent meaningful proteome analysis.

The 180 different proteins detected comprise well-known abundant house-keeping proteins,
but also some proteins, Which have not been detected before in comprehensive proteome
analyses of thyroid cancer cells and apparently were up—regulated, When monolayers With
high cell density are exposed to microgravity. They are involved in the formation of the
extracellular matrix and suggest reasons Why three-dimensional spheroid formation does not
occur, When conﬂuent monolayers are exposed to real microgravity in Space. Hence, this
manuscript communicates the importance of cell density for tissue formation under
microgravity.

1 Introduction

Research on numerous types of human cells exposed to weightlessness has been conducted in
recent years [1]. The scientists wanted to understand the health problems, which Space
travelers often face, and aimed also to learn about epigenetie changes and cancer
development [2, 3]. An important aspect of these studies is the comparison of protein
contents of cells grown under normal 1g and of cells exposed to weightlessness [4]. As
Spaceﬂights are rare and extremely expensive, preliminary and accompanying experiments
are often performed on devices such as the Random Positioning Machine (RPM), which
prevent cell sedimentation [5]. We employed devices, which simulate microgravity, to
investigate the impact of microgravity on various human thyroid carcinoma cell lines and
identiﬁed a variety of RPM-indueed cellular changes related to the arrangement of the
cytoskeleton and extracellular matrix (ECM), as well as to altered gene expression, protein
translation and apoptosis [6, 7]. As a byproduct we observed the transition of a great part of
an incubated cell population from a two- to a three-dimensional growth [8]. Speed of
transition and share of transiting eells correlated with distinct proteins expressed in various
types of thyroid cancer cells [9].

Searching for proteins of thyroid cells, we investigated four different cell lines and detected
837 different proteins by several Western blot and mass spectrometry analyses [10, 11]. 326
of those were identical with the proteins of another study on human thyroid cells indicating
862 proteins [12]. Still we do not know, which proteins respond to microgravity conditions
and transduee a signal to the cell interior that triggers the switch of growth behavior [7,11]. In
order to gain more information about the effects of annulling gravity on proteins and growth
behavior, we decided to validate the RPM experiments by analyzing proteins of cells ﬂown in

the Earth’s orbit. After suitable cell culture equipment and supplies as well as small,
automated experimental containers had been designed and constructed, a successful ﬂight
experiment (Shenzhou-8 Spaceﬂight) was performed, which revealed a seaffold-free
formation of extraordinary large three-dimensional aggregates and an altered expression of a
number of genes [13].

Here we describe a second Spaceﬂight experiment with FTC-133 cells [14] performed in
April/May 2014. At the start of this experiment the rocket’s launch was delayed. This
situation enforced that the cell lawn was rather dense at the time of lift-off. The cells
survived. A conﬂuent cell monolayer was ﬁxed by RNAZater at the end of the experiment.
180 proteins were identiﬁed in cells harvested from RNAZater-fixed monolayers.

2 Material and Methods

2.1 Cell cultures

The human follicular thyroid carcinoma cell line FTC-133 [14] was purchased from Health
Protection Agency Culture Collections (HPACC; Salixbury, UK) and cultured in RPMI 1640
medium (Invitrogen, Eggenstein, Germany) supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum (FCS;
Bioehrom, Berlin, Germany), penicillin (100 U/ml), and streptomycin (100 ug/ml; Bioehrom)
at 370C and 5% C02 until use for the experiments. Immediately before ﬁlling the automated
cell culture systems for the ﬂight or T-25 culture ﬂasks for the RPM, the cells were
suspended in fresh culture medium and diluted appropriately.

2.2 CellBox Spaceﬂight experiment

The cells were sent to the International Space Station (188) by a Falcon 9 rocket on the
SPACEX CRS-3 Mission. For this endeavor, human thyroid cancer cells were incubated in a
hardware ﬂight module (FM; supplementary Fig. 1), which was similar to that ﬂown in the
SimBox project 2011 on Shenzhou—8 [13]. The rocket launched on the 04/18/2014
(http://www.dlr.de/dlr/desktopdefault.asp_x/tabid- 103 3 7/1343_read- 1063 9/ #/ gallery/ 15 163).
The reentry vehicle landed on 05/20/2014 in the paciﬁc. Preparation and treatment of the
cells were performed as shown in Fig. 1. Five days before the launch, 9 newly developed eell
containers (FM) with a cell chamber volume of 13.5 mL [13] were each ﬁlled with a cell
suspension containing 1x106 FTC-133 thyroid cancer cells and incubated as indicated in Fig.
1. As the launch was delayed for three days, the cells were fed exchanging the medium after
three days of incubation i.e. two days before the actual launch. 24 hours before the start, the
cell containers were put in metal bushes. Three of these bushes were stored in a special room
at 23°C. These ﬂight modules remaining on the ground are called GFM. Another 6 containers
were wrapped in air cushions and loaded in the rocket for the transport to the 188, where the
temperature was kept at 23°C. The other ﬂight modules ﬂown to the 188 are called FFM.
Two days after the launch, the rocket docked to the ISS and the cells were loaded in the 188.
On the 188 cells were stored at 23°C continuously, while G-foree values oscillated between i
0.005g. After another 10 days, i.e. after 12 days of microgravity, the medium was removed
from the FM eell container and RNAZater ﬁxation was performed automatically [13], while
the GFMs were treated in the same way simultaneously. Feeding and ﬁxation were performed
automatically. In each case, pumps operated for 5 minutes. Two small tanks incorporated in
each FM contained either fresh medium or RNAZater ﬂuid (Supplementary Fig. 1). Both
tanks were divided by a ﬂexible separator into full and empty tank compartments. For
feeding e.g., fresh medium was pumped from tank 1 into the cultivation chamber on one side.

The incoming ﬂuid pressed the liquid from inside the cultivation chamber into the empty
compartment of tank 1. The same procedure went on during RNAZater ﬁxation using tank 2
(for further details see [13]). Two days after ﬁxation three FFMs as well as the three GFMs
were cooled down to 4°C. At this temperature of 4°C the FFMs were brought back to the
laboratory, and cells from three FFMs and three GFMs were harvested.

2.3 Random positioning machine (RPM)

Control experiments on the ground were performed using a new RPM constructed by the
DLR (Cologne, Germany) and re-modeled at Aarhus University (Denmark). On this machine
we carried out experiments according to the same protocol and timeline as during the
SPACEX CRS-3 Mission (see Fig. 1). The only difference to the in—ﬂight samples was that
the cells were cultivated in 15 T-25 ﬂasks mounted on the RPM, while another 15 were
located next to the RPM. A11 ﬂasks on the RPM were kept at 23°C without C02 for 12 days
and then ﬁxed with RNAlater.

2.4 Protein preparation

RNAZater-ﬁxed cells harvested from two FFM and three GFM eell chambers were
solubilized by using AllPrep purchased from Qiagen (Hilden, Germany). Samples containing
100 pg of total protein were diluted 10-fold with iee-eold ethanol and stored at -40°C for 1 h.
Then they were eentriﬁaged at 4°C at 25,000g for 30 min. The supernatant was carefully
removed and protein pellets were washed once in iee-eold acetone and then resolubilized in 2
M guanidin hydroehlorid (GuHCl; Appliehem, Darmstadt, Germany), 25 mM
tetraethylammonium bromide (TEAB; Merck, Darmstadt, Germany), pH 7.8. The protein
solution was further diluted 10-fold with 50 mM NH4HC03, 5% ACN (Merck), and 1 mM
CaC12. For proteolytie digestion, T-426 trypsin (Sigma Aldrich, Steinheim, Germany) was

added in a 1:20 (w/w) ratio and samples were incubated for 15 h at 37°C. Generated peptides
were desalted using C18 solid-phase tips (SPEC C18 AR, 4 mg bed, Agilent Technologies,
Béblingen, Germany) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Eluted peptides were
concentrated under vacuum and reﬁlled to a peptide concentration of 111 g/ ML.

2.5 Mass spectrometry

For LC-MS analysis, the C18 eluates resuspended in 0.1% TFA (Merck) were analyzed by
nano-LC-MS/MS using a Velos mass spectrometer (Thermo Scientiﬁc, Dreieieh, Germany)
online coupled to a name RSLC HPLC system (Thermo Scientiﬁc) according to a protocol
described in [15]. Samples were loaded onto a trap column (C18, 200 um X 5 cm PepMap
RSLC, Thermo Scientiﬁc) at a ﬂow rate of 20 ttL/min 0.1% TFA and subsequently separated
on a 50 em main column (C18, 200 um X 50 em PepMap RSLC, Thermo Scientiﬁc) using a
binary gradient consisting of solvent A (0.1% TFA) and solvent B (0.08% TFA, 94% ACN)
at a ﬂow rate of 250 nL/min and 60 OC. Gradients increased linearly from 3 to 42% B in 140
min. The Velos was operated in data-dependent acquisition mode acquiring ﬁall MS Sean at
R=70,000, followed by MS/MS 0f the 15 most abundant ions (T0p15) at R=17,500. Target
values and ﬁll times were set to 3 X106 and 120 ms for MS and 5 X 104 and 250 ms for
MS/MS, respectively. Charge states +2 to +5 were selected for fragmentation with a
normalized collision energy of 35. Raw data were searched with the Proteome Discoverer
Software 1.3 (Thermo Scientiﬁc) and Mascot 2.2 (MatriX Science, London, UK) against
Uniprot human databases [16]. Search settings were as follows: (i) Trypsin as enzyme with a
maXimum of two missed cleavage sites, (ii) earbamidomethylation 0f Cys as ﬁXed
modiﬁcation, (iii) 0Xidati0n 0f Met as variable modiﬁcations, (iv) MS and MS/MS tolerances
of 10 ppm and 0.5 Da, respectively. Only proteins with at least two peptides having (i) a mass
deviation of 4 ppm and (iii) between 6 and 22 amino acids, were considered for data

evaluation

2.6 Western blot analysis

Cells harvested from RPM cultures and their controls were solubilized using the AllPrep kit
from Qiagen (Hilden, Germany) and subjected to SDS-PAGE. Subsequent immunoblotting
and densitometry were carried out following routine protocols [17]. Antibodies were applied
at appropriate dilutions to quantify CD44 (dilution: 1:1000; New England Biolabs, Hitchin,
England), Serpin H1 (dilution: 1:500; Sigma-Aldrich), Proﬁlin-l (dilution: 1:1000; Biotrend,
C010 gne, Germany).

2.7 STRING analysis

Interactions between proteins were determined using the STRING platform [18]. For each
protein, the UniProtKB entry number was inserted in the input form “multiple proteins” and
“Homo sapiens” was selected as organism. The resulting network View was downloaded in
the conﬁdence View showing lines between interacting proteins [11].

2.8 Statistics

The statistical analyses of the densitometric results of the Western blots were performed
using SPSS 16.0 software (SPSS, 1110., Chicago, IL, USA). We used either 1-way ANOVA or
the Mann—Whitney U test. Differences were considered significant at the level of P < 0.05.
All data are presented as means i SD.

3 Results and Discussion

3.1 Continuous two-dimensional growth of cells under microgravity

Samples returned from the ISS and ground-based control samples were examined Visually.
To our surprise we could not detect any macroscopic differences between in—ﬂight and
ground- control cultures. Both, the GFMs and FFMs contained only FTC-133 eells growing
as monolayer cultures (Fig. 2A,B). Interestingly, multioellular spheroids, which were seen in
all preceding RPM and 2D-elinostat experiments and after the Shenzhou—8 mission [1, 13],
could not be found in FFMs. This unexpected result challenged us to hypothesize that the
prolonged pre-ineubation time could be a reason why spheroid formation failed in the
CellBoX Spaceﬂight although it happened during the SimBoX Spaceﬂight earlier, when equal
types of cells were cultured in equal hardware. Therefore, we suspended 1X106 FTC-133 cells
in T-25 and incubated them ﬁrst at 1g for 2 days, as we did prior to the SimBoX Spaceﬂight.
Then we exposed them the culture ﬂasks for another 5 days to the RPM. These cells formed
spheroids after 5 days on the RPM (Fig. 2C), but not in the controls positioned next to the
RPM (Fig. 2D). For comparison purposes we suspended 1X106 FTC-133 cells in T-25, but
pre-ineubated them at 1g for 5 days until they reached conﬂuence. Subsequently 50% of the
ﬂasks were mounted on the RPM, while the other 50% were cultured at 1g next to the RPM
(controls). After another 12 days, we found only monolayers like shown in Fig. 2B also in T-
25 culture ﬂasks. The results strengthened our hypothesis that a prolonged pre-ineubation of
thyroid cells prevents subsequent spheroid formation under microgravity. At the moment we
do not know whether the observation is due only to a high cell density or also to cell
components, which are up—or down—regulated in CGTH W-l or FTC-133 thyroid cells during
prolonged incubation on ground [19, 20]. In any case the observation is of extreme interest,

because it shows possibilities to modify the effects of microgravity and may also explain why
the formation of tubes surrounded by a single cell wall is delayed [21].

3.2 Identiﬁcation of proteins in RNAlater-ﬁxed cells by mass spectrometry

After harvest, RNAZater-fixed cells, which had been cultured in FFMs or GFMs like shown
in Fig. 2A, were lysed. Subsequently, their proteome was analyzed by mass spectrometry.
The analyses revealed 140, 126, and 138 different proteins in the three GFMS, respectively.
In two FFMs we found 132 and 53 proteins. Removing duplicates or triplicates resulted in
167 different proteins from control cells of GFMS and 133 different proteins from ﬂown cells
of FMS. 120 proteins of ﬂown and control cells were identical, but 47 proteins from the
ground control cells and 13 from the ﬂown cells were unique, respectively. The different
numbers of proteins detectable in FFM and GFM samples appeared to be due to statistical
reasons, because they belonged to the group of proteins of which few peptides were
identiﬁed. Furthermore, when we performed Western blot analyses of serpin H-1 (Fig. 3A),
CD44 (Fig. 3B) and proﬁlin (Fig. 3C), which were detected by MS in FFM cells only, we
found similar concentrations of these proteins independently whether the cells had been
exposed to microgravity or kept under normal gravity. Interestingly, Western blot analysis of
proﬁlin-l with an antibody directed against the amino aeid-sequenee 126-137 showed weaker
strengths of gel bands, when the protein had been isolated from the cells exposed to
microgravity (Fig. 3D). Proﬁlins are small aetin binding proteins that regulate aetin
polymerization [22]. Their activities are regulated by phosphorylation and de-
phosphorylation [23]. Therefore, the ﬁner band in Fig. 3D could point to proﬁlin
phosphorylation. As recent research showed that phosphorylation of proﬁlin-l has inﬂuence
on cell migration [24], a future conﬁrmation of the observation appears important.

3.3 Analysis of the identiﬁed proteins

Assuming that the differences of protein expression between cells harvested from GFMs and
FFMs as detected by the proteome analysis were not signiﬁcant, we focused our evaluation
on all 180 different proteins (see supplementary Table 1) found within the samples of
RNAZater-ﬁxed cells. They comprise about 2% 0f the types of proteins, which are normally
expressed in a living cell [25]. Hence it may be assumed that mainly abundant proteins were
detected in the RNAZater-ﬁxed cells [26]. In order to see which proteins became detectable in
the samples of the Spaceﬂight project described, but had not been detected in our earlier
protecme studies revealing 837 proteins expressed by thyroid cells, we compared the new list
of proteins with the older one. 109 proteins found in this new study had already been detected
in the earlier experiments (i.e. 61%). They mainly comprised housekeeping proteins such as
enzymes of glycolysis, cytoskeletal proteins and heat shock proteins [11]. But 71 proteins, i.e.
39% 0f the proteins found in RNAZater-ﬁxed cells of both the FFM and GFM cell incubators
had not been seen in our former thyroid protein analysis. Amongst other proteins, the 71
types of proteins included a number of plasma proteins, which normally are found in the
blood and are involved in blood coagulation.

There is another comprehensive protecme study described in the literature [12]. It indicated
862 types of proteins expressed in various thyroid cell lines. We compared the 71 protein
mentioned above with those found in the analysis described by Arcansis et a1. [12]. After this
second comparison 29 proteins remained which emerged in the described analysis but were
not detected in the two other ones, which had been performed on freshly harvested cells.
Twelve of these proteins show interaction (Fig. 4). They included three types of inter alpha
inhibitors heavy chains (Fig. 4), which are normally found in plasma and urine and interact
with the matrix protein hyaluronan [27]. Their expression is ﬁequently lost, when thyroid

cells become malignant [28]. In addition three coagulation factors showed up. They are
involved in blood clotting [29] and are regulated by thyroid hormones [30]. But also the
fibrinolytie components plasminogen and tetraneetin were found. Tetraneetin is produced in
the thyroid gland [31] and released into the plasma, where it binds and activates plasminogen
0r apolipoprotein [32]. Its capability to enhance proteolytie activities in tissues favors
metastasis of various types of cancer cells [33]. Thrombospondin 4 is mainly expressed by
neurons and forms a component of the matrix at neuromuscular junctions [34]. Information
about its possible role in a normal thyroid gland could not be found. Whether or not there is
competition with thrombospondin 1 for CD36, highly expressed in the FTC-133 cells,
remains to be determined [35]. The cartilage oligomerie matrix protein may further enhance
the cells’ resistance against apoptosis [13, 36]. It may be up-regulated together with CD36 as
described for the cells of the human endometrium [37]. Taken together the interacting
proteins shown in Fig. 4 appear to favor an enhanced ECM turnover, which could cause a
firm anchoring 0f the cells within the ECM and hinders spheroid formation. These proteins
were not found before in thyroid cultures forming spheroids, not even when we analyzed the
proteins of ML-l thyroid cells cultured for 7 and 11 days 011 the RPM [38]. Thus their
appearance could be linked to the cell behavior indicated in Fig. 2.

4 Conclusions

Within five days after seeding, the FTC-133 cells form conﬂuent monolayers (Fig. 1). If
conﬂuent and sub-eonﬂuent monolayers are cultured on the RPM, only the sub-eonﬂuent
monolayers form spheroids (Fig. 2). Hence, the unexpected result that the FTC-133 thyroid
cancer cells did not form spheroids during their ﬂight to and stay on the 188 was very likely
due to the delay of the launch, whieh enforced a prolonged pre-ineubation 0f the cells. The
cells, which grew in monolayers whose high cell density prevented spheroid formation during
Spaceﬂight, enhanced their content of proteins, which are involved in regulation and

composition of the extracellular matrix (Fig. 4). Therefore, it appears likely that a ﬁrm
anchorage 0f FTC-133 cells to ECM proteins of a conﬂuent cell monolayer could prevent
spheroid formation and is accompanied by phosphorylation of proﬁlin-l (Fig. 3). Future
comparative studies on FTC-133 cancer cells, Which do [13, 20] or do not (Fig. 2) form
spheroids When exposed to microgravity, may help to identify these proteins that trigger
cellular alterations under microgravity.
