BACKGROUND: It is currently unknown whether immune system alterations persist during Iong-duration spaceﬂight. In

this study various adaptive immune parameters were assessed in astronauts at three intervals during 6—month spaceﬂight on board

the International Space Station (ISS).

AIMS: To assess phenotypic and functional immune system alterations in astronauts participating in 6-month orbital spaceﬂight.

METHODS: Blood was collected before, during, and after ﬂight from 23 astronauts participating in 6-month ISS expeditions.

|n—ﬂight samples were returned to Earth within 48 h of collection for immediate analysis. Assays included peripheral leukocyte

distribution, T—cell function, virus-speciﬁc immunity, and mitogen—stimulated cytokine production proﬁles.

RESULTS: Redistribution of leukocyte subsets occurred during ﬂight, including an elevated white blood cell (WBC) count and

alterations in CD8+ T-cell maturation. A reduction in general T-cell function (both CD4+ and CD8+) persisted for the duration of the

6-month spaceﬂights, with differential responses between mitogens suggesting an activation threshold shift. The percentage of

CD4+ T cells capable of producing |L—2 was depressed after landing. Signiﬁcant reductions in mitogen—stimulated production of

IFNy, |L—10, |L—5, TNFa, and |L—6 persisted during spaceﬂight. Following lipopolysaccharide (LPS) stimulation, production of |L-10 was

reduced, whereas |L-8 production was increased during ﬂight.

CONCLUSIONS: The data indicated that immune alterations persist during Iong-duration spaceﬂight. This phenomenon,

in the absence of appropriate countermeasures, has the potential to increase speciﬁc clinical risks for crewmembers during

exploration-class deep space missions.
