Abstract
A microgravity protein crystallization experiment is described in Which the existence of a supersaturation wave
traveling across a diffusion-reaction system is experimentally demonstrated for the ﬁrst time. The self—organized
dynamics of the experimental setup were used to implement a crystallization technique able to search automatically
through the crystallization parameter space for optimum nucleation and growth conditions. The crystals obtained by
this automatic optimization produced the highest quality X-ray diffraction data ever collected from the model protein
used in the experiment. © 2001 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.
