aThe flux is in units of 10—11 ergs CIn_2 s_1 in the 4—10 keV band, converted from Crab units; 1 Crab 2 1.21><10—8 ergs CIn_2 s_l.

bSy: Seyfert galaxy, LMXB: low-mass X-ray binary, HMXB: high-mass X-ray binary, Symb: symbiotic star, NS: neutron star, BHC: black hole candidate, CV: cataclysmic variable, ULX: ultra-luminous
X-ray source, msPSR: millisecond pulsar.

CThe redshifts are taken from the online database SIMBAD and NED. A blank indicates the source is Galactic, and — indicates the source has 1’10 redshift information.

d(A) Identified by individual inspection since in the image fitting the position is unable to be determined due to significant source confusion with Perseus Cluster. (B) The data is extended compared
with the PSF model. (C) Matsumura et a1.(2011) (D)Suzuki et a1.(2010) (E) Isobe et a1.(2010) (F) This source is likely to be contaminated by 1RXS J133344.4—231734 and TV Hya. ESO 509-IG66 has
double nuclei with similar fluxes in the 2—10 keV band (Guainazzi et a1. 2005). The redshift is adopted from Sekiguchi & Wolstencroft (1992). (G) This source is possibly contaminated by V893 Sco
and other nearby sources.
