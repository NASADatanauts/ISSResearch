ABSTRACT
The balloon—borne Cosmic Ray Energetics And Mass experiment launched ﬁve times from Antarctica has achieved
a cumulative ﬂight duration of about 156 days above 99.5% of the atmosphere. The instrument is conﬁgured with
complementary and redundant particle detectors designed to extend direct measurements of cosmiC—ray composition
to the highest energies practical with balloon ﬂights. All elements from protons to iron nuclei are separated with
excellent Charge resolution. Here, we report results from the ﬁrst two ﬂights of ~70 days, which indicate hardening
of the elemental spectra above ~200 GeV/nucleon and a spectral difference between the two most abundant
species, protons and helium nuclei. These results Challenge the View that cosmiC—ray spectra are simple power laws
below the so—called knee at ~1015 eV. This discrepant hardening may result from a relatively nearby source, or it
could represent spectral concavity caused by interactions of cosmic rays with the accelerating shock. Other possible
explanations should also be investigated.

include a Timing Charge Detector (TCD), a Transition Radia—

of a Silicon Charge Detector (SCD), carbon targets, scintillating
ﬁber hodosopes (80/81 and S2), and an ionization calorimeter
