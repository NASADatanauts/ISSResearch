1. Introduction
PDB Reference: triosephosphate isomerase, Accurate and reliable protein structures are of signiﬁcance and help
1Wyi, rlwyisf- in the understanding of biological reactions and in structure-based
rational drug design. The quality of crystals is the most important key
factor in acquiring a high-resolution structure. Therefore, a number
of methods to improve the quality of protein crystals during the
course of crystal growth are being developed. For example, methods
to increase the stability of the crystal-growth environment include
growth in a high magnetic ﬁeld (Kinoshita et aL, 2003), growth in the
presence of cross-linking agents (Pakhomova et al., 2000), growth in
gels (Cudney et al., 1994; Garcia-Ruiz & Moreno, 1994; Zhu et al.,
2001) and growth in microgravity (Borgstahl et aL, 2001; Vergara et
al., 2003; Miele et al., 2003).
Crystals of human triosephosphate isomerase (TIM; EC 5.3.1.1)
with two crystal morphologies were obtained using the normal
vapour-diffusion technique with identical crystallization conditions.
One had a disordered plate shape and the crystals were hollow
(crystal form 1; Fig. 1a) and were very fragile. The crystals diffracted
to 2.8 A resolution and had similar crystallographic parameters to
those of the structure 1hti in the Protein Data Bank (Table 1; Mande
et al., 1994). The crystals were suitable for structure analysis, but it
was difﬁcult to grow crystals suitable for high-resolution data
collection. Agarose gel combined with the vapour-diffusion method
gave slightly larger crystals, but did not improve the crystal quality.
