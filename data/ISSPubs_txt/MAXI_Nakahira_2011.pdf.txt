I Q Abstract
: 2 We report on the X-ray spectral analysis of the black hole candidate XTE J1752—223 in the 2009—2010 outburst,
: —4 utilizing data obtained With the MAXI/Gas Slit Camera (GSC), the Swift/XRT, and Suzaku, Which work comple-
. . . . mentarily. As already reported by Nakahira et a1. (2010) MAXI monitored the source continuously throughout the
- . Z - entire outburst for about eight months. All the MAXI/GSC energy spectra in the high/soft state lasting for 2 months
I >< are well represented by a multi-color disk plus power-law model. The innermost disk temperature changed from
- $—4 - ~0.7 keV to ~04 keV and the disk ﬂux decreased by an order of magnitude. Nevertheless, the innermost radius
I F3 I is constant at ~41 D3,5(cos z')_% km, Where D35 is the source distance in units of 3.5 kpc and 73 the inclination.
The multi-color disk parameters obtained With the MAXI/GSC are consistent With those With the Swift/XRT and
Suzaku. The Suzaku data also suggests a possibility that the disk emission is slightly Comptonized, Which could
account for broad iron-K features reported previously. Assuming that the obtained innermost radius represents the
innermost stable circular orbit for a non-rotating black hole, we estimate the mass of the black hole to be 5.51i0.28
M (9 D35 (cos i)‘ % , Where the correction for the stress-free inner boundary condition and color hardening factor of
1.7 are taken into account. If the inclination is less than 490 as suggested from the radio monitoring of transient jets
and the soft-to-hard transition in 2010 April occurred at 1—4% of Eddignton luminosity, the ﬁtting of the Suzaku
spectra With a relativistic accretion-disk model derives constraints on the mass and the distance to be 3.1—55 MG
and 2.3—22 kpc, respectively. This conﬁrms that the compact object in XTE J1752—223 is a black hole.
Key words: accretion disks — black hole physics — stars: individual (XTE J1752—223) — X-rays: stars

were tuned so that the results of the spectral ﬁt to an absorbed
