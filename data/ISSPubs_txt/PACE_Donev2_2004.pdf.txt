In this Letter, we report on the densest-known packings of congruent ellipsoids. The family of new
packings consists of crystal arrangements of spheroids With a Wide range of aspect ratios, and With
density g0 always surpassing that of the densest Bravais lattice packing g0 % 0.7405. A remarkable
maximum density of gb % 0.7707 is achieved for maximal aspect ratios larger than J8, When each
ellipsoid has 14 touching neighbors. Our results are directly relevant to understanding the equilibrium
behavior of systems of hard ellipsoids, and, in particular, the solid and glassy phases.

ellipsoids? Our initial attempts to answer this question
using global optimization have not found such a crystal
packing, but have not ruled out the possibility either.
Further multidisciplinary investigations are needed to
answer this and related questions. The results of such
investigations could be used to formulate a Kepler—like
conjecture for ellipsoids and understand the high—density
phase behavior of the hard—ellipsoid system.
