Abstract
The dose values in body’s critical organs are necessary for estimating the effective dose. The tissue-equivalent phantom is
used for such assessment as a rule. The spherical phantom is best ﬁt for this goal. Therefore, the method developed on the
basis of such phantom application becomes a good mean of effective dose estimating onboard the International Space Station.
The main problems connected With developing a method of assessing an effective dose in the human’s body organs With usage
of a spherical phantom are presented in the paper. Proposed method can be used for monitoring the daily effective dose of
crewmembers exposure for undisturbed radiation conditions of the ﬂight.
