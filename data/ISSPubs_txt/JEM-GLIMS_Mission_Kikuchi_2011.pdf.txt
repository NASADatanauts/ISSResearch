A project to observe lightning and sprites from the International Space Station (ISS), with altitude 0f407 km and inclination of
51.6°, is planned for 2012. GLIMS (global lightning and sprite measurements) is an instrument designed for this project, and it
includes a CMOS camera, photomultipliers, a VLF receiver, and a VHF interferometer. This is the ﬁrst project for simultaneous
measurements of lightning, sprites, and radiowaves from lightning simultaneously. The sensors used for GLIMS were developed
based on previous satellite projects. However, for this project, the sensors used needed to be synchronized, and controlled through

the Japanese experiment module (IBM) interface. A science data-handling unit (SHU) was newly developed for this purpose; it
included a function for suppressing data trafﬁc using a highuspeed lossless compression code (HIREW).
