Abstract
All human space missions, regardless of destination, require signiﬁcant logistical mass and volume.
The amount required is a function of the mission duration. Reducing this logistical mass and
volume by reusing items that would otherwise become trash can reduce launch weight and
consequently mission costs. This paper describes a logistics reduction technology based on
repurposing International Space Station (ISS) Crew Transfer Bags (CTB).
CTBs are fabric cargo containers, Which conform to speciﬁc dimensional and material requirements
for space ﬂight. This paper describes the development of a Forward Osmosis Cargo Transfer Bag
(FO-CTB) that can be reused 0n orbit to provide radiation sheading and water recycling capacity.
The design, construction and testing of a prototype FO-CTB at the Desert Research and Technology
Studies (D-Rats) Habitat Demonstration Unit (HDU) in 2011 is described. In addition, a summary of
the results of a ﬂight experiment performed to evaluate the effect of microgravity 0n the forward
osmosis (F0) membrane bags used in the FO-CTB is also discussed. Future plans for the continued
development of the FO-CTB are also discussed.

Introduction
This paper describes a Logistic to Living (L2L) evaluation for repurposing or converting space ﬂight
logistical items into useful crew items after they have completed their primary logistics function. The
intent is that by repurposing items, additional items do not have to be launched and overall launch mass
will be decreased. L2L will enable payloads to be used more effectively through reuse and rearrangement
of logistical components.

The L2L concept discussed in this paper is based on cargo transfer bags (CTBs) which are currently
used to transfer cargo to the 188. For a 6—month mission, a crew of four typically uses hundreds of CTBs.
These CTBs are used for on—orbit transfer and storage but eventually becomes trash after use. This paper
discusses the reuse of the CTBs to provide multiple functions such as radiation protection, life support
capacity, and structural elements in addition to their primary use as cargo transfer bags.

The LTL concept redesigns CTBs to enable disassembly on—orbit (unfolding). The deconstructed
CTBs are then ﬁlled with water and reused for radiation shielding and life support functions. These CTBs
are modiﬁed to include a inner bladder that allows them to be ﬁlled with water. The CTB can then be used
as a radiation protection water wall. In addition, if the CTB bladder is composed of a forward osmosis
(FO) membrane the CTBs can then be used to recycle wastewater.

A prototype FO—CTB was tested this August 2011 in the D—Rats HDU ﬁeld demonstration project. This
testing demonstrated FO water recycling bags integrated into a CTB simulator. The primary objectives of
this testing was to construct the CTB, integrate it within the HDU, and demonstrate basic function as a
water treatment system. Testing was composed of processing simulated wastewater.

A ﬂight—test of a stand—alone FO bag, the functional element of the FO—CTB, was completed as a sortie
payload Shuttle Mission, STS—l35 in early July 2011. This mission tested a ﬂight qualiﬁed version of the
FO bags used in the FO—CTB. The primary objective of this test was to demonstrate that FO functions as
expected in microgravity. The ﬂight version of the bag is called the Forward Osmosis Bag (FOB).

The main goal of the FOB ﬂight experiment was to investigate the forward osmosis membrane in
spaceﬂight environment and compare its performance against ground reference controls. The ﬂight
evaluated the ﬂux of water across the forward osmosis membrane in reduced gravity using a combination
of indicator dyes. Samples were collected and speciﬁc ion analysis was conducted to determine ion
rejections. An evaluation of the effects of mechanical mixing upon the ﬂux rate was also completed. A
summary of these results is provided in this paper.

Background

The FO—CTB is based on a technique called forward osmosis (F0). F0 is a process where the osmotic
potential between two ﬂuids of differing solute/solvent concentrations equalize by the movement of solvent
from the less concentrated solution to the more concentrated solution [1—4]. This is typically accomplished
through the use of a semi—permeable membrane that separates the two solutions.

In wastewater treatment applications where the solvent is usually water and the solutes are the
contaminants, the semi—permeable membrane allows the ﬂux of water across the membrane but rejects
contaminates. In such a system the wastewater, or feed, is passed on one side of the membrane and an
osmotic agent (OA), such as salt water, is passed on the other. The DA can use any solute as long as it can
produce an osmotic pressure that is higher than that of the feed and the solute used is well rejected by the
membrane.

The performance of F0 as a water puriﬁcation deVice along with other applications has been
evaluated by many [5—16]. NASA has also tested F0 for the treatment of space craft wastewater [5—9 &17—
25]. NASA has a patent for the treatment of urine using a combined FO membrane bag with a granular
activated charcoal (GAC) ﬁlter to pretreat the urine prior to introducing it into the FOB[18 & 26] . NASA
has also used the FO principle in the Direct Osmotic Concentration (DOC) technology [5—8 & 23—25] and is
currently developing it as a post treatment system through the Next Generation Life Support [NGLS]
project. This OCT funded program is developing a version of it called the Forward Osmosis Secondary
Treatment (FOST) system. NASA also has evaluated the us of the FO bag and for desalination during
space craft water landings [20].

The F0 bag used in the FO—CTB is based on the Hydration Technology Innovations (HTI) product
called the X—PackTM. NASA has completed extensive testing of the X—PackTM[17—18, 20—22, & 27] This
testing has shown that the X—PackTM in combination with granular activated charcoal (GAC) is capable of
rejecting 2 90 % of the salts, 2 85 % of the Total Oxidizable Carbon ( TOC ), 2 95 % of the Total Nitrogen
( TN ), and 2 93 % of Urea — Nitrogen ( BUN ) in urine while completely removing a mixed bacterial
population of > 108 cells per milliliter of raw liquid. The X—Pack yields 2 0.9 L of liquid product from 1.0
L of raw water in 4—6 hours at 25°C. The membrane has a microbial disinfection capability of > 6 — log
units ( i.e. ,removing 99.9999 % of a bacterial population from raw water) and reduces the concentration of
many commonly found environmental contaminants.

HDU Testing

A demonstration of a FO—CTB was completed at the August 2011 D—Rats HDU ﬁeld demonstration
project. The objective of this demonstration was to construct a FO—CTB bag that could be ﬁlled, drained,
and would demonstrate its function as radiation protection and water recycling.

Methods

The FO—CTB was constructed from modiﬁed X—PackTM like bags placed in pockets of a simulated
cargo transfer bag constructed of canvas. The FO—CTB is shown in Figure 1 folded up in its cargo
carrying form. It is a speciﬁed size, in this case 42.5 cm (16.75 inches) by 50 cm (19.75 inches) by 25
cm (9.75 inches). The size is derived from the current standard CTB size for the International Space
Station.

The FO—CTB is designed to function like a standard CTB. It is folded into a rectangle and used to
haul cargo. However, once the cargo is removed from the FO—CTB and the bag is unfolded it can be
reused as a radiation protection water wall and for water puriﬁcation. The unfolded FO—CTB is shown
in Figures 2 and 3. Figure 3 shows unfolded bag with a FO bag plumbing array suspended in front of
the CTB in the approximate location of the internal bags. The unfolding exposes input and output
quick disconnect 1A” nipples servicing both the reject and permeate (product) side of the water
treatment membranes in the lining of the CTB. The internal plumbing of the FO bags is shown in
Figure 4. Figure 5 shows an indiVidual FO bag used in the FO—CTB.

HDU Results

The placement of the FO-CTBs inside the HDU is shown in Figures 6 and 7. The FO-CTB was
installed in the hygiene module behind a cabinet as shown in Figure 6. This Figure shows the FO-CTB
is ideally suited for placement in the HDU structure. Figure 7 shows the detail of how it was attached
to the inner support structure of the HDU. Also shown are the feed and product connectors. The
ability to install the FO-CTB against the inner wall of the HDU demonstrates its use as internal
radiation sheading.

The use of the CTB bags as radiation shielding was also demonstrated by installing them external
to the HDU module. This is shown in Figure 8. In this approach the CTB placed on the external
surface of the vehicle or habitat.

The second FO-CTB was tested externally t0 the HDU to demonstrate the ability ﬁll, drain, and
treat simulated wastewater. This FO-CTB was composed of a three-bag element (2 L each) as shown
in Figure 4. This FO-CTB was tested using an NaCl salt water draw solution and a standard blue food
coloring dye as simulated wastewater. This was a qualitative performance test designed to mirror the
operational ""in ﬁeld"" operational testing of the system.

During these tests 6 L of simulated wastewater was feed into the FO-CTB . Approximately 5.4 L
of product was generated. The osmotic draw solution used was a 32 g/L NaCl solution and the product
was the diluted osmotic draw solution. The effectiveness of the water treatment was evaluated by
observing that no dye passed from the feed to the product. No chemical or biological analysis was
performed.

Flight Testing
Microgravity ﬂight testing was completed in 2011 onboard the STS-l35 Atlantis Space Shuttle
mission. The objectives of this ﬂight experiment was to evaluate the performance of F0 bags used in the
FO-CTB in microgravity. It also veriﬁed procedures for ﬁlling and draining the bags, the effects of
concentration polarization, and membrane wetting characteristics in microgravity [3 O].

Methods
A custom forward osmosis bag based on the design of the Hydration Technologies Innovation
(HTI) X-PackTM was developed for this application. This Forward Osmosis Bag (FOB) was fabricated
by HTI under contract from Kennedy Space Center (KSC). It was modiﬁed from the X-PackTM to
have two quick disconnect connections to add and remove ﬂuids in microgravity and the materials of
construction were changed to a safety approved space ﬂight qualiﬁed plastic. The original X-Pack
outer shell is made out of polyvinyl chloride, whereas the FOB outer shell was fabricated out of
polyethylene. Figures 9 and 10 show the commercially available X-Pack and the NASA ﬂight FOB
bag. Bags are dimensionally the same, approximately 12 inches by 7 inches.

The experiment occurred onboard the space shuttle (STS 135) after undocking from the
International Space Station. A shuttle crewmember injected a preloaded mixture of a lower
concentration liquid consisting of a 550ml potassium chloride solution with methyl blue dye into the
outer chamber of the FOB. This dye containing mixture represented the ""dirty"" water. A higher
concentrated ""draw"" solution, containing a 60 m1 sugar solution with ﬂuorescein dye, was then injected
into the bags inner chamber. A total of siX bags were tested. Three were left undisturbed during the
experiment while the crewmember hand kneaded the remaining three bags at the start of the
experiment to assist in the mixing of the ﬂuids. Figure 9 shows the components used in the ﬁlling and
draining procedure. Figure 10 shows the complete assembly on orbit.

After siX hours of stowage, the crew utilized sample syringes to connect to the inner chambers of
each bag and remove 60 milliliters of the draw solution from each of the six bags and then stowed
them for landing. The reduction in ﬂuorescein of these samples was used with a standard curve to
calculate ﬂux. In addition, once the FOBs were returned to Earth a post-ﬂight analysis of the product
remaining in the bag was completed.

Flight Results

Results of this experiment demonstrated that the FO process functions in microgravity. Speciﬁc
ion rejection rates were the same as measured during ground testing. Flux rates were reduced in
microgravity by up to 50%. The ﬂux data had a signiﬁcant scatter. Ground based testing indicates this
error is due primarily to the materials of construction of the FOB. In addition, the ﬂorescent dye used
was also subject to photo bleaching in the ground tests and also contributed to the observed scatter in
the data. As a result the exact amount of ﬂux reduction in microgravity remains to be determined.
[28]

The syringe pump approach for both feed introduction and product removal was shown to work in
microgravity. The crew had no reported operational problems using the system. Results also
demonstrated that there was no statistically signiﬁcant difference between the ﬂux rate in the mixed
and unmixed bags. [28]

Signiﬁcant ﬂuid wicking occurred during the ﬁlling process as shown in Figure 10. This is not
characteristic in a l g environment. Although this wicking did not impede full ﬂuid coverage in the
ﬂight experiment it could be a problem if less than a full bag of feed is used. [28]

Future Work
HDU
A next generation FO-CTB is currently being developed for testing in the 2012 HDU. Plans are
to test the FO-CTB with hygiene water generated in the HDU and demonstrate the treatment of hygiene
water into a fortiﬁed potable drink similar to GatoradeTM or Country Time LemonadeTM. The product
will be analyzed to determine if it meets potable or food grade standards but will not be consumed by
the crew.

The CTB design used in the FT 12 FO-CTB will be updated to reﬂect the latest L2L CTB bag
design. This new CTB has been redesigned to facilitate unfolding into a ﬂat sheet. A picture of this
new bag design is shown in Figure 7 and Figure 8. The CTB shown in these ﬁgures was a prototype
conﬁguration and the ﬁnal bag will be modiﬁed to place the zipper on the right side panel. This is
being done to maximize the usable uninterrupted usable surface area of the bag.

The next generation FO-CTB is also currently being designed as of the writing of this paper. One
concept currently being pursued is the construction of a completely integrated FO bag system. In this
conﬁguration the FO membrane and plastic outer liner would extend over the entire surface of the CTB.
All plumbing connections would be integrated into the glue/seam pattern used to construct the FO
membrane array. Figure 9 shows the laminate cross-section of the proposed FO-CTB. This
conﬁguration is designed to use two FO-CTB ﬂipped and laying over another and slightly offset so that
the seams of one bag are covered by the water bladders of the second to provide radiation shielding.

Future ﬂight opportunities are being pursued. Two Detailed Test Objective (DTO) ﬂight
opportunities currently eXist. The FO—CTB bag is currently under consideration for a NASA directed
test objective (DTO) mission some time after 2013. The objective of this test is to demonstrate ﬁlling
and draining the FO—CTB in microgravity. It is expected that a series of these ﬂight qualiﬁed FO—CTB
bags could provide microgravity ﬂight demonstrations of individual technologies such as water, air, and
waste recycling, thermal control, radiation shielding and in situ structural element development. The
ﬁrst FO—CTB DTO is designated J SC—100.

The second ﬂight testing program will focus on re—ﬂying the FOB to fully quantify microgravity
performance. This ﬂight will differ from the ﬁrst ﬂight in that the FOB will be remanufactured out of a
more suitable outer bag material and a non—photo bleaching ﬂorescent dye. These ﬂights are scheduled
to ﬂy as a DTO payload sometime after 2013. This DTO is designated J SC—95.

Conclusions

This paper discusses the reuse of the CTBs to provide multiple functions such as radiation protection, life
support capacity in addition to their primary use as cargo transfer bags. This work is being pursued to
evaluate if reuse of these CTBs will reduce the logistics required to support 188.

The LTL concept redesigns CTBs to enable disassembly on—orbit (unfolding). The deconstructed
CTBs are then ﬁlled with water and reused for radiation shielding and life support functions. These CTBs
are modiﬁed to include a inner bladder that allows them to be ﬁlled with water. The CTB can then be used
as a radiation protection water wall. In addition, if the CTB bladder includes of a forward osmosis (FO)
membrane the CTBs can then be used to recycle wastewater.

A prototype FO—CTB was tested this August 2011 in the D—Rats HDU ﬁeld demonstration project. This
testing demonstrated FO water recycling bags integrated into a CTB simulator. The primary objectives to
construct the CTB, integrate it within the HDU, and demonstrate basic function as a water treatment system
were achieved. Future testing will further develop the FO—CTB concept into the ﬁt form and function of a
ﬂight system.

A ﬂight test of a stand—alone FO bag, the functional element of the FO—CTB, was completed as a sortie
payload aboard the STS—135 Shuttle Mission, STS—135 in early July, 2011. This mission tested a ﬂight
qualiﬁed version of the FO bags used in the FO—CTB. The ﬂight version of the bag is called the Forward
Osmosis Bag (FOB). This testing demonstrated that FO works in microgravity but ﬂux rates were
reduced. Future ﬂight test will be required to fully quantify this reduction in performance.
