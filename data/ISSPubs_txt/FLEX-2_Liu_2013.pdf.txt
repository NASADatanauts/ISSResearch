This study reports on an investigation of varying the initial droplet diameter (DO) over a very wide range
(from 0.5 mm to 5 mm) on droplet combustion. The droplet burning history is examined in an environment
of reduced convection as promoted by low gravity to achieve spherical droplet ﬂames. The fuels examined
are n-octane and n-decane. The long burning times for DO > 1.2 mm were accommodated in the Multi-user
Droplet Combustion Apparatus (MDCA) onboard the orbiting International Space Station (ISS), while
experiments for DO < 1 mm were carried out in a ground-based drop tower. The results reported encompass
the widest range of DO examined in the history of droplet combustion experimentation for a given fuel.
Both free ﬂoating (unsupported) and ﬂber—supported droplets are deployed and ignited. Quantitative data
are obtained from digital analysis of the individual Video images of the burning process for the droplet,
ﬂame and soot shell diameters.
Results show that the droplet burning rate decreases with increasing DO throughout the DO range
investigated. The mechanisms responsible include a combination of fuel molecule residence time effects
and radiative losses from the ﬂame, both of which inﬂuence soot formation to varying degrees. Assuming
that increasing soot formation (e.g., from increasing residence times) would lower heat transfer to the
droplet, ”small"" droplets (D0 < 1 mm, with negligible radiation losses) will burn slower as DO increases in
this initial droplet diameter range, which is consistent with the experimental results. For DO > 1.5 mm the
droplet ﬂames appeared less luminous and therefore less sooty, yet the droplets continued to burn
progressively slower as DO increased. This effect is conjectured to be the result of increased radiative losses
that would tend to reduce sooting that outweigh the longer residence times of the larger droplets that would
tend to increase sooting. The experimental results reported also include the evolution of relative distances
between the ﬂame, soot shell, and droplet diameters, all of which are inﬂuenced by D0.
1. Introduction
Droplet combustion has been extensively studied since the early work of Godsave (1953). This long-standing
interest stems from the need to better understand combustion of fuel sprays using a simpler combustion conﬁguration
that, at the same time, includes effects found in sprays such as complex combustion chemistry, fuel evaporation
processes, phase equilibrium behavior, moving boundaries, and transient effects. The base case of spherical symmetry is
ideal for this purpose. Figure 1 shows the droplet ﬂame structure for this conﬁguration. It consists of the droplet, a soot
shell that may form (depending on the fuel type) and the ﬂame all of which would be spherical and concentric for this
ideal case.

The classical droplet combustion theory (Tums (1999)) for the case of no soot formation or radiative effects, and
quasi-steadmess m the gas and liquid transport process, leads to the well-known prediction that (D/DO)2 = 1-K0t/DO2
Where D is the droplet diameter, t is time, and KO represents the burning rate value. As suggested, the square of droplet
diameter should decrease linearly With time With KO being constant (hence the rationale for sealing the droplet diameter
as (D/DO)2 and the time as t/DO2 m the presentation of the quantitative measurements discussed in Section 3). The reality
of droplet burning as shown by many studies for the based of Fig. 1 (e.g., J ackson et a1. (1992, 1994); Avedisian (2000);
Lee et a1. (1998); Bae and Avedisian (2009)) is different.

The inﬂuence of initial droplet diameter on K0, in particular, has been stimulated by its potential importance on the
droplet burning process. Figure 2a is a schematic of some of the trends reported. Early studies (Kumagai et a1. (1971);
Hara and Kumagai (1994)) ﬁrst employed unsupported 0r freely-ﬂoatmg droplets to study the effect of DO 0n the droplet
burning rate. The results showed a slight increase of K0 with Do. Later work (Jackson et a1. (1992, 1994); Lee et a1.
(1998) suggested that KO decreases With increasing DO.

diameters (DO < 1.2 mm); (b) Speculations for dependency of burning rate K in the larger droplet diameter range: A: K increases due to less soot
formation, B: K decreases due to more soot formation.

The mechanisms responsible for an inﬂuence of DO 0n K0 are speculative. They appear to principally include a
combination of fuel molecule residence time between the droplet surface and ﬂame, and radiative loss effects that would
be expected to conceptually inﬂuence soot formation and heat transfer to the droplet. For DO < 1 mm radiation should be
negligible (Marchese et a1. (1998)) and soot formation alone may be responsible for an inﬂuence of DO 0n K0. Radiative
losses become more signiﬁcant for DO > 1 mm, While the residence time continues to increase With DO suggesting that
either of the trends in Fig. 2b (”A"" or ”B"") could be Viable. To date, no data have been reported for DO > 1 mm With
complete burns to elucidate the transition in potential mechanisms controlling K0.

To provide a more complete picture of the inﬂuence of DO on burning, ground-based experiments were carried in
conjunction With 188 experiments (Fig. 3a) to investigate the combined range 0.5 mm < DO < 5.0 mm. The fuels are n-
octane and n-decane, as they are relevant components in gasoline and jet fuel surrogates, and have favorable attributes
associated With the ability to predict their thermal properties as well as combustion chemistries that are known. Figures
3b and 3c depict selected photographs of the droplet, ﬂame and soot she11 structure typical of free-ﬂoatmg droplets from

2. Experimental Methods

In order to achieve nearly spherical droplet ﬂames, the experiments are carried out in a low gravity environment
with experimental designs that restrict droplet motion. For 0.52 mm < DO < 0.85 mm, a ground-based 1.2 s drop tower
was used, while for DO > 1.7 mm the Multi-user Droplet Combustion Apparatus (MDCA) onboard the orbiting 188
provided the long time conditions needed to observe the complete burning process. In the range 0.85 mm < DO < 1.7 mm
no data are reported because GB experiments were limited to 1.2 s of experimental time and 188 experiments were
difﬁcult to carry out for droplets close to about D0 = 1.5 mm because of issues with droplet deployment that could impart
a signiﬁcant velocity to the droplets to move them out of the imaging ﬁeld of View. The experimental conditions were
room temperature air at atmospheric pressure. A brief description of each facility is given in the following discussion.

2.1 Ground-based (GB) Experiments

Brieﬂy, a test droplet is created by a droplet generator and anchored on the cross of two SiC (14 pm) ﬁber ﬁlaments
in a sealed combustion chamber ﬁlled with atmospheric pressure air. The size of the test droplet is controlled by merging
several fuel droplets until the desired D0 is achieved. The supported droplet is then subjected to a low gravity
environment by releasing the entire instrumentation package (the inner package with imaging systems, power supplies,
and spark circuitry, and the outer serving as a “drag shield”) into free fall. To reduce the disturbance attributed to
package release, 300 ms after free fall begins the test droplet is ignited by two symmetric sparks generated by two pairs
of spark electrodes on the sides of the droplet. The spark electrodes are retracted immediately after sparks are ﬁred in
order not to inﬂuence the ﬂame. Modeling of the droplet burning process on the small ﬁbers employed for D0 of about
0.5 mm (Liu et al. (2013)) showed a minimal effect on the burning process.

The timing of the processes is pre-programmed and triggered using a multi-channel signal generator (QC-9618,
Quantum Composer). The burning process of fuel droplets is recorded simultaneously by a black—and-white (BW) high
speed camera (MS-80K, CPL Inc., 200 fps, 3.9 MP) and a color camera (Hitachi HV-C20, 30 fps, 0.3 MP) from different
angles. Figure 4a shows the layout of the instrumentation package, and Fig. 4b illustrates the experimental procedures
associated with drop tower experiments. More details can be found in Liu and Avedisian (2012).

The MDCA onboard the orbiting 188 is a facility that allows burning fuel droplets to be studied in various
ambiences With or Without a supporting ﬁber (currently 80 pm diameter). Figure 5 shows a series of schematics of the
experimental apparatus and the procedure for forming and deploying free—ﬂoating droplets 0n the MDCA.

Fuel is deployed through hollow needles Which are then stretched slightly to form a liquid bridge that essentially
pre—stresses the droplet until the desired droplet size is reached (Figs. 5a and 5b). The needles are then quickly retracted
leaving the (ideally) stationary liquid droplet behind (Fig. Sc). In reality there is some small drift associated With uneven
motion of the needles. In the present study, only deployments in Which the droplet stayed Within the camera ﬁeld of View
are reported. Hotwire igniters are then energized (Fig. 5d) and retracted When the droplet is ignited (Fig. 5e). The droplet
ﬂame in the MDCA is recorded by a Hi—Beam camera (1 MP at 30 fps) With an infrared laser diode as a backlight and a
color camera (0.3 MP at 30 fps). A low light level ultra Violet (LLLUV) camera provides OH emission boundaries.

All the images are temporarily stored on the ""image processing and storage units"" (IPSUs) and downloaded to a
ground—based computer. The MDCA also has capability to deploy an 80 pm tether ﬁber (SiC) to examine the inﬂuence
on the support ﬁber. The time sequence of the above described procedures is pre—programmed for each test and remotely
controlled by the NASA Glenn Research Center in Cleveland, OH. The live Video of each experiment is fed to PCs in
NASA Glenn and Cornell t0 instantaneously monitor the experiments in real time.

2.3 Image analysis

The main diagnostic of the experiments reported here are the digital Video cameras that record the droplet burning
history. The images obtained from the ground—based experiments and 188 experiments are processed in a similar fashion.
Figure 6 shows how the dimensions of interest are extracted from the digital images for droplet, soot shell, and ﬂame
diameters.

"5","For the ground-based experiments, the droplet diameters (Fig. 6a) are extracted from the BW high speed camera images
using a Matlab program (Dembia et a1. (2012)). The green circle in Fig. 6a outlines the measurement generated by the
program. Figure 6b shows the manual measurement for a soot she11 diameter. Because n-octane and n-decane both
produce a considerable amount of soot aggregates during burning, the process of local soot accumulation sometimes
randomly breaks the symmetry of an intact soot she11. While this phenomenon does not affect the ﬂame symmetry, the
asymmetric part of a soot shell is ignored in the soot she11 diameter measurements, as shown by the bottom right comer
of the red dotted circle in Fig. 6b. BW images from the Hi-Beam camera of the MDCA are used to obtain droplet
diameters and soot she11 diameters using similar methods described above for ground-based images (see Figs. 6e and 61).
For the ground-base ﬂame images, the outer edge of the blue ﬂame (Fig. 6c) is used as the ”ﬂame"" diameter. This
deﬁned ﬂame diameter is not affected by the distortion of the inner yellow ﬂame (due to asymmetry of soot aggregation,
see Fig. 6d). For the ISS ﬂames, a different lens setting provides ﬂame images that are over-saturated near the ignition
point. A deﬁnite boundary outside of the inner bright core (Fig. 6g) can still be identiﬁed for ﬂame diameters.
Nonetheless, a typical n-octane 0r n-decane droplet ﬂame has a blue boundary that can be easily measured as shown in
Fig. 6h.
3. Results and Discussion
Figure 7 shows selected ﬂame images for n-octane droplets from both the ISS and GB experiments (the droplet
ﬂame images for n-decane are similar to n-octane in terms of soot formation and ﬂame structure and are not included in
the present study). The needle-like glows 0n the sides of the ﬂame in Fig. 7 are due to interactions between ﬂames and
supporting ﬁbers. The ISS and GB images are reproduced at different scales, Which are given at the bottom of the ﬁgure.
As shown in Fig. 7, the ﬂame brightness increases With increasing DO Within the range 0.52 mm S DO S 0.85 mm
(GB range), While the opposite trend is found for DO 2 2.16 mm for the ISS images. This observation appears to indicate
increasing soot formation With increasing DO for the small droplets, While for the larger (ISS) droplets radiative losses
keep the temperature down and limit sooting. For DO > 2.5 mm, a blue ﬂame is Visible soon after ignition, and the inner
soot-enriched ﬂame shows soot incandescence inside the blue ﬂame. A radiative extinction-like effect (Nayagam et a1.
(2012)) is found for D0 = 3.61 mm shortly after ignition.

"6","Figure 8 displays the burning history recorded using back—lighting that clearly shows the sooting dynamics for n-
octane droplets with various initial diameters. In the large droplet ISS experiments, soot shells are somewhat deformed
as the hotwire igniter arms are retracted. This early deformation leads to later soot “tails” on the sides of the droplet.
Also shown in Fig. 8 is a sequence from the ISS of a ﬂber—supported droplet (i.e., D0 = 2.64 mm). A noticeable external
ﬂow pattern is found after 0.4 s/mm2. The effect of the ﬂber-induced ﬂow is discussed below.

Figure 8. Selected BW images of buming n:octane droplets with different initial droplet diameters.

Figure 9a shows quantitative measurements of the evolutions of droplet diameter (or D2) for n-octane with different
initial diameters (0.52 mm 3 DO S 3.61 mm) obtained from analyses of individual frames in the burning sequences (e.g.,
Fig. 8). It is evident from the trends that the droplet burning process is slowed as DO increases. To more clearly show this
inﬂuence of DO on burning given that K0(t, Do), the total burning time was divided into sections within which the
evolutions of D2 was linearized to obtain KO for those sections. These time groups are identiﬁed in Figs. 9a and 10a (the
latter for n-decane) by the dotted lines.

Figures 9b to 9e show burning rates averaged within the four time intervals in Fig. 9a. The burning rate clearly
decreases with increasing D0 in each interval. As noted previously, two mechanisms are envisioned to bring about a
variation of DO on K0. In the ﬁrst, the fuel molecule residence time increases with DO (Jackson et a1. (1992)). In the
absence of any other process that could inﬂuence heat transfer to the droplet (e.g., radiative losses), increasing soot
formation would represent a lower heat release at the ﬂame, less heat transfer to the droplet, and a lower burning rate.
However, Fig. 7a shows comparatively less ﬂame luminosity for DO > 2 mm suggesting a lower sooting propensity as DO
further increases, yet Figs. 9b to 9e shows that KO continues to decrease. While sooting may be decreasing for the larger
droplets, concurrently the expansion of the ﬂame makes radiative losses from it a potentially important mechanism to
reduce heat transfer to the droplet. The fact that KO does continue to decrease (of, Fig. 9b to 9e) while the ﬂame

lower, though the post—extinction burning rate is still higher than the rate of pure evaporation for n—octane as shown by

the green data in Fig. 9a. For n—decane (Fig. 10a) When D0 > 3.97 mm the extinction process was more subtle yet still
revealed by disappearance of the ﬂame. The post—extinction burning rate for n—decane is about the same as for n—octane

"8","(cf, Fig. 9d and 9e for n—octane and Figs. 100, 10d and 10e for n—decane), though the pre—extinction burning rates are
considerably lower for n—decane, most likely due in part to n—decane’s higher liquid density. The extinction process for
spherical droplet ﬂames is an active area of current research (Nayagam et a1. (2012); Farouk and Dryer (2012)).

Flame and soot standoff ratios (FSR = Df/D, SSR = DS/D) in Fig. 11 and 12 show the relative position of the ﬂames
and soot shells to the droplet surface. Figure 11a shows that the FSR of n—octane slightly decreases With increasing Do.
This trend may be caused by lower ﬂame temperatures and thus smaller evaporation rates of larger droplets so that the
ﬂame boundary is situated closer to the droplet surface. Figure 11b shows the SSR for n—octane With different initial
droplet diameters. The SSR increases With DO over the DO range investigated.

Figure 12. Effect of initial droplet diameter DO on the ﬂame standoff ratio (FSR = Df/D) (a) and soot standoff ratio (SSR = Ds/D) (b) for spherically
symmetric n-decane droplet ﬂames.
The data in Fig. 11a and 12a (for n—octane and n—decane, respectively) suggest that the FSR, in general, decreases With
increasing D0. However, it is noticed for D0 = 1.71 and 2.37 mm in Fig. 12 that the FSR values are higher. These high
FSR values are caused by the very bright ﬂames of small droplets Which saturate the ﬂame boundaries such that it is very
difﬁcult to identify the actual “blue ﬂame” boundary because of excessive image saturation. Figure 12b shows the SSR

the observation for n-octane in Fig. llb. The trends subsequent to extinction show the expansion of the soot shell though
no further soot forms after radiative extinction. This radial expansion of the SSR after ﬂame extinction may be evidence
of diminished thermophoretic forces owing to disappearance of the hot ﬂame (though the gases are still hot). The
evaporation-induced force on soot aggregates would then balance thermophoresis at a larger relative distance from the
droplet surface compared to if the ﬂame existed.

Some of the ISS experiments were performed With droplets supported by 80 pm ﬁbers as noted previously. This
provided an opportunity to assess the inﬂuence of the support structure on the burning process. Regarding the evolution
of D2, Figs. 9a and 10a show several ﬁber-supported runs and Figs. 13a and 13b more clearly illustrate a comparison of
free and ﬁber-supported droplets With the same approximate DO value. The bigger is the droplet relative to the ﬁber the
smaller Will be an inﬂuence of the ﬁber on the burning rate. This general conjecture is consistent With the data in Figs.
13a and 13b, as well as Fig. 9 and 10 (cf, circled data in Figs. lOb-e and llb-e). Flame diameters can also be affected by
a support ﬁber as shown in Figs. 11a and 12a. In fact, for DO ~5 mm (Fig. 13b), the burning rates for the free and ﬁber
supported runs from the ISS are essentially identical. Regarding the FSR, larger FSRs for the ﬁber-supported data are
likely due to a ﬁber-induced gas phase motion Which results in slightly stronger fuel evaporation so that the ﬂame is
positioned farther away from the droplet surface. The insets to Figs. 13a and 13b (C and D) are photographs that
illustrate the nature of this motion. As shown, the soot aggregates are markers for the ﬂow and show a rather strong
inﬂuence for smaller D0 (D0 ~2.6 mm for n-octane; DO ~ 1.8 mm for n-decane). However, this effect appears to
signiﬁcantly decrease as the ratio of the droplet to the ﬁber diameter increases as shown by insets A and B in Fig. 13b.

Figure 13. Effect of supporting ﬁber (SiC, 80 5am) on the droplet burning histories for (a) n-octane With D0~ 2.6 mm, and (b) n-decane With D0~ 4.97
mm (photo A With no ﬁber, B With a ﬁber) and D0~ 1.8 mm (photo C With no ﬁber, D With a ﬁber).

The conventional interpretation of a ﬁber’s inﬂuence on burning is from heat conduction through the ﬁber. A
support ﬁber could also induce motion of the gas as noted above through its inﬂuence on transport of soot aggregates by
the forces (e.g., thermophoresis) acting on the aggregates. This induced gas motion could potentially inﬂuence the
droplet evaporation rate. The prospect for support ﬁbers to induce gas motion and its inﬂuence on the burning process
has not been previously considered, as prior work on ﬁber effects has focused primarily on conduction through the ﬁber.
4. Conclusions
The conclusions are the following.

1. Burning rates and FSRs decrease With increasing initial droplet diameters While SSRs increase With initial
droplet diameters.

"
"10","2. In the smaller droplet diameter range (0.52 mm S DO S 0.85 mm) where radiation effects are not signiﬁcant,
increasing initial droplet diameter leads to lower burning rate as DO increases, most likely attributed to
increased soot formation and a residence time effect.

3. In the larger droplet diameter range (2.16 mm S DO S 4.97 mm) where radiative losses become predominant
the burning rate also decreases with increasing initial droplet diameter but the effect may be more linked to
the increasing radiative losses and less heat transfer to the droplet than a direct role of sooting, which appears
to be less for the large droplet diameter range.

4. The 80 pm SiC ﬁber used to tether the fuel droplet 0n the ISS can induce external convective ﬂows around a
small droplet (~ 1 t0 2 mm) that signiﬁcantly increases the burning rate and FSR. For a bigger droplet (D0 ~
4.97 mm) the burning process is not strongly affected by the presence of the ﬁber.
