ABSTRACT
Thermocapillary (Marangoni) motion of a gas bubble under a temperature gradient cannot be present in a pure, one
component ﬂuid. Indeed, in such a pure system, the vapor-liquid interface is always at constant saturation
temperature. However, evaporation on the hot side and condensation on the cold side can occur and displace the
bubble. Such a phenomenon has been observed in two quite different ﬂuids, hydrogen and water Where buoyancy
has been suppressed. It is compared With existing theories and 1D numerical simulations. The experiments and
subsequent analyses are performed in the Vicinity of the gas-liquid critical point in order to beneﬁt of critical
phenomena universality features.
Experiments With hydrogen (H2, critical temperature: 33 K) have been performed in the facility of magnetic
compensation of gravity at CEA-Grenoble. A transparent Plexiglas tube holds the liquid H2 With a sma11H2 bubble.
Initially, both liquid and vapour are at the same temperature. Then the temperature of one or both ends of the tube is
Changed, resulting in temperature gradients between about 0.1 and 2 K/CIn. Surprisingly, the bubble moves
immediately to direct towards the hot end of the cell. The movement stops after a few seconds.
The experiment With water near its critical temperature (T 5373.995 0C, as precisely determined under
weightlessness) has been carried out in the DECLIC facility onboard the 188. Temperature gradients on the order of
+8.6 K/m and -8.6 K/m are successively imposed in the ﬂuid at 200 mK below its critical point. The bubbles move
towards the hot end of the cell With very low speed.
In order to better understand the above phenomena, a 1D numerical simulation is performed. It shows that, after the
temperature gradient has been imposed, two regimes can be evidenced. At early times, the temperatures in the
bubble and the surrounding liquid become different due to their different compressibility and the “Piston effect”
mechanism, i.e. the fast adiabatic bulk thermalization induced by the expansion of the thermal boundary layers. The
bubble motion is seen to be induced by the different local temperature gradients as resulting from
evaporation/condensation at the vapour-liquid interface. At long times, a steady gradient forms in the liquid (but not
in the bubble) that induces steady bubble motion towards the hot end. The bubble velocity is evaluated and
compared With existing theories.

The short time behaviour of the H2 bubble (motion

thus be satisfactorily explained by the short time

be reached in the magnetically compensated
environment because of the remaining gravity and
magnetic forces that prevent the bubble to move
