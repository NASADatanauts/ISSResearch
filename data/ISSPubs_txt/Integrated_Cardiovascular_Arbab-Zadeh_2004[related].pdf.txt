Background—Left ventricular compliance appears to decrease with aging, which may contribute to the high incidence of
heart failure in the elderly. However, whether this change is an ineVitable consequence of senescence or rather secondary
to reduced physical activity is unknown.

Methods and Results—Twelve healthy sedentary seniors (69.8i3 years old; 6 women, 6 men) and 12 Masters athletes
(67.8i3 years old; 6 women, 6 men) underwent pulmonary artery catheterization to deﬁne Starling and left ventricular
pressure-volume curves. Data were compared with those obtained in 14 young but sedentary control subjects (28.9i5
years old; 7 women, 7 men). Pulmonary capillary wedge pressures and left ventricular end-diastolic volumes by use of
echocardiography were measured at baseline, during decreased cardiac ﬁlling by use of lower-body negative pressure
(— 15 and —30 mm Hg), and after saline infusion (15 and 30 mL/kg). Stroke volume for any given ﬁlling pressure was
greater in Masters athletes compared with the age-matched sedentary subjects, whereas contractility, as assessed by
preload recruitable stroke work, was similar. There was substantially decreased left ventricular compliance in healthy
but sedentary seniors compared with the young control subjects, which resulted in higher cardiac pressures for a given
ﬁlling volume and higher myocardial wall stress for a given strain. The pressure-volume curve for the Masters athletes
was indistinguishable from that of the young, sedentary control subjects.

Conclusions—A sedentary lifestyle during healthy aging is associated with decreased left ventricular compliance, leading
to diminished diastolic performance. Prolonged, sustained endurance training preserves ventricular compliance with
aging and may help to prevent heart failure in the elderly. (Circulation. 2004;110:1799-1805.)
