The remarkable population size of the endangered clam Tridacna maxima assessed in
Fangatau Atoll (Eastern Tuamotu, French Polynesia) using in situ and remote sensing data.
— ICES Journal of Marine Science, 00: 000—000.
Several lagoons 0f the Eastern Tuamotu Atolls (French Polynesia) are characterized by
enormous populations of the clam T ridacna maxima, a species considered as endangered in
many locations worldwide. This unique resource is Virtually intact, until recently being
impacted only by local consumption. Increasing exports to Tahiti’s market (up to 50 tonnes
of wet matter y‘l), combined with the relatively small size of these lagoons (< 50 kmz),
have raised signiﬁcant concerns for agencies charged with management of lagoonal
resources. In order to evaluate whether the current harvesting pressure threatens long-term
sustainability of this resource, it is necessary to estimate the total number of individual
clams present and also the fraction of that stock that is currently targeted by ﬁshers, who
generally collect clams in very shallow waters (< 1 m), walking on the reef edges. Here, we
present results for a pilot study evaluating this resource at Fangatau Atoll. Using
a combination of data collected in situ and three remotely sensed images with different
spatial resolution (1.5, 5.6, and 30m), we estimate that the shallowest lagoonal areas
(4.05 km2 at depth < 6 m) harbour ﬁve classes of benthic habitat with signiﬁcantly different
clam areal covers and densities. Considering the cover/density values for each habitat class,
23.65 i 5.33 million clams (mean i 95% conﬁdence interval) inhabit these 4.05 kmz.
Assuming that current harvesting techniques will be maintained in the future, the
commercially available stock represents 44% 0f the population located on 1.18 km2 of the
shallow lagoon. A comparison of results from the three remote sensing platforms indicates
that high resolution, broadband multispectral sensors (e.g. IKONOS, Quickbird) should
provide the best existing platforms to conduct similar assessments elsewhere.

In Fangatau, no recent mortality events were reported 34%
before the May 2003 survey; however, in February 2004,
mortality occurred in the shallowest areas (< 50 cm) due to
abnormally low lagoon levels that left clams exposed above
water for an extended period. Unfortunately, the total loss of
clams could not be estimated. The primary cause of the
mortalities was an extremely poor renewal time of lagoonal
waters due to very calm seas and wind. For semi-closed Coral
