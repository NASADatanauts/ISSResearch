Abstract

The ﬂywheel exercise device (FWED) is planned for use as an in-ﬂight exercise system, to demonstrate its efﬁcacy as a
countermeasure device to prevent muscle atrophy, bone loss and impairment of muscle function in human beings in response
to long duration spaceﬂight. It is intended to be used on the International Space Station (188) and will be launched by the
European cargo carrier, the automated transfer vehicle (ATV) in late 2005. The FWED is a non-gravity-dependent mechanical
device based on the Yo—YO principle, which provides resistance during coupled concentric and eccentric muscle actions, through
the inertia of a spinning ﬂywheel. Currently, the development of a FWED Flight and Ground Model is in progress and is due
to be completed in May 2004. An earlier developed prototype is available that has been used for various ground studies.

Our FWED design provides a maximum of built-in safety and support to the operation by one astronaut. This is achieved
in particular by innovative mechanical design features and an easy, safe to use man—machine interface. The modular design is
optimized for efﬁcient set-up and maintenance operations to be performed in orbit by the crew. The mechanical subsystem of
the FWED includes 21 pg disturbance suspension, which minimizes the mechanical disturbances of the exercising subject at the
mechanical interface to the 188.

During the FWED operation the astronaut is guided through the exercises by the data management subsystem, which acquires
sensor data from the FWED, calculates and displays real-time feedback to the subject, and stores all data on hard disk and
personalized storage media for later scientiﬁc analysis.
