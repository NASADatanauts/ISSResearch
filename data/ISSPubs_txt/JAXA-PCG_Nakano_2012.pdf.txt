Received 5 March 2012 recently, the crystal structure of PZ peptidase A was determined at

tunnel that functions as a gateway for substrate and reactant mole-
cules, with the active site located in the centre of the globular protein
molecule (Kawasaki et al., 2010). We are speciﬁcally interested in
comparing the molecular structures of the two PZ peptidases and
determining the catalytic mechanism of PZ peptidase B using X-ray
crystallographic analysis. In contrast, the enzyme thimet Oligopepti-
dase (TOP), a mammalian enzyme, has a similar substrate speciﬁcity
to the Pl peptidases but shows a much lower identity (14% at most).
In addition, there is only a small difference between the catalytic
parameters of the Pl peptidases and 0f TOP (Sugihara et al., 2007;
Dando et aL, 1993). The structure of TOP has been reported not to
contain a tunnel for substrates and reactants as in PZ peptidase A;
rather, it contains a channel that runs the length of the entire protein
molecule (Brown et al., 2001; Ray et al., 2004). Therefore, we were
interested in identifying the differences in structure between PZ
peptidase B, PZ peptidase A and TOP. Here, we report the over-
expression, puriﬁcation, crystallization and X-ray analysis Of native
and selenomethionyl (SeMet) PZ peptidase B.
