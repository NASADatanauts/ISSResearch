(Received 11 December 2004; published 19 May 2005)
Recent simulations indicate that ellipsoids can pack randomly more densely than spheres and,
remarkably, for axes ratios near 1.25:1:0.8 can approach the densest crystal packing (fee) of spheres,
with a packing fraction of 74%. We demonstrate that such dense packings are realizable. We introduce a
novel way of determining packing density for a ﬁnite sample that minimizes surface effects. We have
fabricated ellipsoids and show that, in a sphere, the radial packing fraction ¢(r) can be obtained from
V(h), the volume of added ﬂuid to ﬁll the sphere to height h. We also Obtain ¢(r) from a magnetic
resonance imaging scan. The measurements of the overall density ¢avra ¢(r) and the core density gbo =
0.74 i 0.005 agree with simulations.
