Abstract
The isolation of Viable extremely halophilic archaea from 250-milli0n-year-01d rock salt suggests the possibil-
ity of their long-term survival under desiccation. Since halite has been found on Mars and in meteorites, haloar-
chaeal survival of martian surface conditions is being explored. Halococcus dombrowskii H4 DSM 14522T was ex-
posed to UV doses over a wavelength range of 200—400 nm to simulate martian UV flux. Cells embedded in a
thin layer of laboratory-grown halite were found to accumulate preferentially within fluid inclusions. Survival
was assessed by staining with the LIVE/DEAD kit dyes, determining colony-forming units, and using growth
tests. Halite-embedded cells showed no loss of Viability after exposure to about 21 kJ/rnz, and they resumed
growth in liquid medium with lag phases of 12 days or more after exposure up to 148 kJ/rnz. The estimated
D37 (dose of 37 0/o survival) for HCC. dombrowskii was 2 400 kJ/rnz. However, exposure of cells to UV ﬂux while
in liquid culture reduced D37 by 2 orders of magnitude (to about 1 kJ/rnz); similar results were obtained with
Halobacterium salinarum NRC-1 and Haloarcula japonica. The absorption of incoming light of shorter wavelength
by color centers resulting from defects in the halite crystal structure likely contributed to these results. Under
natural conditions, haloarchaeal cells become embedded in salt upon evaporation; therefore, dispersal of po-
tential microscopic life within small crystals, perhaps in dust, on the surface of Mars could resist damage by
UV radiation. Key Words: Halococcus dombrowskii—Simulated martian UV radiation—LIVE/DEAD staining—
