Abstract
Spaceﬂight effects on the immune system were studied in 30 cosmonauts ﬂown onto the International Space Station (ISS) for
long- (125—195 (1, n = 15) and short-term (8—10 (1, n = 15) missions. Immunological investigations before launch and after landing
were performed by using methods for quantitative and functional evaluation of the immunologically competent cells. Speciﬁc
assays include: peripheral leukocyte distribution, natural killer (NK) cell cytotoxic activity, phagocytic activity of monocytes and
granulocytes, proliferation of T—Cells in response to a mitogen, levels of immunoglobulins IgA, IgM, IgG, Virus-speciﬁc antibody
and cytokine in serum. It was noticed that after long-term spaceﬂights the percentage of NK (CD3_ /CD16Jr /CD56+) cells was
signiﬁcantly reduced compared with pre-ﬂight data (p<0.05) and NK activity was suppressed by 20—85% as compared with
pre-ﬂight data in 12 out of 15 cosmonauts. T—lymphocyte activity was decreased by 25—39% as compared with pre-ﬂight data in 5
out of 13 cosmonauts. However, the relative number of CD3+, CD4Jr and CD8Jr T—Cells did not change. The functional activity
of NK and T—Cells decreased in some of the cosmonauts after short—term missions. On the other hand, a moderate trend upward
of NK cytotoxic activity and proliferative activity of T—Cells was observed in some individuals. Concentrations immunoglobulins
(IgA, IgM, IgG) and levels of M and G antibodies to herpes simplex Virus (HSV), cytomegalovirus (CMV), Epstein—Barr Virus
(EBV) and herpes Virus type 6 (HV6) in serum did not reveal signiﬁcant changes after long- and short—term ﬂights. Concentrations
of cytokines (IL-1/3, IL-2, IL-4 and TNF-oc) in serum changed in an apparently random manner as compared with values before
long- and short-term missions. Despite the fact that many improvements have been made to the living conditions of aboard
the ISS our investigations demonstrate the remarkable depression of the immunological function after the ISS missions. These
results suggest that the clinical health risk (related to immune dysfunction) will occur during exploration class missions.
