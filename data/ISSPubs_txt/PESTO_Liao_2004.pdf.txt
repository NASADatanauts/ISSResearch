Abstract
Numerous spaceﬂight experiments have noted Changes in the roots that are consistent with hypoxia in the rootzone. These
observations include general ultrastructure analysis and biochemical measurements to direct measurements of stress speciﬁc en—
zymes. In experiments that have monitored alcohol dehydrogenase (ADH), the data shows this hypoxically responsive gene is
induced and is associated with increased ADH actiVity in microgravity. These Changes in ADH could be induced either by
spaceﬂight hypoxia resulting from inhibition of gravity mediated 02 transport, or by a non—speciﬁc stress response due to inhibition
of gravisensing. We tested these hypotheses in a series of two experiments. The objective of the ﬁrst experiment was to determine if
physical changes in gravity—mediated 02 transport can be directly measured, while the second series of experiments tested whether
disruption of gravisensing can induce a non—speciﬁc ADH response. To directly measure 02 bioavailability as a function of gravity,
we designed a sensor that mimics metabolic oxygen consumption in the rhizosphere. Because of these criteria, the sensor is sensitive
to any Changes in root 02 bioavailability that may occur in microgravity. In a KC—135 experiment, the sensor was implanted in a
moist granular Clay media and exposed to microgravity during parabolic ﬂight. The resulting data indicated that root 02 bio—
availability decreased in phase with gravity. In experiments that tested for non—speciﬁc induction of ADH, we compared the re—
sponse of transgenic Arabidopsis plants (ADH promoted GUS marker gene) exposed to Clinostat, control, and waterlogged
conditions. The plants were grown on agar slats in a growth chamber before being exposed to the experimental treatments. The
plants were stained for GUS actiVity localization, and subjected to biochemical tests for ADH, and GUS enzyme actiVity. These
tests showed that the waterlogging treatment induced signiﬁcant increases in GUS and ADH enzyme activities, while the control and
Clinostat treatments showed no response. This work demonstrates: (1) the inhibition of gravity—driven convective transport can
reduce the 02 bioavailability t0 the root tip, and (2) the perturbation of gravisensing by Clinostat rotation does not induce a non—
speciﬁc stress response involving ADH. Together these experiments support the microgravity convection inhibition model for
explaining changes in root metabolism during spaceﬂight.
