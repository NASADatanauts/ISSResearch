Abstract: In the frame of the EXPOSE-R mission outside the Russian Zvezda Module of the International
Space Station (ISS) passive thermoluminescence dosimeters were applied to measure the radiation exposure
of biological samples. The detectors were located beneath the sample carriers to determine the dose levels for
maximum shielding. The dose measured beneath the sample carriers varied between 317 i 10 and 230 i 2
mGy, which amount to an average dose rate of 381 i 12 and 276 i 2 nGy d_l. These values are close to those
assessed for the interior of the ISS and reﬂect the high shielding of the biological experiments within the
EXPOSE-R facility. As a consequence of the high shielding (several g cm‘z), the biological samples were
predominantly exposed to galactic cosmic heavy ions and trapped protons in the Earth’s radiation belts,
whereas the trapped electrons did not reach the samples.
