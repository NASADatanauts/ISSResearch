ABSTRACT

Large uncertainties are associated with estimates of equivalent dose and cancer risk for crews of long-
term space missions. Biological dosimetry in astronauts is emerging as a useful technique to compare
predictions based on quality factors and risk coefﬁcients with actual measurements of biological
damage in—ﬂight. In the present study, chromosomal aberrations were analyzed in one Italian and eight
Russian cosmonauts following missions of different duration on the MIR and the international space
station (188). We used the technique of ﬂuorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) to visualize
translocations in chromosomes 1 and 2. In some cases, an increase in chromosome damage was
observed after ﬂight, but no correlation could be found between chromosome damage and ﬂight
history, in terms of number of ﬂights at the time of sampling, duration in space and extra—vehicular
activity. Blood samples from one of the cosmonauts were exposed in vitro to 6 MeV X-rays both
before and after the ﬂight. An enhancement in radiosensitivity induced by the spaceﬂight was
observed. © 2003 COSPAR. Published by Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.
INTRODUCTION

Human space exploration programs, such as the international space station (188) and Mars
missions, require extended presence of crews in the outer space. In the present time, it is well
recognized that space radiation represents a major hazard to cosmonauts involved in interplanetary
missions, and that an increase in the duration of space ﬂights may result in an increase in the
associated cancer risk. Thermoluminescence dosimeters (TLDs) measure an accumulated skin dose,
which has to be translated into doses to critical organs by using transport codes, human anatomical
computer models and quality factors. Moreover, the interaction between radiation and space
conditions such as microgravity and uncertainties on the location of personal dosimeters 0n crew
members further complicate risk assessment. On the other hand, monitoring the biologically
signiﬁcant dose absorbed by the cosmonauts (biological dosimetry) may provide a direct assessment
of radiation risk in extraterrestrial activities. In previous work, a signiﬁcant increase in the yield of
chromosomal aberrations has been measured in peripheral blood lymphocytes (PBLs) of cosmonauts
involved in long-term missions (Testard et al., 1996; Obe et al., 1997; Yang et al., 1997; F edorenko et
al., 2001; George et al., 2001a). Using in vitro pre-ﬂight calibration curves, biological doses in the 20-
300 mGy range were estimated. Exposure to high LET radiation, such as that encountered in space,
can induce cell cycle delays and interphase death in highly damaged cells (Scholz et al., 1994). ,
Therefore, because of mitotic delay, cytogenetic analysis in metaphase chromosomes may result in an
underestimation of the damage induced by space radiation (Durante et a1.; 1996). Indeed, it has been

demonstrated that the frequencies of aberrations measured in chemically induced prematurely
condensed chromosomes (PCCs) are higher than those observed in metaphase spreads (George et al.,
2001b)

In the present work, blood samples from Russian and Italian cosmonauts involved in manned
space missions on the MIR station and the 188 were collected before and after ﬂights of different
duration. Cytogenetic damage in PBLs was measured with chromosome painting by ﬂuorescence in
sz‘tu hybridization (FISH) in mitosis as well as in PCCs. In addition, blood samples were irradiated in
vitro before and after the ﬂight and cytogenetic damage evaluated, to assess if the space mission
altered the sensitivity of human cells to ionizing radiation.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Chromosome Spread Preparation
Venous blood samples were collected in Vacutainer tubes containing sodium heparin (100 USP units).
Whole blood cultures were initiated in RPMI 1640 medium (Gibco, Invitrogen SRL) supplemented
with 20% calf serum and 1% phytohemmagglutinin (PHA; Gibco) and were incubated for 48 h at
37°C. After 2 h incubation with 0.2 pg/ml Colcemid (Irvine Scientiﬁc, Santa Ana, CA), mitotic cells
were swollen in 0.075 M potassium chloride for 20 min at 37°C, and fixed in methanol/acetic acid
(3: 1, v/V). Chemically induced PCCs (Durante et a1., 1998a) were obtained by incubation with 50 nM
Calyculin-A (Sigma Aldrich) for 45 min, and cells were collected as described above.
Irradiation
Whole blood was irradiated at room temperature with 6 MeV X-rays at a linear accelerator (Linac-
Saturne 43 GB). The dose rate was 2 Gy/min. The pre-ﬂight sample was exposed six days before take
off; the post-ﬂight sample three days after landing. The blood samples were cultured immediately after
exposure.
Fluorescence In Situ Hybridization
To remove residual cytoplasmic membrane and organelles, slides were incubated with 100 ng/ml
RNase A (Sigma Aldrich) for 1 h at 37°C (Hayata, 1993). After denaturation in 70% formamide/Zx
SSC (Sigma Aldrich), spreads were hybridized with whole-chromosome painting probes #1 and #2
(Vysis, Downers Grove, IL), according to manufacturer’s instructiOns. 4,6-diamidino-2—phenylindole
(DAPI) in antifade (Vysis) was applied as a counterstain. Slides were viewed with a Zeiss Axioscope
ﬂuorescence microscope and scored “blind”.
Classiﬁcation of Aberrations
The aberrations were divided into:
a) Simple exchanges: translocations and dicentrics (either complete or incomplete);
b) Excess acentn'c fragments;
c) Complex exchanges, arising from the interaction of three or more breaks on. two or more
chromosomes.

Statistical Analysis
Signiﬁcance tests were carried out by pair-wise comparison between speciﬁc groups with a Student t—
test or two—tail z—test. Radiation response data were compared by performing a multiple regression
analysis. Values of p<0.05 were considered as signiﬁcant. The dose response curves were analyzed
according to the equation Y: Yo + or D + [3 D2, where Y was the yield of chromosome aberrations, D
the X-ray dose and Y0, or and B the ﬁtting parameters, by using a non-linear ﬁtting package (JMP,
SAS Institute Inc., Marlow, UK).
RESULTS AND DISCUSSION

Pre- and post-ﬂight blood samples from one Italian and eight Russian cosmonauts were
analyzed (Table 1). Pre-ﬂight samples were collected within up to 341 days from launch, post-ﬂight

samples within 19 days from landing. The number of cells analyzed and aberrations observed in
chromosomes 1 and 2 in mitotic and PCC spreads are shown in Tables 2 and 3. Aberrant cells could be
observed in the samples of six cosmonauts. Simple exchanges were the most frequent aberrations and
only two acentric fragments were detected in the mitotic chromosomes. A wider array of aberrations
were observed in the PCC samples (Table 3). An increased yield of complex exchanges is considered
a “signature” of high LET radiation, characteristic of the space environment (Durante et al., 1998b). In
our study, no complex exchanges were detected in the mitotic spreads, while in the PCCs one complex
exchange in 1908 cells was observed in the post-ﬂight sample, which was not statistically different
from the pre-ﬂight measurement of two complex exchanges in 3397 cells. Also, no typical damage
associated with “rogue” cells (Testard et al., 1996; Obe et al., 1997) could be detected. Overall our
results appear compatible with previous ﬁndings in Giemsa-stained (Obe et al., 1997) or FISH-painted
(Yang et al., 1997; George et al., 2001a) chromosomes.

In previous studies the yield of exchanges in astronauts’ PBLs was slightly higher in PCC than in
metaphase samples (George et al., 20013). As shown in Table 3, there was no statistical difference
between the aberration rate in metaphase and in the PCC post-ﬂight samples (p values between 0.02
and 0.03, two-tail z—test), with the exception of complex exchanges. However, only one complex
exchange was observed in the PCC sample, and the scoring of a higher number of cells may be
required for a detailed statistical analysis.

As samples collected from the same cosmonauts before and after the mission were not always
available for analysis in mitosis, all pre- and post-ﬂight data were pooled together. A signiﬁcant
increase in the yield of total aberrations in metaphase chromosomes was observed after ﬂight (total
aberrations per cell in pre-ﬂight samples 2 0.0009i0.0006, in post-ﬂight samples = 0.0020i0.0010;
p<0.0003). In the PCC samples of cosmonaut #9 the yield of damaged chromosome after ﬂight did not
differ signiﬁcantly from background 'pre-ﬂight levels. Similarly, no signiﬁcant increase in
chromosomal aberrations was observed after a 10-day shuttle mission in two NASA/MIR crew
members (George et al., 2001a) and in French astronauts after a 2-3 week ANTARES ﬂight (Testard
et al., 1996).

At the time of sample collection some of the subjects had been involved in several space missions of the
duration of 9-198 days (Table 1). Interestingly, although cosmonaut #8 took part in the highest number of ﬂights
(ﬁve missions on the MIR space station, for a total of 485 days, at the time of sampling), n0 chromosome
aberrations Were detected in hisPBLs. As shown in Figures LA and LB, no correlation could be found between the
aberration yield and either the number of ﬂights or total ﬂight duration at the time of sampling (correlation
coefficients of 0.012 and 0.31, respectively). Dicentrics in PBLs have a half-life of approximately three years,
while translocations decay at a slower rate and’can be detected for decades after exposure (Edwards, 1997). Even if
only missions within three years form the date of sampling were taken into account, non-signiﬂcant correlation
coefﬁcients of 0.11 and 0.18 were measured (data not shown). In addition, the cytogenetic damage observed did
not correlate with the length of extra—vehicular activity (EVA; Figure 1.C). Interindividual variations (Testard and
Sabatier, 1999) as well as adaptation to cosmic radiation (Feinendegen, 1998; Pollycove and Feinendegen, 1999;
Upton, 2001) may be involved.

To evaluate if the space ﬂight altered cellular responses to ionizing radiation, whole blood from one
cosmonaut was exposed to X-rays at doses up to 5 Gy before and after the mission, and chromosome aberrations
were measured in chemically induced PCCs (Table 3; Figure 2). As expected, exchanges followed a linear-
quadratic dose response curve, while acentric fragments increased linearly with the radiation dose (Figure 2). Pre—
ﬂight values were slightly higher than, but compatible with, published data for dicentrics and translocations in
metaphase (Bender et 31., 1988; Lucas et al., 1992) or prematurely condensed (Stronati et al., 2001) chromosomes.
On the other hand, the lymphocytes collected after the ﬂight appeared to be more sensitive to radiation than pre—
ﬂight samples (Figure 2). This effect was signiﬁcant at the doses of 3 and 5 Gy (p<0.01). Not only a higher
percentage of aberrant cells was observed, but also the yields of exchanges, acentric fragments and pooled
aberrations were 1.2- to 2.8-fold enhanced after the ﬂight, depending on the dose and the aberration type.

The mechanisms involved in this change in sensitivity is unknown. Microgravity in space has been shown to
alter gene expression, and may affect responses at molecular, cellular as well as tissue and organ level (Homeck,
1992). Radiosensitivity appeared to be enhanced during space ﬂights in about 50% of the experiments performed,
but no synergy could be detected in the remaining 50% (Kiefer and Pross, 1999). In a study by Wu and coworkers
(2001), chromosome aberrations were measured by FISH in astronauts’ PBLs exposed to 1—3 Gy y—rays before and
22 h after an 8-day ﬂight. A small, non signiﬁcant, increase in the yield of total exchanges was observed at 3 Gy
only, which disappeared when the irradiation took place 14 days after landing. On the other hand, increased
radioresistance after a small priming radiation dose has been observed for a number of endpoints, including
chromosomal aberrations (Feinendegen, 1998; Pollycove and Feinendegen, 1999; Upton, 2001).

PBLs collected immediately after a space mission grow more slowly than cells collected before the ﬂight,
and it takes about two weeks for the growth rate to reach pre-ﬂight levels (Yang et al., 199 7). Moreover, after space
missions a decrease in PHA-stimulated lymphocytes blast transfonnation, in mitogen—induced production of
interleukin—2 and in cytotoxic activity of natural killer cells was observed (reviewed by Konstantinova et al., 1993).
Whether these effects are due to in—ﬂight conditions is yet to be clariﬁed, since samples are necessarily collected
after the stress associated with landing and reacclimatizing to terrestrial conditions. Even during the ﬂight, factors
other than microgravity, such as conﬁnement, drugs, cabin microﬂora, physical, psychological and hypobaric
stress, may be involved in immunological changes (Taylor, 1993). Space nradiation itself may have triggered this
increase in radiosensitivity. It has been observed that the lymphocytes of carcinoma patients treated with
radiotherapy, when subsequently exposed in vitro to ionizing radiation, showed a higher induction of chromosome
aberrations, compared to those from untreated patients (Neubauer et al., 1997).

In conclusion, in samples of cosmonauts involved in space missions there was an increase in chromosome
aberrations after ﬂight, but no correlation could be observed between chromosome damage and duration of
permanence in space as well as the number of ﬂights at the time of sampling. However, an enhancement in
radiosensitivity was detected in PBLs irradiated in vitro aﬁer landing. Whether this effect is only temporary and the
response to radiation returns to pre-ﬂight values with time needs to be investigated in further experiments.
