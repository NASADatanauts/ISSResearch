in mandibles from STS—131 mice (0.217 :I: 0.004 mm) compared to CC animals (0.283 :I: 0.009 mm), indicating
an anabolic (or anti—catabolic) effect of spaceﬂight, while CEJ—AC distance was similar between STS—135 and GC
mice. These ﬁndings demonstrate that mandibular bones undergo skeletal changes during spaceﬂight and are
susceptible to the effects of weightlessness. However, adaptation of the mandible to spaceﬂight is dissimilar to
that of the cranium, at least in terms of changes in BV/TV.
