Abstract. Shelf—lives of surfactant containing water — SiOz suspensions were investigated by
observing the loss of foamability with time and by making various measurements on the
compounds used. Main purposes were to discover the reason of the strong foamability decrease
with time and to separate gravity driven effects. These questions arose in the frame of ’FOCUS -
Foam Casting and Utilisation in Space’ microgravity experiment preparations (ID: SURE AO-
Ol9/PECS 98045, BC contract no: RITA-CT-2006-026069).
Foams were prepared using special foaming cartridges, by gas introduction after loading the
suspension into the porous structure of the foam generator (FG). Freshly infiltrated FG-s showed
superior foamabilities, but this feature was lost after a few days of storage.
Several possible Chemical or physical reasons were investigated experimentally, including the
direction of storage position, composition Change, storage temperature, etc. Investigation of gravity-
driven sedimentation and ereaming tendencies were also examined using dynamic light scattering
(DLS) method. These effects found to have significant impact on foamability.
Introduction

Processes behind the evolution of liquid foams from the formation to the disappearance is
intensively studied both from scientific and technological points of View.

The following experimental study is about the investigation of a simple phenomenon connected
to a complex system: the foamability loss with time of a nanopartiele and surfactant containing
suspension, which was filled into a solid polyurethane foam.

Our motivation was to study the shelf—life of this material as a preparation for ‘FOCUS’ space
experiment on the International Space Station. The shelf—life of the suspension in the FG-s was
critical both from scientific and integration points of View. The aim of FOCUS experiment was to
study a special foam generator and the foaming properties of FOCUS suspension under
microgravity [l]. The aim of this paper is to present the experiments connected to the shelf—life tests
of the FG-s, to explain the reason of the strong foamability decrease with time and to separate the
gravity-driven effects. Note that foamability means how much foam can be blown with fixed
parameters (gas ﬂow rate, FG dimensions, etc.) within a given period of time. Foamability refers
here not only the suspension, but the suspension and the FG together.

Materials and methods

'FOCUS' Foam Generators (FG). The PG material was a 'K2790' type partly open eell
polyurethane foam, product of Eurofoam Hungary Ltd. Optical and scanning electron microscopy
images showed that K2790 was highly polydisperse and most of the cell walls were broken or
hollow. There were also a significant amount of intact cells. All cells were smaller than 1mm2 and
more than 60% of the cells were smaller than 0.5mm2. The open porosity of the FG-s was above
95%. Cylindrical FG-s were used in all foaming experiments. In order to get rid of eontaminations
FG-s were washed in deionised water and dried at room temperature for 72 hours. The FG-s were
filled with the same amount (3.8g) of suspension in all cases, which meant a 65% rate of saturation.

'FOCUS' Suspension. The aim was to select a foamable liquid where the particle stabilisation is
significant and foams can be easily and safely produced using FOCUS FG-s at room temperatures.
The liquid used was a suspension of 2wt% hydrophobic fumed SiOz nanoparticles (trade name is
Wacker HDK-H15) in de-ionised water, containing various types of surfactants detailed in Table 1.
According to the manufacturer, the mean primary particle size of HDK-H15 is 18mm and the
agglomerate particle size is above 50pm. Surface area is 12Oi20m2/ g [2].

'FOCUS' suspension was prepared using magnetic stirrer by adding the surfactant (0.05wt%) and
then slowly portioning the silica nano—powder (2wt%) into the solution. The suspension was ready
after 90 minutes of stirring at 1200mm""1 speed. Strong sedimentation and creaming occurred after
switching Off the stirrer.

Foaming. Foaming experiments were carried out in the following manner: 1) The suspension
was filled into the FG-s. 2) The filled FG-s were placed into transparent polycarbonate tubes and
stored under various Circumstances, see below. 3) After storage, foams were produced by
introducing dry N2 gas into the FG-s at 0.1251/min ﬂow rate and 45kPa bubbling pressure at 1800
direction with regard to the gravity vector. 4) Foam volumes were determined after 10s of foam
generation using image analysis. 5) These foam volumes were then compared to the foams
generated from freshly filled FG-s with fresh suspensions.

The decrease in the foamabilities with storage time was investigated under the following
Circumstances: a.) varying the surfactant type (see Table 1); b.) varying the storage position (00, 900
and 1800 measured to gravity vector) C.) varying storage temperature (room temperature vs. -22OC).

One measurement point in the presented diagrams comes from 3 foaming experiments and the
mean scatter is roughly 20%.

Dynamic light scattering (DLS). DLS measurements were carried out at the BAY-NANO
Institute for NanotechnolOgy, Miskole, with a MANO317 Zeta Sizer (Malvern Instruments).
FOCUS suspension was used with 0.05wt% of SDS. A freshly prepared suspension was split into
11 separate test tubes (20ml each) in order to have unused samples each day. One measurement
always needed a new test tube because the previous ones were perturbed during sampling. One test
tube was used for one measurement series. The DLS measurements were carried out 011 the top,
middle and bottom part Of the suspension (Fig.02). One measurement consumed eea. lml of
suspension. Three measurements were carried out 011 each region and then the average and standard
deviations were calculated. The entire series covered 18 days Of storage.

Results

Surfactant type variation. Fig.03 (left) shows the foam volumes with storage time in the case Of
different surfactants. Strong degradation process occurred in all cases, independently of the
surfactant type. None Of the surfactants gave outstanding performance. The FG-s were stored
horizontally (90"") measured to the gravity vector.

Storage position variation. The filled FG-s were stored in 1800 (11p), 900 (horizontal) and 00
(down) positions, measured to the gravity vector. Fig.03 (right) shows the foam volume
measurement results. The 1800 storage position yielded the best results and with the 900 stored
samples we practically could not make foams after 14 days.

Storage temperature variation. The results of PG samples stored frozen (-220C) compared to
the samples stored at RT at 1800 position can be seen in Fig.04. Frozen samples behave much better

with no significant decrease in foamabilities. These FG-s were used right after reaching the RT.
SDS (see Table 1) was used as surfactant in the storage position and temperature variation

Sedimentation and creaming tendencies. Visual observation of ‘FOCUS’ suspension (using
SDS) Clearly showed that ereaming and sedimentation occur shortly after the preparation. Three
phases could be Observed after 2-3 hours of storage: one creamy top layer, one Clear part in the
middle and a sedimented Opaque part in the bottom of the suspension. The separation speed is high
in the beginning, and then it becomes moderate. Creaming is very strong in the beginning, as the
particle agglomerates travel to the top of the suspension. Sedimentation seems to go 011 at a constant
speed.

DLS results gave particle size distribution diagrams in three regimes of the suspension, Changing
with time (Fig.05). All measurements have a large scattering because of the increasing
polydispersity and due to sedimentation/ereaming processes during the measurements.

Fig. 5. Particle size distribution Change inside FOCUS Suspension.

No significant change can be Observed in the middle region, the particle agglomerates’size
distribution here stays between 100 and 250nm. Only the smaller agglomerates (SO-lOOnm)
disappear in the beginning. The upper and lower part Of the suspension becomes more and more
polydisperse with time. Aggregates 0n the top layer are mostly larger than 150nm and the size
increases with time. Some new populations arise around 20 and 30nm after 110 hours. The most
significant population is at 500-750nm in the end.

In the bottom part, all particle agglomerates are above 100nm in the beginning, but by the end of
the measurement we see populations only below 100nm. The fresh suspension contains mainly
100nm agglomerates, and a certain amount of them are attached to bubbles that were mixed into the
suspension during preparation. These bubbles together with the particles travel fast to the top and
the agglomeration continues on slowly.

Discussion

The reasons of foamability loss can be found in the FG structure and in the gravity-driven
processes inside the suspension. Foaming experiments revealed that the loss of FG foamability
occurs regardless t0 the applied surfactants. All Of these chemicals can adsorb t0 the inner surface
of the FG and t0 the particles causing poor foaming.

The storage positions affect the foamabilites differently. The worst results Obtained in horizontal
storage position, because the liquid slowly drained on one side of the FG and the gas during
foaming could easily escape trough the empty cells of the Opposite side of the PG. The same effect
was Observed during maerogravity foaming experiments at the ZARM Institute [3]. This gravity-
driven movement can be completely blocked with freezing that is why superior foamabilities of
frozen samples was Observed in our experiments. Low temperatures slow down the adsorption as
well.

Creaming and sedimentation eventuates within the cells of the FG-s and the liquid inside the FG
cannot be mixed again.

The driving force of this particle movement is the buoyancy force that acts on the bubbles
trapped inside the suspension during mixing and totally covered with particle agglomerates. Once
all the trapped bubbles that can move arrive on the top, ereaming stops. Particles inside the
suspension agglomerate and due to gravity they move to the bottom of the test tube (or to the
bottom of the cells inside the PG). Once the particles leave the suspension either by ereaming 0r
sedimentation, they lose their foam stabilising capability and this leads to the poor foamability 0f
the stored FG-s.

Conclusions
Foaming experiments using fresh and stored FG-s filled with ‘FOCUS’ suspension showed that the
main reasons behind the foamability decrease are gravity-driven processes: the drainage of the

suspension inside the porous structure of the FG and the sedimentation/ereaming 0f nanopartiele
agglomerates in the suspension.
