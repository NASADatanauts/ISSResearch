Abstract
We present results on the analysis of 100 mL medium samples extracted from sterilized foam (Smithers—Oasis, Kent OH) used to sup—
port the growth of a representative dicotyledon (Haplopappus gracilis) and a representative monocotyledon (Hemerocallis CV Autumn
Blaze) in NASA’s Plant Growth Unit (PGU) during a 5—day Space Shuttle ﬂight and ground experiments. At recovery, the media remain—
ing within replicate (n : 5) foam blocks (for both the spaceﬂight and ground experiments) were extracted under vacuum, ﬁltered and
subjected to elemental analyses. A unique aspect of this experiment was that all plants were either aseptically—generated tissue culture
propagated plantlets 0r aseptic seedling Clones. The design of the PGU facilitated the maintenance of asepsis throughout the mission
(conﬁrmed by post—ﬂight microbial sampling) and thus any possible impact of microorganisms on medium composition was eliminated.
Concentration levels of some elements remained the same, while some decreased and others increased. There was a signiﬁcant two—fold
difference between the ﬁnal concentrations of potassium when the Earth—based and microgravity experiments were contrasted.
