ABSTRACT: Angiogenesis and myogenesis occur in the surrounding skeletal muscles following distraction osteogenesis, but their mo-
lecular mechanisms remain unclear. The present study investigated morphological features of lengthened muscles and the time course
change of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), its receptors (VEGFR-l and VEGFR-Z) and myogenin gene expression proﬁles
related to angiogenesis and myogenesis in tibialis anterior (TA) muscles with a mouse model of distraction osteogenesis, which involves
1 week of waiting period (latency phase), 2 weeks of intermittent distraction (distraction phase), and 5 weeks of remodeling period
(consolidation phase). Macroscopic ﬁndings showed that lengthened TA muscles increased to approximately 42% longer and 10% heavier at
the end of the process when compared to pre-surgery. During the distraction phase, VEGF and its receptors were induced in the
vascular endothelial cells, myogenin-positive satellite cells and myocytes, and subsequently, capillary progression and myogenesis were
increased. Real-time RT-PCR showed that Vegf, Vegfr—l, Vegfr—2, and myogenin genes expression was enhanced during the muscle
lengthening. Vegf and Vegfr—l were upregulated following the recession of angiogenesis at the consolidation phase. We conclude that
upregulation of VEGF and its receptors by mechanical tension-stress could be involved in the process of angiogenesis and myogenesis
