length up to 0.30-0.35 mm. A representative picture is shown in Fig.
1. The other microgravity agarose-free reactor ('n. 616) contained a
larger number of smaller crystals (maximum length of about 0.2
mm). though some of them were damaged. Since STS-95 and pre-
tlight experiments showed (PPGMO crystals grown in agarose-free

be attributed either to the accelerations occurred during the re-enter
