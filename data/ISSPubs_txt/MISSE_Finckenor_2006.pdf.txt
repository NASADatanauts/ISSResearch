Hundreds of material samples were passively exposed to the space environment for
nearly four years as part of the Materials on International Space Station Experiment
(MISSE). The experiment was planned for one year of exposure, but its return was delayed
by the Columbia accident and subsequent grounding of the Space Shuttle ﬂeet. The
experiment was attached externally to the Quest Airlock. Atomic oxygen ﬂuence and
ultraviolet radiation dose varied across the experiment because of shadowing and space
station orientation. Over a hundred meteoroid/space debris impacts were found. Many
polymer ﬁlm samples were completely eroded by atomic oxygen. Some particulate
contamination was noted, but black light inspection and the transmission measurements of
magnesium ﬂuoride windows indicated that molecular contaminant deposition was limited.
Optical property changes in thermal control materials are discussed.
1. Introduction

In August 2001 during the STS-lOS mission to the International Space Station (ISS), astronauts Daniel Barry
and Patrick Forrester deployed two suitcases of materials samples to be passively exposed to the space environment.
These were the Materials on International Space Station Experiment, or MISSE, -1 and -2 payloads. These
suitcases were attached to the [SS on the Quest airlock (ﬁg. 1), where they were exposed to atomic oxygen (A0),
ultraviolet (UV) radiation, particulate radiation, thermal cycling, and the induced environment of an active space
station.

The MISSE program is a combined effort A I / _. ‘ _..,-' _ 1
between the Air Force Research Laboratory, NASA, in ?V ‘1 - ﬂ

Marshall Space Flight Center (MSFC) provided 7 ”7
not only material samples, but also supported "" 7' * f ,
thermal vacuum bakeouts and determination of ""‘5
outgassing properties of materials through either Figure 1. Locations of MISSE -1 and -2 on 188
MSFC-SPEC-1443 or ASTM—E-595. MSFC also
performed pre-ﬂight characterizations of mass, solar absorptance, infrared emittance, and optical transmission for a
number of samples.

The planned exposure for MISSE-l and -2 was nominally one year. After the Columbia accident, the shuttle
ﬂeet was grounded for two and a half years. MISSE-l and -2 were not retrieved until STS-114, after nearly four
years of exposure. Astronauts Steve Robinson and Soichi Noguchi retrieved MISSE-l and -2, and later deployed
MISSE-S.

MISSE results may be useful for current spacecraft designs, such as the Crew Launch Vehicle, the Crew EXploration
Vehicle, and the J ames Webb Space Telescope.

11. Environment

The MISSE suitcases were intended to ﬂy with one face in the ram direction and one face in the wake direction.
This would eXpose one set of samples to A0 attack, while the samples in the wake would be protected and see
degradation due only to UV radiation. However, [SS ﬂew in local vertical, local horizontal (LVLH) attitudes, both
X-aXis in Velocity Vector and Y-aXis in Velocity Vector, and X-aXis perpendicular to orbital plane (XPOP) attitude
during the MISSE eXposure. This means that the “wake” face of MISSE-l was eXposed to A0, which Kapton HN
erosion indicated was apprOXimately 1.1 X 1020 atoms/cm2 ﬂuence. A Russian solar array blocked the “wake” face
of MISSE-2 from A0 erosion, but this has not yet been conﬁrmed by polymer sample mass measurements. Here
after, the “ram” faces of MISSE-l and -2 refer to the sides that received the greater AO ﬂuence, and the “wake”
faces refer to the sides that received the lesser amount of AO.

Some uncertainty in the MISSE environment is
also due to shielding by the Quest airlock. Mass loss ' ;
of polymers across the suitcase indicates 20-25% . , ‘
variation in A0 erosion, with those closest to the -.
airlock showing the least erosion. This variation also ' 4 = L , ‘55:; .\
holds true for UV eXposure, as can be seen in ﬁg. 2.

MSFC ﬂew UV diodes for measuring the solar
eXposure on both the wake face of MISSE-l and the
ram face of MISSE-Z. Photoelectron production in
the diode created a current which was then collected ‘1”. 1.5.;
by a coulometer, measuring the integrated current I
over the entire MISSE eXposure. These UV sensors 3+1, 5r;
were optimized for one to 1.5 year eXposure and were -- ' ‘ ‘ '
completely saturated after nearly four years in space.

The measured UV dose was 1400 equivalent sun-
hours (ESH), but the actual dose is at least 5000 ESH,
as determined from modeling.

FEP Teﬂon can be approximated as a semilog function of solar eXposure, as follows:

Re = 0.05551n(ESH)— 0.184 (1)
where ESH is the solar eXposure in equivalent sun hours. Assuming the MISSE samples received on the order of
5000 ESH, the AO reactivity may be on the order of 0.29 X 10'24 cm3/aton1. This would indicate an A0 ﬂuence of
5.4 X 1021 atoms/cmz.

Mass loss of the Triton Oxygen Resistant (TOR) polymer from tray E8 indicated a ﬂuence of 6.5 to 6.8 X 1021
atoms/cmz, using AO reactivity determined from the Passive Optical Sample Assembly (POSA)—1 ﬂight eXperiment
and ground eXposures in the 5 eV MSFC Atomic Oxygen Beam Facility.

Radiation dosimeters were ﬂown in a number of locations on MISSE, but the results were not available at time
of publication.

The samples were eXposed to a thermal environment of mostly —40 0C to +40°C. MISSE—l and —2 went through
approximately 22,800 thermal cycles.

The eXperiment suitcases were surveyed for meteoroid and orbital debris impacts. 119 impacts were found on
the sample trays and baseplates, and 16 impacts were found on the sides of the PECS during de—integration at
Langley. Another seven impacts were found later. The largest impact found was approximately 3 mm in diameter.
Impacts on the samples and baseplates were almost uniformly distributed between the ram faces and wake faces
(table 1). This is very different from the gravity—gradient stabilized LDEF, where the ram face had an order of
magnitude more impacts than the wake face.

Particulate contamination was more of a concern than molecular contamination. Particulates were mainly
produced by mechanical failure of some of the eroded polymers, though silver oxide particles were observed.
Visual and black light inspection indicated very little molecular contamination, with only some deposition in the
Vicinity of a composite facesheet—aluminum honeycomb core sandwich (ﬁg. 4). Magnesium ﬂuoride windows
indicated little change in transmission.

"4","III. Results

Magnesium ﬂuoride windows were used to eXpose candidate solar sail materials to UV radiation while blocking
all AO. Transmission was measured before and after ﬂight to determine the level of molecular contamination. The
windows from tray E7 had very little change in transmission (ﬁg. 5), and some of the windows from tray E8 showed
a decrease in transmission, particularly in the shorter wavelengths (ﬁg. 6). This change in transmission is
comparable to some windows from the POSA-l ﬂight eXperiment that had 250 — 300 A of SiOX eontamination4.
However, as of publication, the contaminant ﬁlm has not been positively identiﬁed as SiOX or some other chemical
composition.

Solar absorptanee measurements of AZ93 thermal control coating samples support the observation of little
molecular contamination on MISSE. This coating, composed of zinc 0Xide in a potassium silicate binder, can
absorb contamination and subsequently darkens. While AO can remove hydrocarbon contamination, AO will
convert silicone contamination into a permanent silicate layer on the material surface. The POSA—l ﬂight
eXperiment had zine 0Xide/potassium silicate thermal control coating (IITRI Z93P) that darkened from a solar
absorptanee of 0.160 to 0.228 during 18 months eXposure in the presence of silicone eontamination4. Similar
coatings on MISSE, however, maintained a pristine white color (ﬁg. 7) and had solar absorptanee measurements of
0.15 , within instrument error of pre-ﬂight measurements (ﬁg. 8).

Triton Systems, Inc. of Chelmsford, MA has developed a number of AO-resistant polymers under a small
business innovative research (SBIR) contract to MSFC. TOR polymer ﬁlm of 2 mil thickness performed well, as
did the low modulus version TOR-LM. Both TOR and TOR-LM were eroded, but the AO reactivity was 1.6 X 10'25
em3/atom or less, assuming the minimum AO ﬂuence of 4.2 X 1021 atoms/em2 previously mentioned. COR ﬁlm, a
Clear version of TOR, yellowed but was intact. C-COR and C-TOR-LM ﬁlms were developed by Triton as
conductive versions of COR and TOR-LM, mainly for electrostatic dissipative purposes. 1.5-mil thick C-COR had
a cracked appearance, while the C-TOR-LM ﬁlm of the same thickness was mostly eroded through. AO reactivities
for the conductive ﬁlms were on the order of 4 to 5 X 10'25 em3/atom.

Of interest to the [SS program was the performance of beta cloth, a woven ﬁberglass mat impregnated with
Teﬂon, on MISSE. Aluminized Chemfab SOOF beta cloth is used as an outer cover on multi-layer insulation (MLI)
blankets on [$5. Chemfab SOOF is similar to the Chemfab 250F used in the Space Shuttle and Spaeelab MLI
blankets, eXeept that the silicone usually added for ﬂeXibility is omitted. Samples of aluminized beta cloth from the
same batch as [SS MLI blankets were ﬂown on both the ram and wake faces of MISSE. Samples of beta cloth with
slightly larger glass ﬁbers, referred to as “beta cloth plus”, and Chemfab SOOF beta cloth without the aluminization
were also ﬂown. All of the beta cloth samples were slightly darkened by the eXposure (ﬁg. 9). Solar absorptanees
for control and ﬂight samples are given in Table 2. All measurements were made with an AZ Technology
Laboratory Portable Speetroreﬂeetometer (LPSR) with a black background.

"9","IV. Discussion and Conclusions

The space environment eXposure did not appear to have a signiﬁcant effect on the optical properties of AZ93
zine oxide/potassiurn silicate thermal control coating on the ram face of MISSE-2. Magnesium ﬂuoride windows,
particularly on the E7 tray, maintained good transmission down to 200 nm wavelength. Some darkening was noted
on various types of beta cloth, both on the ram and wake faces. Many of the thin polymer ﬁlms exposed on the ram
faces were completely eroded away, with the exception of some ﬂuoropolyrners and the TOR and COR polymeric
materials developed by Triton Systems.

Some science on MISSE was lost due to the extended mission, but, particularly for the thermal control materials,
the additional A0 and UV was helpful in evaluating long term durability. Lack of widespread molecular
contamination on MISSE gives conﬁdence in using [SS as a scientiﬁc platform for materials study, though the
locations of future ﬂight experiments should be analyzed for line-of—sight to possible contamination sources, such as
engine plumes, vents, etc. MISSE’s Cleanliness gives us conﬁdence in the contamination control methods used,
especially materials selection and thermal vacuum bakeout criteria. While some may point to the lack of Space
Shuttle ﬂights for over two years as the reason for the low amount of contamination, there were a total of 14
Progress ﬂights, 9 Soyuz ﬂights, and 6 Space Shuttle ﬂights to [SS during the time MISSE-l and -2 were deployed.
The MISSE experiments were attached to the Quest Airlock, which had been in space barely a month as of August
2001. New hardware added to [SS between August 2001 and July 2005 included the SO, 81, and P1 Trusses, the
Canadarrn2 and Mobile Transporter, the Strela boom crane, and the Pirs docking module. This hardly constitutes a
quiescent eXposure to space.

Investigations are continuing for a number of samples not mentioned in this paper. Fourier transform infrared
(FTIR) spectroscopy, ellipsornetry, and other techniques will be used to study contaminant depositions. Vacuum
UV transmission in the 120 to 200 nm wavelength band will be measured for the magnesium ﬂuoride windows.
