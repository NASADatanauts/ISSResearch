: ° ° - 1. Introduction to stellar ﬂare observations by MAXI
- . Z : MAXI, the ﬁrst astronomical payload on J EM—EF of 188, has monitored all sky

: E : pulsars, low mass X—ray binaries, X—ray novae, X—ray bursts, stellar ﬂares, CVs,
' ' ' ' Gamma—ray bursts, numerous AGNs and so on I.

In this paper the detection of unexpected stellar ﬂares has been pointed out
in relation to a promising contribution to the GRXE I, despite insufﬁcient
statistics for the detection of stellar ﬂares. With this in mind, a potential
contribution to the GRXE is suggested, based on reasonable estimations of
luminosity with emission line simulation from detected thermal spectra of stellar
ﬂares by MAXI/GSC. X—ray ﬂuxes from CVs are detected as weak sources, but
it is possible to Obtain the total luminosity of CVs in the solar neighborhood in
order to estimate the contribution to the GRXE.

The MAXI has two kinds of slit cameras, the GSC (Gas Slit Camera) and
the SSC (Solid—state Slit Camera), both of which incorporate X—ray detectors
consisting of gas proportional counters and X—ray CCDs I. The GSC can
provide all—sky X—ray image every 188 orbit. The present Observations of stellar
ﬂares are conducted by the GSC Which is capable of detection With more
sensitivity for stellar ﬂares than that Of any other ASMs.

The GSC detection threshold was set at 20 mCrab or less per 188 one orbit,
hence the detected stellar ﬂares were 23 for 21 months whose luminosities were
distributed 1.6 X 1031 erg/s to 4.8 X 1033 erg/s I. Furthermore, the X—rays from
Cataolysmio Variables (CVs) are generally weak with variable intensity and are
occasionally produced with outburst. Currently, sources as weak as one mCrab
or so are identiﬁed by making blinking images for one, three and seven days.
Ten CVs are employed as effective ones to the GRXE.
2. Estimation of the contribution of stellar ﬂares to the GRXE
Stellar ﬂares from RS CVn’s, Algol’s, dMe’s, young stellar objects and other
ﬂared stars have the common property that hot plasma grows up suddenly. The
wide—ranging temperature distribution is capable of generating the various line
emissions required for the GRXE. The temperature of these ﬂares ranges from
kT: a few keV to N10 keV. All the data are obtained from ﬂares of known stars
near the solar system by unbiased observations of MAXI/GSC.

CVs, especially magnetic CVs, generally produce thermal emission with
higher temperature as kT:10N4O keV [E]. The contribution of CVs to the
GRXE is also estimated roughly in this paper.

2.]. Estimation of total luminosity of stellar flares t0 the GRXE

A total luminosity from 23 stellar ﬂares for 21 months can be estimated by
Z(luminosity[L] >< efoldingtimehb. The corrected result of the ﬁeld of View
as well as the live time and the energy band of 2N10 keV is obtained as
1.3(+0.3, —0.2) X 1031erg/s.

The stellar evolution is assumed to be equivalent to that of the neighboring
solar system. The ratio of the stellar objects relative to the mass of the Galactic
ridge region is obtained over the mass of the neighboring solar system, using the
following two sources of data : (i) From Cox I, the ratio of half the total mass
of the Galaxy over the mass near the sun for the average distance, d:42 po from
observed ﬂared stars, is estimated to be 6.4 X 106. (ii) From Revnivtsev et al I,
the ratio of stellar mass of the Galactic ridge and bulge over stellar mass near
the sun within the average distance is estimated to be 6.9 X 106.

Considering the factor of N 6.5 X 106 anyway, the total luminosity of 2—10 keV
can be obtained for the GRXE by multiplying the value of 1.3 X 1031erg/s as

0.85(+0.20, —0.13) x 1038 erg/s. (1)

In this estimation the following three uncertainties are not corrected. One
uncertainty comes from ﬂare duration time. Here an uncertainty factor for it
is given as e; e.g.,e N 0.5. Another uncertainty originates from the insufﬁcient
statistics which affect the result; e.g., the GM Mus reveals an extremely large
value of L X ’7', by one order of magnitude greater in comparison to the others.
If this data were replaced tentatively by the second large value of L X ’7', the
result of (1) would be N 0.37 X 1038 erg/s. Considering these two uncertainties
the result of the present estimation is expected as

(0.37 N 0.85% x 1038 erg/s. (2)

MAXI/GSC is considered as having a low luminosity out—oﬂ due to
instrumental capability. In order to estimate entire contribution of stellar ﬂares
it is necessary to evaluate the effect of low luminosity ﬂares and instrumental
out—oﬂ in low luminosity.

"
"3","A contribution of stellar flares t0 the GRXE 3
It is considered that the luminosity function of some stellar ﬂares including
solar ﬂares has a relation of N(L) : kL‘O‘ for the number of ﬂares v3.1) (e.g.,[§]
I). If the power law index is assumed to be or : 2 and the luminosity interval of
1030""“34 erg/s is effective in the GRXE, it is possible to evaluate an instrumental
cut—off of MAXI/GSC for the low luminosity to compare the observed data.

Thus obtained cut—oﬂ luminosity is around 1 X 1032 erg/s. Namely a correction
factor for undetectable ﬂares is estimated to be 26, corresponding to a low
luminosity cut—oﬂ, Where the factor, 6, is introduced as remaining uncertainty;
e.g., 6 N 1. Therefore, multiplying 26 to the result value of (2), the ﬁnal
luminosity for the GRXE is

(0.74 N 1.8)66 x 1038 erg/s. (3)
2.2. Contribution of CV8 and total luminosity from stellar flares and CV8
Preliminary results of CVs are given by Matsumura et al (in preparation). The
total luminosity of 10 CVs observed in the solar neighborhood is effective to the
GRXE to 21—month MAXI/GSC observations. The result of (0.9 N 1.9) X 1034
erg/s is obtained by estimation similar to previous section.

The average distance of CVs concerned is 282 pc. As estimated in the section
2.1, the ratio of stellar objects relative to the mass of the Galaxy was obtained
over the neighboring solar system. This ratio resulted in N 2 X 103. Finally the
luminosity from stellar ﬂares and CVs for GRXE is obtained as

(0.9 N 2.2)65 x 1038 erg/s. (4)
This ﬁnal value is consistent With the observed one, 2 X 1038 erg/s -.
3. Emission lines from simulated composite thermal spectrum
MAXI/GSC cannot obtain precise thermal spectra from stellar ﬂares. but it can
determine temperature as single temperature model. A composite spectrum of
observed stellar ﬂares is created using X—ray ﬂux f), temperature T)- and e—folding
time TZ- of each ﬂare as the equation,

F(E) : ZF(E,TZ-) >< fz- >< Ti/Z(fi X Ti). (5)

Figure 1 shows a composite spectrum obtained by the equation (5), Where
Suzaku response function With solar abundances is employed. Several emission
lines as well as Fe 6.7 keV and 6.9 keV are seen in this ﬁgure.

Thin thermal spectra from magnetic CVs are also expected although
complicated [E]. Nevertheless, the simulated spectrum of CVs is assumed to
be a thin thermal spectrum With kT:10 keV. Since the contribution of CVs
to the GRXE is N 20% as obtained in previous section 2.2, 20% thermal
spectrum With kT:10 keV is added to the composite spectrum of stellar ﬂares.
A ﬁnal composite spectrum thus obtained from stellar ﬂares and CVs based on
MAXI/GSC results is simulated as shown in Figure 1, Where it is noted that
a contribution lower than cut—oﬂ luminosity of stellar ﬂares is neglected. Now
equivalent Widths of several emission lines are estimated by line ﬁtting process
through Suzaku analysis method. Thus obtained equivalent Widths (eV unit) are
N 25, N 55,N 400 and N 100 for 1.8 N 2 keV (Si), 2.4 N 2.6 keV(S), 6.7 keV(Fe),
and 6.75 N 7.0 keV(Fe), respectively.

The Fe 6.4 keV line is usually emitted by ﬂuorescence. In deed CVs often
produce considerable strong ﬂuorescent 6.4 keV line. The 20% of average
intensity of 6.4 keV from CVs obtained by Ezuka and Ishida [E] is tentatively

"

estimated as N 30 eV. Furthermore, Fe ﬂuorescent line could be produced from
interstellar gas irradiated by stellar ﬂares. Similar mechanism to this is proposed
by Bond and Matsuoka to explain Fe ﬂuorescent line in AGN. The equivalent
Width of 6.4 keV by this mechanism is also tentatively estimated as N 20 eV.
The equivalent Widths of several emission lines in this section are slightly
weak in comparison to the observed ones -. Nevertheless, considering the
present rough estimation it is strongly suggested that various emission lines are
produced mainly stellar ﬂares and secondarily from CVs.

4. Conclusion
This paper is not aimed at achieving a complete explanation of the GRXE
by stellar ﬂares and CVs, but it is to notice that a major of the GRXE is
produced from stellar ﬂares and the second contribution is due to CVs. This
conclusion is based on the MAXI/GSC unbiased observations although statistics
and detectability analysis are not yet conclusive. However, further MAXI/GSC
observations Will make those better in future, While the assumption Will be
improved by progress of stellar ﬂare physics. In any case the present essential
conclusion would not be Changed even in future (Matsuoka et al in preparation).
