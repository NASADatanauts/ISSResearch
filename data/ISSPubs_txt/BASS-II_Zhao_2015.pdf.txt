Abstract: As a part of the NASA BASS and BASS-II experimental projects aboard the International
Space Station, ﬂame growth, spread and extinction over a composite cotton-ﬂberglass fabric blend
(referred to as the SIBAL fabric) were studied in 10w-speed concurrent forced ﬂows. The tests were
conducted in a small ﬂow duct within the Microgravity Science Glovebox. The fuel samples
measured 1.2 and 2.2 cm wide and 10 cm long. Ambient oxygen was varied from 21% down to 16%
and ﬂow speed from 40 cm/s down to 1 cm/s. A small ﬂame resulted at low ﬂow, enabling us to
observe the entire history of ﬂame development including ignition, ﬂame growth, steady spread (in
some cases) and decay at the end of the sample. In addition, by decreasing ﬂow velocity during
some of the tests, 10w-speed ﬂame quenching extinction limits were found as a function of oxygen
percentage. The quenching speeds were found to be between 1 and 5 cm/s with higher speed in
lower oxygen atmosphere. The shape of the quenching boundary supports the prediction by earlier
theoretical models. These long duration microgravity experiments provide a rare opportunity for
solid fuel combustion since microgravity time in ground-based facilities is generally not sufﬁcient.
This is the ﬁrst time that a 10w-speed quenching boundary in concurrent spread is determined in a
clean and unambiguous manner.

1. Introduction

Flame spread and extinction over condensed fuels in a microgravity environment has been the
subject of extensive theoretical and experimental studies due to the importance of fire safety in
human space missions [1-4]. Compared with burning in normal gravity, diffusion ﬂames in
microgravity are not affected by buoyancy-induced ﬂow, thus providing a chance to study the
fundamental meehanism(s) of low speed ﬂame quenching [5]. Transition from solid diffusion
ﬂame spreading to quenching extinction is a slow heat loss process characterized by a relative
increase in the rates of radiative and conductive heat losses compared to the rate of heat generation
[3]. Long duration microgravity time is desired for such studies, which in general cannot be
achieved by ground-based facilities.

Recently, NASA’s Burnng and Suppression of Solids (BASS and BASS-II) proj eet examined
the burning and extinction characteristics of a variety of solid fuel samples aboard the International
Space Station. Different thermally thin and thermally thick solid fuels were burned in concurrent,

opposed 0r stagnation ﬂow conﬁgurations in a small ﬂow duet. Each experimental run took tens
of seconds to minutes, depending on the sample type and ﬂow conditions. The challenge with thin
solid samples in concurrent ﬂow, compared with other conﬁgurations, is that ﬂame spreads much
faster, and ﬂames can become quite long. Because of size limitations, the ﬁJel sample is relatively
short and so a concurrent spreading ﬂame may not reach fully steady spread within the sample
length. The transient ignition and ﬂame growth process, however, provides a ﬂame spread history
that can be useful for the development of transient ﬂame models [6]. In BASS-II, a nitrogen
dilution scheme is used whereby the oxygen percentage in the Glovebox can be decreased to a
preset value so that ﬂame spread can be studied with oxygen percentage as an additional variable
parameter [7]. This facilitates the determination of the oxygen-ﬂow velocity ﬂammability
boundary of materials.

In this paper, BASS and BASS-II results will be discussed in detail. Flame growth, spread and
quenching extinction will be presented for a thin composite eotton-ﬁberglass fabric burning in
various oxygen concentrations and concurrent ﬂow speeds.

2. Experimental
All tests were conducted in a small ﬂow duct (shown in Fig. 1) within the Mierogravity Science
Glovebox aboard the International Space Station. The sample used is a composite cotton-ﬁberglass
fabric blend (75% cotton, 25% ﬁberglass). The thickness of the sample is about 0.32 mm with an
area density 18.2 mg/em2. The fabric is custom-made for a previous proj ect SIBAL [8], hence it is
referred to here as the SIBAL fabric. One major advantage of this fuel sample is the retention of
sample structure integrity after the combustible (i.e. cotton cellulose) is consumed because of the
ﬁberglass mesh. It does not crack or produce curly ash typically seen in pure cellulose samples
such as paper or cloth. In addition to [8], experimental studies using SIBAL fabric can be found in
[9, 10].

In the experiment, SIBAL fuel samples of two different widths, 1.2 cm and 2.2 cm, were used.

Both have exposed length of 10 em. The samples were mounted in stainless steel sample holders.

The fuel sample mounted to the holder was placed in the small ﬂow duct of oross-seotional size of
7.6 cm X 7.6 cm. The ﬂow speed could be varied from 1 to 55 om/s. The tests were conducted in
ambient oxygen molar fraction of 16% to 21%. Ambient pressure was 1 atm. It should be noted
that for a given test the oxygen concentration was ﬁxed while the ﬂow speed could be varied.

A KanthalTM’ 1 hot wire was used to ignite the fuel sample leading edge so that the ﬂame can
spread in a concurrent configuration. The ﬂame growth process was recorded by two cameras. The
side-View Video camera provided edge-on images of the ﬂat samples at standard Video framing
rates (29.97 frames per second). The top-View digital camera looked down on the top fuel surface
and provided high resolution still images of the ﬂame at a rate of about one image every 1.2
seconds. When ﬂow speed and oxygen concentration were low, the ﬂame became very dim blue
and was difﬁcult to see in the side Video camera. The top-View camera exposure times were long
enough (1/ 8 s-1/4 s) to easily capture high quality ﬂame images even for dim ﬂames right before
quenching. These still images provide a time history of ﬂame quenching that can be used to
compare with transient model results.

3. Results and Discussion

A total of 27 tests were carried out for the fabric samples in BASS-II, including 6 quenching
tests, 3 non-ignited tests, and 1 blow-off test. These are listed in the table in the Appendix. In
addition, four tests from the BASS series were selected as listed at the bottom of the Appendix.
These four tests are all 21% 02 cases at a fixed ﬂow velocity during each test. For those cases
with ﬂow velocity variations, the starting and the final velocities are indicated in the velocity
column. The rate of velocity change varies from case to case depending on the communication
between the astronauts and the ground crews and the manual adjustment time by the crew. Many
of these tests were used to determine the low-speed quenching limits as a function of oxygen
percentage. In some tests, the ﬂame quenched quickly or was not ignited. These samples were
reused in additional tests as indicated in the Appendix. These partially burned samples were i gnited
with a retractable igniter on one side of the sample at the fuel burnout position. These reused
samples in general had a short unburned length and provided less quantitative data, thus will not
be discussed in this paper.

Figure 2 shows ﬂame development stages of a 2.2 cm sample in 10 om/s ﬂow, 21% 02. Figure
2(a) shows side-View ﬂame tracking of ﬂame tip, ﬂame base, and ﬂame length. Figure 2(b) shows
ﬂame edge View Video still images at different stages. Note in the ﬁgure, ﬂow is from right to left.
After the igniter was turned on, a strong ﬂame was initiated on both sides of the solid fuel. The
ﬂame was stabilized and started to grow and move downstream. At about 19s, the ﬂame reached
a limiting constant length and a steady spread rate relative to the laboratory [1 1]. This steady spread
state lasted for around 9s. The ﬂame images look almost identical during this stage, as can be seen
at 20.17s and 24.83s in Fig. 2(b). Then the ﬂame tip (or more precisely the ﬂame preheating front)
moved close to the end of the fuel sample, and the ﬂame decayed in size until complete burnout.
The whole combustion process took about 40s.

Figure 3 shows ﬂame development stages of a 2.2 cm sample in 5 em/s ﬂow, 21% 02. Unlike
the ﬂame in 10 em/s ﬂow in Fig. 2, the ﬂame from the side-View Video is very dim in this case.
Figure 3 thus shows the top-View images and tracking from those images. Because the ﬂow speed
is lower, it took more than 60s to burn the Whole sample. Steady spread time lasts for about 21s,
much longer than the 10 cm/s ﬂow case. Virtually identical images at 35.5 9s and 45.5 9s are shown
in Fig. 3(b). In the top-View images, we can find bright spots behind the ﬂame base When the ﬂame
passes. The spots come from the smoldering of a small amount of fuel that is not complete
consumed by the ﬂaming combustion. Compared With the 10 cm/s case, the 5 cm/s case has a
shorter ﬂame and spreads more slowly.

Steady ﬂame spread here means the ﬂame reached a constant spread rate for more than 20s. Flames
spread more slowly across the narrower samples, at lower ﬂow velocities and at lower oxygen

Figure 5 shows a typical ﬂame quenching sequence in the BASS-II experiment. A 2.2 cm wide
sample in 18.7% 02 was ﬁrst ignited at 10 em/s ﬂow. Flow speed was decreased to 2.2 em/s
incrementally after ignition. Figure 6 shows ﬂame tracking and ﬂow speed vs. time. After ignition,
the ﬂame started to grow. As the ﬂow speed was reduced both ﬂame length and ﬂame width
dropped accordingly with ﬂow. After 25s, ﬂow velocity was reduced to 2.2 em/s and held there
for the remainder of the test. As shown in Fig. 5, both the ﬂame length and ﬂame width continued
to decrease approaching a eircular-shaped blue ﬂame seen from the top. The size of the ﬂame
continues to shrink until extinction is reached. This is typical in a quenching extinction sequence.
As the quenching limit is approached (in this case by turning down the ﬂow velocity), the fuel
pyrolysis rate and combustion Heat Release Rate (HRR) are reduced, and radiation loss becomes
a signiﬁcant fraction of the HRR from the shrinking the ﬂame. When the ﬂame becomes small
enough, conduction becomes the additional heat loss. The post-bum photo of the sample in Fig. 5
shows the narrowing of the burnt region as the ﬂame shrinks toward extinction with a substantial
part of the fuel left unbumt along the two sides of the sample holder. Although this is a
concurrently spreading ﬂame, the quenching sequence shows similar characteristics in opposed

For this thin fabric fuel in concurrent ﬂow, ﬂame spread rate is relatively large and the sample
is not long enough to ﬁne tune the ﬂow speed during the one to two minutes of experimental run
time. It is difﬁcult to get to the desired near-quenehing-limit state every time. Six quenching
cases were achieved during BASS-II for the SIBAL sample, four of them were for the 2.2-em
width samples. Along with the near-limit stable ﬂame data, we were able to draw part of the
quenching branch of the ﬂammability boundary as shown in Fig. 7 for 2.20m wide SIBAL fabric.
Quenching ﬂow velocities were found to be between 1 and 5 em/s with higher velocity at lower
oxygen percentage. This trend of the quenching boundary supports the prediction by earlier
theoretical models [1, 8]. The bottom part of the ﬂammability boundary that supports
combustion in the lowest oxygen environment is expected to be ﬂat in this ﬁgure and cannot be
determined accurately by this velocity-Varying procedure. Very near the boundary, i gnition 0f
the sample is sporadic. A procedure with gradually decreasing oxygen is needed. In addition,
because of the limited number of tests, the quenching limit for the 1.2-em wide sample was not
resolved. But it can be seen that the narrow sample has a smaller ﬂammable domain, as
expected.

4. Conclusions

Concurrent ﬂame growth and extinction over a thin ﬂat eotton-ﬁberglass composite fabric
sample was studied as part of the BASS and BASS-II space experiments aboard the International
Space Station. These long duration microgravity experiments provided rare opportunities for solid
fuel combustion studies. By reducing the ﬂow velocity during the tests, quenching extinction limits
were obtained accurately. The quenching velocities are small (between 1 and 5 cm/s), and an
accurate determination is necessary to resolve the slope of the quenching boundary. The
experimental data obtained supports earlier theoretical predictions (at least qualitatively) of solid
ﬂammability limits at low ﬂow velocities due to radiative and conductive losses. The ﬂame image
sequence at quenching shows the ﬂame shrinks both in length and width and the ﬂame goes out in
a three-dimensional manner.

In addition to obtaining quenching limits, the sequence of sample ignition, ﬂame growth, and
steady spread to final decay across the entire sample in low-speed purely forced ﬂows were
experimentally recorded. These are precious data to help us to understand the entire process of
ﬂame development in microgravity. They also provide the basis to check the theoretical model
development. Recently, a three-dimensional transient numerical model has been published [6] that
is suitable to simulate the present experiment. The model contains many material properties
including kinetic rate constants. Currently, we are measuring and deducing the pyrolysis rate
constants for SIBAL fabric in order to perform quantitative comparisons between the model and
experiment.
