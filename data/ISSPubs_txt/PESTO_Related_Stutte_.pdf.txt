"1","CULTIVAR EFFECTS ON RADISH SENSITIVITY/ RESISTANCE TO CHRONIC
ETHYLENE EXPOSURE

I. Eraso and G.W. Stutte

ABSTRACT .

The Radish Assimilation in Spaceﬂight Testbed Atmospheres (RASTA) experiment is being
developed to determine the effects of volatile organic compounds on growth and development in
microgravity. Three cultivars of Raphanus sativus L; Sora, Cherry Belle and Cherry Bomb Hybrid II,
were evaluated for resistance to ethylene effects. Radish will be used as an indicator species to
determine effects of biogenic and anthogenic volatile compounds within the International Space
Station on plant growth.

Radishes were selected as a candidate crop because of their short stature (<15 cm), rapid growth
cycle (14-24 days) and sensory characteristics (color, ﬂavor and texture). The radish cultivars were
exposed to ethylene concentrations of 0', 250 and 750 ppb for 21 days, which corresponded to control,
maximal, and phytotoxic concentrations in Cherry Belle radish (Eraso et al., 2002). Sequential
harvests at 7, 14 and 21 DAP were made and growth analysis performed.

All three cultivars exhibited characteristic symptoms of ethylene exposure, such as stem swelling,
height reduction, and severe leaf epinasty at both 250 and 750 ppb concentrations of ethylene. Cherry
Belle was more sensitive to ethylene exposure than cultivars Sora and Cherry Bomb, which were more
resistant than Cherry Belle at a concentration of 250 ppb. Ethylene affected harvest index of Sora at
both 250 and 750 ppb concentrations more than either Cherry Belle or Cherry Bomb. Additional
evaluations are required to determine the sensitivity and resistance of biologically active volatile '9
organic compounds found in spacecraft for these cultivars.

INTRODUCTION '

The Radish Assimilation in Spaceﬂight Testbed Atmosphere (RASTA) experiment was selected for
spaceﬂight to determine the effects of microgravity on carbon partitioning of a salad crop. Radish was

4 selected as test species because of their rapid growth cycle (14-24 days), sensitivity to environmental
changes, sensitivity to atmospheric contaminants, and sensory characteristics. One of the primary
objectives of the RASTA experiment is to determine the effects of chronic exposure to atmospheric
contaminants present in Spacecrafts (eg. space shuttle, International Space Station and future habitats) _
on productivity of plants. Plant exposure to volatile organic compounds (VOC’s) may promote plant
stress, which will affect the biomass production (Stutte, 1999) on radishes. Kostka-Rick and Manning
(1993) showed that changes in harvest index is a good indicator of chronic stress associated with
atmospheric contaminants on radish. This is due to a reduction of the hypocotyls while having
differential effect on leaf growth suggesting that plant biomass should be determined at the ratio
between the hypocotyls and the shoots.

The Radish Assimilation in Spaceﬂight Testbed Atmospheres (RASTA) experiment will determine
the effects of microgravity on the growth and development of Raphanus sativus L. A major goal of
the RASTA experiment is to separate the microgravity effects from the spaceﬂight environment
effects on crop growth. Ethylene is a plant hormone that causes many effects on plants including
chlorosis of leaves, elongation of roots, stems and cells, stem thickness, leaf epinasty, and ﬂower
senescence among many other effects (Abeles, et al., 1992). Current NASA guidelines for the
Spacecraft Maximum Allowable Concentration (SMAC) of ethylene is ~ 294 ppm (J ames, 1995), a

. concentration almost 10,000X greater than the threshold response for radish (Eraso et al., 2002).

"3","Accumulation on ethylene in a closed spacecraft environment has been implicated as primary cause of
lack of seed development of wheat grown onboard the Russian Space Station MIR (Salisbury et a1.
1997). Ethylene production studies on the growth of lettuce, tomato, soybean, and Wheat in a large
closed environment chamber were reported by Wheeler et a1. (1996). The results indicated that
concentrations in excess of 250 ppb could be expected to accumulate in the absence of an ethylene
removal system.

These ground-based experiments were performed to determine the effects of chronic ethylene
exposure on growth and development of three radish cultivars that are being evaluated for the RASTA
spaceﬂight experiment. The experiments were designed to evaluate responses under simulated
spaceﬂight environmental conditions of temperature, relative humidity and carbon dioxide
concentration. Ethylene concentrations were selected to represent atmospherically scrubbed
conditions (<50 parts per billion), possible intermediate to high concentrations observed during recent
ISS experiments (Stutte, unpublished), and chronic exposures previously observed on Russian MIR
module (750 ppb). .

Three Raphanus sativus L cultivars: Cherry Belle, Cherry Bomb and Sora wereused in these
experiments. These cultivars were determined from previous studies on radish responses to
temperature, light and CO2 (Stryjewski et al., 2001) and their effects on growth, total biomass and
sensitivity to ethylene (Eraso et al., 2002).

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Plant Material '

Three radish cultivars, Sora from J ohnny’s Selected Seeds (Albion, ME), Cherry Belle and Cherry
Bomb from Burpee (Warminster, PA) were used in these experiments. Six seeds were planted in g
OasisTM growing medium foam blocks, placed in magenta ﬂasks (6.3 x 10 x 6.3 cm) and 1X Hoagland
solution was added until saturation (approximately 250 ml per magenta). After draining excess
nutrient solution, the container was weighed and placed into small clear specially constructed Lexan ~ .
chambers (38 x 35 x 30 cm), which allowed for control of relative humidity and CO2. These chambers
were installed in a controlled environment chamber (CEC; Conviron, Winnipeg CA). Plants were then
maintained at a constant temperature of 23°C, constant C02 (1500 ppm), relative humidity at 75%, 18

‘ h light and 6 h dark photoperiod, and 300 pmol m""2 s'1 PAR with cool white ﬂuorescent lamps—VHO.
Following saturation of the Oasis foam at planting, the growth media was replenished daily to ~80 %
of the foam’s holding capacity starting at 7 days after planting (DAP). Two plants were harvested from
each ﬂask at 7, 14, and 21 days after planting. Each treatment consisted of 6 ﬂasks containing 2 plants
per harvest. Plant tissue was separated into shoots and roots, where shoot length, root length, root
diameter, root and shoot weight and leaf area measurements were taken.

Chlorophyll content was measured nondestructively at each harvest date with a Minolta SPAD-502
chlorophyll meter (Monje & Bugbee, 1992). Measurements were taken from the ﬁrst fully expanded
leaf and from the top of the plant. The reading was taken approximately from a point half the distance
between the leaf tip and halfway the edge of the leaf.

Chlorophyll ﬂuorescence of PSII was also determined on the same portion of the leaf using a .
modulated ﬂuorometer (OSS-FL) at the same location where the chlorophyll content was measured
(Genty, Briantais & Baker 1989). To avoid stress, measurements were taken inside the chamber on
dark-adapted leaves for 30 minutes acquiring values for Fm and F0 to calculate maximum PSII photon
yield (FV/Fm, Krause and Weis, 1991).

After fresh tissue was collected and measured, samples were placed in a drying oven at 75°C for 72
hours for dry matter determination.

"4","Ethylene treatment 2

A previously described flow control system provided independent control of ethylene levels in each
of the small chambers in the CEC (Eraso et al., 2001; 2002) and three ethylene concentrations (0, 250
and 750 ppb) were evaluated. Ethylene concentration was monitored with a Photovac 108 Plus
Portable Gas Chromatograph and with a 6890 Plus GC system. The detector used for the ethylene
concentrations were thermal conductivity and a ﬂame ionization detector (FID). An HP PoraPlotTM
column was installed in the GC (Q 25’ X 530 um ﬁlm), the carrier gas was helium at 6.6 ml/min at a
constant ﬂow and the oven of the GC was set at 20 °C (0 minute hold) programmed at 10°C/min to 54
°C (3 min.hold).

Growth analysis -

Growth analysis is very important for increasing the total yield crop photosynthesis and biomass
production through increased or extended light interception. Total photosynthesis has increased as a
result of increase of leaf area. Growth analysis parameters will help us to understand the increase or
decrease of photosynthesis per unit growth chamber area (since spaceﬂight missions are limited by
space). The understanding of plant growth analysis will provide an increase on total biomass
partitioning and achieved an increased productivity.

Statistical analysis

Two-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) was obtained using GraphPad Prism software, version
2.01. The analysis of variation was tested with three replicate values and the testwas performed at the
0.05 probability level. Values used for the growth analysis and ANOVA are the average of four
values per treatment and the average of three duplicated per treatment. ' ,9
RESULTS AND DISCUSSION

Exposure of the three radish cultivars to high concentrations of ethylene decreases total plant
biomass (Table 1). Sora had the highest total biomass of the three cultivars in the control treatment,
although this was not signiﬁcantly different from Cherry Bomb. Total biomass of all three cultivars
decreased with increasing ethylene concentrations. There were no statistically signiﬁcant differences

~ between cultivars at any concentration at harvest (Table 1). In contrast, there was a statistically
signiﬁcant difference in ethylene response between cultivars at the 7 and 14 day harvests. At 7 DAP
Cherry Belle had greater sensitivity to ethylene than Cherry Bomb and Sora. This effect was also
observed, but not to the same magnitude at 14 DAP and by the time they were harvested at 21 DAP
there is not a signiﬁcant effect of ethylene on the three cultivars by the end of the life cycle of the
radishes because they enter a phytotoxic stage due to the high concentrations of ethylene (750 ppb).
These results are similar to the ones obtained in a nutrient ﬁlm hydroponic system (Yorio et al.),
although cv Cherry Bomb had slightly greater dry mass than Sora in those studies.

Cherry Bomb also had higher Harvest Index (gm hypocotyls/gm total biomass) under control (<12
ppb) conditions than either Sora or Cherry Belle cultivars (Figure 1). Harvest index (HI) decreased
with increasing ethylene concentration for all cultivars. Relative responses of ethylene on HI were
similar for both Cherry Bomb and Sora, which both had greater relative sensitivity than Cherry Belle
(Table 1). These results are consistent with previous results of ethylene effects on radish development

' (Eraso et al., 2002).

Although there were signiﬁcant effects of ethylene on total biomass and HI of all cultivars, there
was no apparent effect on either leaf chlorophyll concentration or the potential electron quantum yield
of PSII (F V/Fm). In all cases, the values of Fv/Fm were above 0.8 indicating no physiological effect of
ethylene on photosynthetic potential of the leaves (see ﬁgure 2).

while increasing the ethylene concentration. The dry mass data obtained during the sequential

cm2 leaf area Per cm2 growth area), speciﬁc 1eafarea(SLA, cm2 gm dm‘l), and leaf area duration
(LAD, cm2 d' ), (Figure 3). These results are generally consistent with those observed with total dry
mass and harvest index. There is a correlation between absolute growth rate and net assimilation rate
showing a partitioning of photosynthesis into new leaf area as a component of growth when three
radish cultivars where exposed to chronic concentrations of ethylene. NAR (net assimilation rate) is a
primary function of photosynthesis particularly during the ﬁrst two weeks (Potter and Jones, 1977) and
these observations are consistent with the dry mass data also. During this 7-day (14-21 DAP) period,
values for NAR AGR, RGR, LAD, LAI and leaf area decreased with increasing ethylene
concentration, while the speciﬁc leaf area (SLA) increased when the ethylene concentrations
increased. These results suggest two primary effects of ethylene on growth and development of
radish. The ﬁrst is a reduction in total leaf area, which resulted in less potential for conversion of
photons to energy. As a result, the NAR was decreased. At the same time, while the plants are getting
smaller, leaf area per dry mass, stems and leaves from the three cultivars are getting thicker, which
increases the speciﬁc leaf area (SLA) of the plant and this response partially compensates for the
reduction in the net photosynthesis rate by absorbing a higher concentration of light as the canopy area
reduces overtime at higher concentrations of ethylene. However, radish cultivars are so sensitive to
the high concentrations of ethylene that any differences in sensitivity are masked as the crops develop.
In this experiment, there was not an interaction between ethylene concentration and'radish cultivar for
the growth cycle of radishes (21 days). g

In conclusion, radishes are sensitive to ethylene at an early age, which is the time where
radishes develop cotyledons and they are followed by the formation of the primary leaves and
consequently thickness of the hypocotyls. There were cultivar differences during the first two weeks »
after planting, but it was not observed signiﬁcance cultivar differences at 21 DAP. This suggests that
the ethylene response between cultivars consists of early sensitivity to ethylene, not a resistance to the
ethylene effect. On the other hand, ethylene concentrations affect cultivars differently during the

4 length of their life cycle and increases stress responses when the ethylene concentrations are increased
from O to 750 ppb. Basically, this response to chronic exposure to ethylene (750 ppb), suggests that
when the three cultivars reach a similar phytotoxic stage, there is no difference among radish cultivars
is detected. ,

Selection of the optimum radish during spaceﬂight experiments depends on many factors:
rapid growth, uniformity, sensitivity to ethylene, germination rate, and sensitivity to VOC (currently
being studied). Of the three radish cultivars exposed to ethylene, Sora had the greatest growth rate,
highest a leaf area per total plant mass (LAR), highest rate of carbon gain of photosynthesis rate per
unit of leaf area (NAR), highest photosynthetic potential of the plant (LAD) and highest total biomass
of the three cultivars under low (<12 ppb conditions). Cherry Bomb had less biomass, but a greater
harvest index than Sora at 0 and 250 and 750 ppb of ethylene. Cherry Belle had the lowest values for
for each of the growth parameters measured except for speciﬁc leaf area, where Cherry Belle showed
thicker leaves at each ethylene concentration (0, 250, and 750 ppb, see ﬁgure 3).

Cherry Belle is the most sensitive of the three cultivars when a ratio was taken for each one of
the growth values between the highest ratio from the control experiment (0 ppb) to the highest
concentration of ethylene (750 ppb, see table 1). Generally speaking, Cherry Belle had a greater
relative sensitivity to ethylene concentration than either Sora or Cherry Bomb. This suggests that
Cherry Belle would be the optimum cultivar for identifying growth responses to atmospheric

- contaminant. However, given the short duration of many spaceﬂight experiments, the rapid growth

could become the ideal radish as a diet supply on space missions. Future research efforts will be
directed towards understanding the relative sensitivity of Cherry Belle, Cherry Bomb and Sora to other
potential atmospheric contaminants in spacecraﬁ atmospheres.
Table 1. Relative responses of three radish cultivars to ethylene exposure were observed. Ratio of .
growth response at 0 ppb ethylene to 750 ppb ethylene treatment shows that Cherry Bomb is the most
resistant radish.
