It is said that the microgravity environment positively affects the quality of
protein crystal growth. The formation of a protein depletion zone and an
impurity depletion zone due to the suppression of convection ﬂow were thought
to be the major reasons. In microgravity, the incorporation of molecules into a
crystal largely depends on diffusive transport, so the incorporated molecules will
be allocated in an orderly manner and the impurity uptake will be suppressed,
resulting in highly ordered crystals. Previously, these effects were numerically
studied in a steady state using a simpliﬁed model and it was determined that the
combination of the diffusion coefﬁcient of the protein molecule (D) and the
kinetic constant for the protein molecule (,6) could be used as an indeX of the
extent of these depletion zones. In this report, numerical analysis of these
depletion zones around a growing crystal in a non-steady (Le. transient) state is
introduced, suggesting that this model may be used for the quantitative analysis
of these depletion zones in the microgravity environment.
Keywords: microgravity; transient and homogeneous field; transient and diffusive field;
protein crystal; numerical model; protein depletion zone; impurity depletion zone.
