Growing plants in space for using them in bioregenerative life support systems during Iong-term human space-
flights needs improvement ofour knowledge in how plants can adapt to space growth conditions. In a previous study
performed on board the International Space Station (GENARA A experiment STS-132) we evaluate the global changes
that microgravity can exert on the membrane proteome ofArabidopsis seedlings. Here we report additional data from
this space experiment, taking advantage of the availability in the EMCS of a centrifuge to evaluate the effects of
cues other than microgravity on the relative distribution of membrane proteins. Among the 1484 membrane proteins
quantified, 227 proteins displayed no abundance differences between p g and 1 g in space, while their abundances
significantly differed between 1 g in space and 1 g on ground. A majority ofthese proteins (176) were over—represented
in space samples and mainly belong to families corresponding to protein synthesis, degradation, transport, lipid
metabolism, or ribosomal proteins. In the remaining set of 51 proteins that were under—represented in membranes,
aquaporins and chloroplastic proteins are majority. These sets of proteins clearly appear as indicators of plant physi-
ological processes affected in space by stressful factors others than microgravity.
