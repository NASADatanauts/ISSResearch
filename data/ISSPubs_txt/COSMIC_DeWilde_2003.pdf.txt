1. INTRODUCTION

Several parameters have been identiﬁed In have an inﬂuenee en the eembustien synthesis
process and thus the ﬁnal product mierestrueture. whieh in turn affects its preperties. These
parameters include [1] eentpositinn of the initial reactant mixture. partiele size and mﬂrphﬂlﬂgj' ef
the initial reaetants. use ef diiuents or addition at inert reactants, green density of the eempaeted
pellet, preheating and heating rate of the reaetants, product geometry, presence of an inert er
reactive gas aunesPhere, and physical eenditiens at the reactants {i.e-. solid. liquid, andlet gZSL
Man},r of these parameters are interdependent and have a signiﬁeant effect an the ﬁnal product
ntnrpholngy. Specifically, their inﬂuence is related tn the EIDmCH'IIi'Eit)’ and ntass- and heat
transport-inﬂueneed phenomena. Hewever. when studying the relationship between the general
physieeehemieal meehanistns ef the eembustien preeess and the fnnnatinn ef the mierestntemrt
and product enmpositien. gravity is demenstrated to he an important parameter of inﬂuence [2-20].
Within the eembustien zene. a number nf gravity-dependent phenomena, such as eenveetien and
spreading ef tnnlten eemponents. bueyaney. and sedimentation of inert solid particles, droplet
coalescence. and densiﬁcatien of liquid products. can be identiﬁed. In urder tn elueidate the rule ef
gravity. a eemparatitre analysis is net:esaat'yr between samples processed in reduced gravity {else
called mieregravity} and normal gravity. Under certain eenditinns. gravity-dependent seeendary
preeesses may also eeenr in the heat-atfeeted zene after eemhustien. Other phenomena masked by
gravity inelude diffusinn and Marangeni ennveetien. Therefore, to clarify the process {If
ntierestnteture fnnnatien. it is necessary to investigate the effeet of gravity. Cemhining inferential:

that. the inferntatien obtained frent these studies gives a deeper understanding of the rule played by

In the put, it has been shown that samples processed under mieregravity eenditiens showed a mere
uniferm [2-13] and ﬁner miereetrueture [3.6-13} when compared with produets ehtained under
mm‘tal gravity eentlitiens. Ceneerning the pereeity distributien. a higher and more unifenn
porosity is observed [14-11]. In some eases. a different phase eempesitien i5 ebserved [2L3] and
enhanced properties are feund [I3]. Finally. under mieregravity eenditiens. eembustien
ehareeteristies such as eembustien wave veleeity. eembustien temperature. and width ef the
eembuetien front are found to be different with respect te terrestrial enee [3,18-20].

In this study. we investigate the mierestrueture fennatien nteehanisms during eembustien
synthesis at Al-Ti-B-eempressed powder mixtures to form intermetallie matrix eempositee {IMCS}
eensisting ef titanium aluminide as the matrix phase and titanium dihoride es the reinforcement
phase. The inﬂuence of the eempositien is studied both under henna! and microgravity eenditiens.
In this paper. we discuss and evaluate the scientiﬁc and teehnieel development ef the experimental
tools fer mieregraeity experimentation. In particular. the neeetzsm}t design criteria for acceptance
{e.g., 1tihttttittn and sheek resistance. thermal eyeling resistance, pteef preeeure and leakage,
humidity. eutgassing). safer (e.g., texieelegy. teueh temperatures, exposure te excessive light.

losses in the twt- black [21]. In fact, heat removal is favored, whereas heat productinn decreases
as the front proceeds in the ennical regien due tn shrinkage of the ernss section (Fig. 2).
Comequemly, the combustion frent ceases to advance so that the eriginal nuterial, the intermediate
WW. and the final product 311': frozen. and the evnlutinn nf the strueture during preheating,
combustion, and posteomhustinn can be investigated.

Each individual reeetnr enntsins an electrically heated Philips tungsten ignition enil and a
ttmgsten heat reﬂector sheet. used tn provide the heat needed fer igniting the sample. The power
supply (Le, 96!] w at :20 V-DC} is presided l'rnnt the MSG via a power ennneetnr and is
controlled by an electronics boat. The ignitinn ﬁlament is positioned exactly 1 mm above the
reacting material. Silt W-Re C-type thennhenuples placed intn the sample are used tn measure the
Immature etrnlutien during the experiment. Three thenneenuples are [nested in the cylindrical
pan, and the ether three are inserted in the ennieal quenching region. The thenneeeuple wires are
isnlated using thin eernntie tubes and are embedded in the sample material via drilled hnles. The
themtncnuples also serve as nneher points. which prevent the pellet from moving during
transportation. The output of these ﬂtennnenuples is passed to a mierhenntrnller after signal
ennditinning and analngfdigital ennversinn and ﬁnallyr stared.

The whole system of sample, enpper-quenehing hlnek, ignition ﬁlament, and so an. is
integrated in a reaetnr hnusing made of A15! 303 stainless steel. For direct experiment observation,
each reactor enntains a vaeuurn-tight Kelrez"" FFKM (perﬂuern elsstnntet'} rubber-sealed ﬁtsed
silica {IR grade} eptieal windnw [heated at the side {if the reaetnr. A Chetertn' 1671 thermal

and the enmmnn AA 6032-T651 aluminum base plate and the individual AIS! 303 stainiess-steel tnp
plates. respectively. thus providing a ﬁrst level of enntainrnent. Kslrez"" FFKM seals are chosen
because at their temperature resistance and their law gas penneability. Finally. each reaetnr
contains an AIS! 303 stainless-steel ﬁlling valve and a pressure sensor that are used for ﬂushing
and ﬁlling eaeh reaetnr with nrgnn and fur eentrniling and measuring the pressure inside the
reaetnr, respectively. Fnr safety,r reasons, the nuter surface temperature of each sample teeetnr

enntainer is measured using a thenneenuple. If the temperature reaches a value higher than 200°C,
the MSG will he switched ﬂff sutnmatieally, thus preventing the system from overheating and
ensuring the erew's safety.

The COSMIC reaetnrs are located inside a cylindrical AA 6082-T651 aluminum enntainer
settled en the AA 608241551 base plate. which farms the reaetnr ensemble (Fig. 3). The complete
reactor ensemble has a diameter {lf about 330 min. is approximately 220 mm high, and weighs 15
kg. It can be mounted on the enld plate inside the MSG, which is accessed by the lateral loading
port, using four M6 mumbserews placed an the reaetnr ensemble base plate. Twn windows are part
Hi the outer enntainer in front at each individual reaetnr. The inner windnw is made of ﬁtsed silica,
and the outer windnw is made of Lenten"" polyearhonate. The latter is selected because nf its impact
resistance. This type of windnw should not be ennsidered tn he shatterprn-nf, however. When
ﬂuttered, it will have a tendency tn break into pieces. which is net as dangerous. Both the DlllEl'
container and the windnws are sealed using Vitnn"" rubber seals tn provide two extra necessary

[Table 2). From X-l'aj' eemputer teumetgralzthjt.r it was observed that in settle nf the samples the

These results are in aeeerdance with these ehtained frem therrnneeuple analysis showing a
decrease in combustion wave velocity as the relative amount hf aluminide became higher (Fig. 8)
and cenﬂmted the decrease in esnthennieity with an increase of the melar ratin ef the titanium
aluminide with regard to the titanium diboride.

The fact that the ignitien ﬁlament became embedded in the top of the sample reactien

at the samples was impossible due to the presence of the ignition ﬁlament: all santples were in

4. CDNCLUSION AND FUTURE PERSPECTIVES
In this paper. we discussed designing a reaeter ensemble that performs eemhustien synthesis

experiments. including eemhustien frent quenching fer mierestrueture fennatien sequence analysis.
The present ticsign has been used fer microgravity experimentation in the M56 aboard the ISS and,
therefore. has te fulﬁll several technical and seientiﬁe requirements. The fatilily perfertnanee was
successful. except fer observing the eemhustien frent by a video camera. There are [we reashns fer
this: insufﬁcient light eerreetien hjtr the eantera present in the MSG and excessive smelte production
dining processing ef the sernple. The latter reason eeuid be attributed to the sample material and is
net granitg,r sensitive because similar prehlems had already eeeurred during missien preparation en
the ground.

The reacter ensemble has been used In stud}t IMCs based on the Al-Ti-B system with a
telathtelg.r high green density ef 65%1‘0 and with a different steiehiemeuy. Altheugh ground
referenee experiments still haste to be perfermed and analysis is in pregress. the microgravity
experiments have haen perfumed successfully. Analysis at"" the thenneeeuple data {front velneity}
and msereseepie sample inspection {eepper-quenehing bleek penetration depth) shew that there is a
decrease in esethennieity when the ratio at titanium aluminide tn titanium dihoride increases. This
result is in aeeerdanee with theoretical predictiens. Finally, further analysis is in progress and a
eemparisen will he made with en-grnund processed reference samples.
