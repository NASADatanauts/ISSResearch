(Received 28 February 2001; published 26 July 2001)
The depletion-induced phase separation in a mixture of colloidal particles (PMMA-latex) and nonadsorbing
polymers [p01y(styrene)] in a solvent (mixture of tetralin, eiS-decalin, and carbon tetrachloride) was investi-
gated in real space with confocal scanning laser microscopy in the initial, intermediate, and ﬁnal stage. It was
found that the kinetics and the morphology of the phase separation strongly depend on the polymer concen-
tration, and thus 0n the strength of the depletion-induced attraction between the colloidal particles. At moderate
polymer concentrations, crystallization of the PMMA particles is enhanced. At higher polymer concentrations,
only aggregation is observed, resulting in amorphous sediments. The aggregation is diffusion-limited 0r
reaction-limited, depending on the polymer concentration. Digital image processing was used to determine the
dependence of the aggregation rate and the size of the clusters on the polymer concentration.
