Abstract
Space radiation measurements were made on the International Space Station (ISS) with the Bulgarian Liulin—E094 instrument, which
contains 4 Mobile Dosirnetry Units (MDU), and the NASA Tissue Equivalent Proportional Counter (TEPC) during the time period
May 11—July 26, 2001. In the time span 11—27 May 2001 four MDUs were placed at ﬁxed locations: one unit (MDU #1) in the ISS “Uni—
ty” Node—l and three (MDU #2—#4) units were located in the US Laboratory module. The MDU #2 and the TEPC were located in the
US Laboratory module Human Research Facility (rack #1, port side). In this paper we discuss the ﬂight observed asymmetries in dif—
ferent detectors on the ascending and descending parts of the ISS orbits. The differences are described by the shielding differences gen—
erated by different geometry between the predominating eastward drifting protons and the orientation and placement of the MDUs
within the ISS. Shielding distributions were generated for the combined ISS and detector shielding models. The APSMAX and AESMAX
trapped radiation models were used to compute the daily absorbed dose for the ﬁve detectors and are compared with the ﬂight measure—
ments. In addition, the trapped proton incident spectra inside of ISS were calculated using calibration curve of MDU obtained during the
tests with protons at the Louvain—la—Neuve cyclotron facility. The energy of incident spectra maximums were analyzed against L value
for the individual passes through the South Atlantic Anomaly.
