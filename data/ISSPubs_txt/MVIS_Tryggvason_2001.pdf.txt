Abstract—Measurements of the Vibration environment on the Russian Mir space station and the
US Space Shuttle are compared to the Vibration levels predicted for the International Space Station
(188) and to the Vibration levels speciﬁed for isolated payload racks on the 188. The Vibration
levels on the Mir and Space Shuttle are generally lower than the levels speciﬁed in the ISS isolation
requirement for the isolated racks and much lower than the levels predicted for non-isolated racks.
Next a summary is given of several materials science and ﬂuid science experiments performed on
the Mir and the Space Shuttle and designed speciﬁcally to examine the sensitivity from ug to mg
Vibrations in the frequency range 1 Hz to above 100 Hz. These experiments were performed using
the Microgravity Vibration Isolation Mount (MIM) operating in one of the three modes: isolation
mode, non-isolation mode, and driven Inode. Signiﬁcant differences were obtained for the isolated
versus the non-isolated experiments and for the driven Inode experiments. This suggests that the
current 188 Vibratory speciﬁcation, which can be achieved only through the use of isolation systems,
is not conservative for many material science and ﬂuid science experiments. © 2001 Published by
