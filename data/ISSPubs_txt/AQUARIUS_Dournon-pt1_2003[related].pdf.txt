Abstract ' E E
7 E; 1, * r
E Among the urodele amphibians, only Cynops pyrrhogaster and Pleurodeles j ' E .-
l waltl, two species of the Salamandridae family, were used in space experiments. E: 3;
' The advantages for using urodeles reside (i) in reproduction: a few months after ‘ E -
natural breeding, females can lay eggs in absence of males after a hormonal . E ‘
treatment, because. spermatozoa were preserved in the cloacal pelvic glands of ' - 7 ‘.
matted females, (ii) in the rate of development which is slower in Cynops and E ‘7'? 7
Pleurodeles than in the anuran Xenopus, (iii) in their physiological properties: :' |
they can live in a closed water container or in a moisturized environment, and E E
they can fast during several days. Moreover, urodeles have an important ;
phylogenetic interest. Many biological phenomena differ from those of 3 E
anurans, such as fertilization events, the germ cell origin and the migration ' E
toward the differentiating gonads, and their regeneration capabilities. ' E g:
The main goals of the space experiments were to answer the following 3
questions. On the one hand, does fertilization occur normally in microgravity? ' f '
Is subsequent embryonic development normal in microgravity? Is further ;
development and reproduction normal after return to Earth? On the other i g
hand, does microgravity affect the organs in adult animals? Does microgravity ' r E
aﬁect the regeneration of organs? E ’ ;
Fertilization in space is clearly demonstrated. However, subsequent E E A
embryonic development appears to be altered in microgravity. In Pleurodeles, s
abnormalities such as cortical cytoplasmic movements, decrease of cell EE -n
adhesion, and loss of cells were observed. Although, early development was E ‘ '1‘
not strictly normal as a consequence of embryological regulation phenomena, i E 3
young hatching larvae had normal morphological phenotypes and swimming EE { ' E
behavior. After landing, no differences were observed between born—in-space ,

: Introduction 0
i Amphibians are subdivided into anurans, urodeles and gymnOphiona. Most of
i these vertebrates are characterized by metamorphosis and living outside of g
water with the exception of egg laying that occurs in water. In anurans, ‘
E tadpoles have inner gills located in lateral cavities where the forelimbs growing, '
3 and have a long tail to swim. After metamorphosis, the frog or toad has no tail 5
f and jump or swim with their long hind limbs. Anurans are classiﬁed into 4,381 .
t species (Lecointre and Le Guyader, 2001) and only a few of them were used for _
l space experiments. Some examples include Rana pipiens (Young and Tremor, '
1968), Rana temporaria (Vinnikov et al., 1973), Rana catesbz’ana (Bracchi et al., ,_
1975), Xenopus laevis (Vinnikov et al., 1976, 1980; Ubbels et al., 1989, 1994;
Souza et al., 1995; Black et al., 1996; Ubbels, 1997), and Hyla japonica A
[ (Feuilloley et al., 1993; Yamashita et al., 1997; see chapter on anurans in this
book). In urodeles, larvae have external gills and fore- and hindlimbs grown
; externally and not located in a cavity during their development. After i
. metamorphosis, the animals retain their tail, which is used to walk or swim. * 1
They are classiﬁed in 429 species (Lecointre and Le Guyader, 2001). Among the ' 7
urodeles, only Cynops pyrrhogaster and Pleurodeles waltl, two species of the j ‘
. Salamandridae family, were used in space experiments. The gymnophiona have .
l a worm aspect and are characterized by the absence of legs. These animals are ‘
f classiﬁed into 165 species (Lecointre and Le Guyader, 2001). No one has used . ;‘
1 them for experimentation in space ﬂight. 1 3‘-

The ﬁrst advantage of urodeles for space experiments concerns reproduction Q
(Gualandris-Parisot et al., 2002b). A few months after natural breeding, Cynops : -
and Pleuroa’eles females can lay eggs in absence of males after a preparatory .‘ .
hormonal treatment or by injection of hormone. Spermatozoa were preserved '
1 Of in the cloacal pelvic glands of matted females. During an induced egg laying, . 1
1 Of spermatozoa passed the jelly coat and penetrated the oocytes in a natural '
m1” manner as in normal in viva fertilization. On board space vehicles, only ‘
mg, inseminated urodele females were used to obtain embryos. In contrast, only . 3
tall anuran females were used in space, but as fertilization is external, spermatozoa ‘5:
381 were formerly prepared on ground and then used in space for in vitro - 1 '
for fertilization. The advantage for using urodeles resides in the rate of .
101’ development, which is slower in CynOps and Pleurodeles than in Xenopus. :3 1
$23 For these species reared at 18 °C, hatching occurs after about 20, 12 and 2 days, .1 _;;
, ’ respectively. Consequently, it is easier to study embryogenesis in detail on - 3 f' t
”C.“ . urodele species than on Xenopus. On the other hand, it is more convenient to 3 ~ 1
thls use Xenopus to study advanced larval development, since Xenopus grow more 5. .1 ' . .
»wn rapidly than Cynops or Pleurodeles. Another advantage is linked to the 1 1 ‘: 1
1,161 physiological properties of urodeles. Under experimental conditions, Cynops ‘ 5
'1m. females can live and lay eggs in a closed water container, and Pleurodeles .' 1.
the females can survive and reproduce in a moisturized environment (Yamashita 1 1 1 1, 1
the et al., 2001; Husson et al., 2001). Urodeles have slower movements than i 11 . 733.:

are during several days (up to 4 weeks for Pleurodeles). During the fasting period, *1 {4-}:

— their maintenance. Among the disadvantages, the molecular biology and ‘1 1 '1
‘S a genetics are less developed in these urodeles than in Xenopus. However, ‘ 1; . 1.;‘1

3 were rectangular and 80mm in length, 40mm in width and 20mm in height. ‘
! Inside each box, miniaquarium (10 ml) could receive at least ﬁve embryos in 3
3 tap water, which were separated by a porous membrane (5 pm) from an
air chamber (20ml). The miniaquarium also included a cartridge of a
3 ﬁxative liquid. For protection, each box was introduced in a hermetic . ‘i
