Abstract
Bone is a dynamically remodeled tissue that requires gravity-mediated mechanical stimulation for maintenance of mineral
content and structure. Homeostasis in bone occurs through a balance in the activities and signaling of osteoclasts,
osteoblasts, and osteocytes, as well as proliferation and differentiation of their stem cell progenitors. Microgravity and
unloading are known to cause osteoclast-mediated bone resorption; however, we hypothesize that osteocytic osteolysis,
and cell cycle arrest during osteogenesis may also contribute to bone loss in space. To test this possibility, we exposed 16-
week—old female C57BL/6J mice (n =8) to microgravity for 15-days on the STS-131 space shuttle mission. Analysis of the
pelvis by pCT shows decreases in bone volume fraction (BVfTV) of 6.29%, and bone thickness of 11.91%. TRAP—positive
osteoclast-covered trabecular bone surfaces also increased in microgravity by 170% (p = 0.004), indicating osteoclastic bone
degeneration. High-resolution X-ray nanoCT studies revealed signs of lacunar osteolysis, including increases in cross-
sectional area (+17%, p = 0.022), perimeter (+14%, p = 0.008), and canalicular diameter (+6%, p = 0.037). Expression of matrix
metalloproteinases (MMP) 1, 3, and 10 in bone, as measured by RT—qPCR, was also up-regulated in microgravity (+12.94,
+2.98 and +16.85 fold respectively, p<0.01), with MMP10 localized to osteocytes, and consistent with induction of
osteocytic osteolysis. Furthermore, expression of CDKN1a/p21 in bone increased 3.31 fold (p<0.01), and was localized to
osteoblasts, possibly inhibiting the cell cycle during tissue regeneration as well as conferring apoptosis resistance to these
cells. Finally the apoptosis inducer Trp53 was down-regulated by —1.54 fold (p<0.01), possibly associated with the
quiescent survival-promoting function of CDKN1a/p21. In conclusion, our findings identify the pelvic and femoral region of
the mouse skeleton as an active site of rapid bone loss in microgravity, and indicate that this loss is not limited to
osteoclastic degradation. Therefore, this study offers new evidence for microgravity-induced osteocytic osteolysis, and
CDKN1a/p21-mediated osteogenic cell cycle arrest.

Figure 1. Micro-Computed Tomography (uCT) Analysis of Spaceflown lschium. The ischium of the pelvis, shown in orange (A), was
analyzed using HCT (720 slices=4.89 mm). The anatomical markers used for HCT analysis were (1) caudal apex of obturator foramen, (2) dorsaI—most
point of the ventral ramus of ischium, and (3) the ischial tuberosity (A) (For full details on anatomical markers see [74]). The ischial cross—sectional
geometry (B) was analyzed by length (a), the width at the midpoint (b) and at 1/3 distance from the obturator foramen (c); and the bend angle (d).
Flight samples (D) exhibited a more open cross—sectional geometry compared to the ground control (C), indicating a possible reduction in the pull
force applied to the bone. Ground control samples (F) also exhibited greater thickness (orange/red) then the flight samples (G), indicating a
reduction in overall bone thickness in spaceflight samples.

Figure 3. TRAP Staining of Osteoclast and Osteocyte-Mediated Bone Resorption Following Spaceflight. Panel A displays a
representative cancellous region near the femoral head growth plate (40x) from ground control mice, which is mostly free of TRAP—positive
osteoclasts, whilst B displays a similar region from flight animals with numerous TRAP—positive osteoclasts. Analysis of osteoclastic activity in the
trabecular region below the femoral head of the femur showed an increase in osteoclast numbers in the bone surface of the growth plate of flight
samples compared to ground controls (9.99 Oc/mm and 3.36 Oc/mm respectively) (C). The bone surface covered by osteoclasts was also increased in
flight animals compared to ground controls (25.40% and 9.99% respectively, D). The number of TRAP—positive osteocytes in cortical bone from the
femoral shaft proximal to the femoral head was increased in response to spaceflight (E) compared to ground controls (D) (34.43% and 20.94%
respectively, F). However, we found no differences in the number of empty lacunae in cortical bone between flight and ground controls (10.6% and
