Evaluatlon of rodent spaceﬂlght 1n the NASA anlmal
enclosure module for an extended operatlonal perlod

The National Aeronautics and Space Administration Animal Enclosure Module (AEM) was developed as a seIf-contained rodent
habitat for shuttle ﬂight missions that provides inhabitants with living space, food, water, ventilation, and lighting, and this study
reports whether, after minimal hardware modiﬁcation, the AEM could support an extended term up to 35 days for Sprague-Dawley
rats and C57BL/6 female mice for use on the International Space Station. Success was evaluated based on comparison of AEM
housed animals to that of Vivarium housed and to normal biological ranges through various measures of animal health and
well—being, including animal health evaluations, animal growth and body masses, organ masses, rodent food bar consumption,
water consumption, and analysis of blood contents. The results of this study conﬁrmed that the AEMs could support 12 adult
female C57BL/6 mice for up to 35 days with self—contained RFB and water, and the AEMs could also support 5 adult male
Sprague-Dawley rats for 35 days with external replenishment of diet and water. This study has demonstrated the capability and
ﬂexibility of the AEM to operate for up to 35 days with minor hardware modiﬁcation. Therefore, with modiﬁcations, it is possible to
utilize this hardware on the International Space Station or other operational platforms to extend the space life science research use
of mice and rats.
