Microbiological monitoring is important to assure microbiological safety, especially in long-duration space habitation.

We have been continuously monitoring the abundance and diversity of bacteria in the International Space Station
(ISS)—“Kib0” module to accumulate knowledge on microbes in the 188. In this study, we used a new sampling device,
a microbe-collecting adhesive sheet developed in our laboratory. This adhesive sheet has high operability, needs no
water for sampling, and is easy to transport and store. We ﬁrst validated the adhesive sheet as a sampling device to
be used in a space habitat with regard to the stability of the bacterial number on the sheet during prolonged storage
of up to 12 months. Bacterial abundance 0n the surfaces in Kibo was then determined and was lower than on the
surfaces in our laboratory (105 cells [cm2]‘1), except for the return air grill, and the bacteria detected in Kibo were
human skin microﬂora. From these aspects of microbial abundance and their phylogenetic afﬁliation, we concluded
that Kibo has been microbiologically well maintained; however, microbial abundance may increase with the prolonged
stay of astronauts. To ensure crew safety and understand bacterial dynamics in space habitation environments, continuous
bacterial monitoring in Kibo is required.
