24 h average systolic, diastolic and mean arterial pressures (mean :1: SE) in space were reduced by
8 :1: 2 mmHg (P = 0.01; ANOVA), 9 :1: 2 mmHg (P < 0.001) and 10 :1: 3 mmHg (P = 0.006),
respectively. The nightly blood pressure dip of 8 :1: 3 mmHg (P = 0.015) was maintained. Cardiac
stroke volume and output increased by 35 :1: 10% and 41 :1: 9% (P < 0.001 ); heart rate and
catecholamine concentrations were unchanged; and systemic vascular resistance was reduced by
39 :1: 4% (P < 0.001). The increase in cardiac stroke volume and output is more than previously
observed during short duration ﬂights and might be a precipitator for some of the Vision problems
encountered by the astronauts. The spaceﬂight vasodilatation mechanism needs to be explored
further.
