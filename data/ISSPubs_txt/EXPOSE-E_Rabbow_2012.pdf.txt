Abstract
The multi-user facility EXPOSE-E was designed by the European Space Agency to enable astrobiology research
in space (low-Earth orbit). On 7 February 2008, EXPOSE-E was carried to the International Space Station (188) on
the European Technology Exposure Facility (EuTEF) platform in the cargo bay of Space Shuttle STS-122 Atlantis.
The facility was installed at the starboard cone of the Columbus module by extravehicular activity, where it
remained in space for 1.5 years. EXPOSE-E was returned to Earth with STS-128 Discovery on 12 September 2009
for subsequent sample analysis. EXPOSE-E provided accommodation in three exposure trays for a variety of
astrobiological test samples that were exposed to selected space conditions: either to space vacuum, solar
electromagnetic radiation at >110nm and cosmic radiation (trays 1 and 3) or to simulated martian surface
conditions (tray 2). Data on UV radiation, cosmic radiation, and temperature were measured every 10s and
downlinked by telemetry. A parallel mission ground reference (MGR) experiment was performed on ground
with a parallel set of hardware and samples under simulated space conditions. EXPOSE-E performed a
successful 1.5-year mission in space. Key Words: Astrobiology—Spacecraft experiments—Spaceﬂight—ISS—
