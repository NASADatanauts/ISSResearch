We report results of directional solidiﬁcation experiments conducted on board the International Space

Station and quantitative phase-ﬁeld modeling of these experiments. The experiments image for the ﬁrst

time in situ the spatially extended dynamics of three-dimensional cellular array patterns formed under

microgravity conditions where ﬂuid ﬂow is suppressed. Experiments and phase-ﬁeld simulations reveal

the existence of oscillatory breathing modes with time periods of several 10’s of minutes. Oscillating cells

are usually noncoherent due to array disorder, with the exception of small areas where the array structure

is regular and stable.
