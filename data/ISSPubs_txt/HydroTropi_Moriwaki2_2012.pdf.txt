Roots show positive hydrotropism in response to moisture gradients, which is believed to contribute to plant water acquisition.
This article reviews the recent advances of the physiological and molecular genetic studies on hydrotropism in seedling roots of
Arabidopsis thaliana. We identiﬁed MIZU—KUSSEII (MIZI) and MIZ2, essential genes for hydrotropism in roots; the former en—
codes a protein of unknown function, and the latter encodes an ARF—GEF (GNOM) protein involved in vesicle trafﬁcking. Be—
cause both mutants are defective in hydrotropism but not in gravitropism, these mutations might affect a molecular mechanism
unique to hydrotropism. M121 is expressed in the lateral root cap and cortex of the root proper. It is localized as a soluble protein
in the cytoplasm and in association with the cytoplasmic face of endoplasmic reticulum (ER) membranes in root cells. Light and
ABA independently regulate MIZl expression, which inﬂuences the ultimate hydrotropic response. In addition, MIZ] overexpres—
sion results in an enhancement of hydrotropism and an inhibition of lateral root formation. This phenotype is likely related to the
alteration of auxin content in roots. Speciﬁcally, the auxin level in the roots decreases in the MIZ] overexpressor and increases in
the miz] mutant. Unlike most gnom mutants, miz2 displays normal morphology, growth, and gravitropism, with normal localiza—
tion of PIN proteins. It is probable that MIZl plays a crucial role in hydrotropic response by regulating the endogenous level of
auxin in Arabidopsis roots. Furthermore, the role of GNOM/MIZ2 in hydrotropism is distinct from that of gravitropism.

Fig. 4. A model of the current working hypothesis describing the mechanism underlying hydrotropism in Arabidopsis roots. Factors involved in the
hydrotropic response are shown in relation to the root tissues speciﬁed. Red ellipsis includes main events that occur during the hydrotropic response, which
connects the perception of moisture gradients in the root tip (in lower green frame) and the differential growth in the elongation zone (in upper blue frame).
White arrows indicate the causal relationships among the factors. Moisture gradients are perceived in the root—cap region, and the signal is transmitted to
the elongation zone where it induces bending. M121 and GNOM/MIZ2 are indispensable for the induction of hydrotropism. MIZ1 functions upstream of
MIZZ and is hypothesized to reduce auxin level. The HYS—mediated light response and water—stress—induced biosynthesis of ABA upregulate MIZ1 tran—
