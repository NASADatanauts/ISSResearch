Network latency tion. The goal of the GS is to lower ﬁnancial and engineering barriers that hinder access
to science and engineering data from orbit.

The basic design of the virtual GS on a user side is based on free software suites. Using
these and other software tools the GS is able to provide access to orbit for a multitude of
users without each having to go through the costly setups. We present the design and
implementation of the virtual GS in a higher education and scientiﬁc outreach settings. We
also discuss the basic architecture of the single existing system and the beneﬁts of a
proposed distributed system. Details of the software tools and their applicability to

and teams at Graz University of Technology, Austria, EXA—Ecuador, University of Michigan,
USA and JAXA who have participated in various mission operations and have investigated
real—time satellite data download and image acquisition and processing. Students and other
remote users at these institutions undergo training with in orbit satellites in preparation
for their own use with future university—class nano—satellites’ post launch space operations.

The exclusive ability of Hermes—A/Minotaur to act as a gateway between remote users
(internet) and satellites (in orbit) makes the virtual GS at user—end more feasible for the
long—term real—time nano/cubesats space operations. The only requirement is to have a
mutual agreement between EXA and participating university/research organization and
broadband internet connection at user—end. With successful and remote satellite tracking
and downloading of real—time data from many operational satellites, the Hermes has been
found a reliable potential GS for current and future university missions and a training
platform for individuals pursuing space operations.
