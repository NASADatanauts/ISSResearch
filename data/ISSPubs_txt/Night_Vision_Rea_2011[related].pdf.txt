Abstract
Evolutionary mechanisms adopted by the photosynthetic apparatus to modifications in the Earth’s atmosphere on a
geological time-scale remain a focus of intense research. The photosynthetic machinery has had to cope with continuously
changing environmental conditions and particularly with the complex ionizing radiation emitted by solar flares. The
photosynthetic D1 protein, being the site of electron tunneling-mediated charge separation and solar energy transduction,
is a hot spot for the generation of radiation-induced radical injuries. We explored the possibility to produce D1 variants
tolerant to ionizing radiation in Chlamydomonas reinhardtii and clarified the effect of radiation-induced oxidative damage
on the photosynthetic proteins evolution. In vitro directed evolution strategies targeted at the D1 protein were adopted to
create libraries of chlamydomonas random mutants, subsequently selected by exposures to radicaI-generating proton or
neutron sources. The common trend observed in the D1 aminoacidic substitutions was the replacement of less polar by
more polar amino acids. The applied selection pressure forced replacement of residues more sensitive to oxidative damage
with less sensitive ones, suggesting that ionizing radiation may have been one of the driving forces in the evolution of the
eukaryotic photosynthetic apparatus. A set of the identified aminoacidic substitutions, close to the secondary
plastoquinone binding niche and oxygen evolving complex, were introduced by site-directed mutagenesis in un-
transformed strains, and their sensitivity to free radicals attack analyzed. Mutants displayed reduced electron transport
efficiency in physiological conditions, and increased photosynthetic performance stability and oxygen evolution capacity in
stressful high—Iight conditions. Finally, comparative in silico analyses of D1 aminoacidic sequences of organisms differently
located in the evolution chain, revealed a higher ratio of residues more sensitive to oxidative damage in the eukaryotic/
cyanobacterial proteins compared to their bacterial orthologs. These results led us to hypothesize an archaean atmosphere
