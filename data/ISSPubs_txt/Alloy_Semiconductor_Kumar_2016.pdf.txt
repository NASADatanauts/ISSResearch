InGaSb ternary alloys were grown from GaSb (111)A and B faces (Ga and Sb faces) under microgravity conditions on board the
International Space Station by a vertical gradient freezing method. The dissolution process of the Ga and Sb faces of GaSb and
orientation-dependent growth properties of InGaSb were analysed. The dissolution of GaSb(1 1 1)B was greater than that of (1 11)A,
which was found from the remaining undissolved seed and feed crystals. The higher dissolution of the Sb face was explained based
on the number of atoms at that face, and its bonding with the next atomic layer. The growth interface shape was almost ﬂat in both
cases. The indium composition in both InGaSb samples was uniform in the radial direction and it gradually decreased along
the growth direction because of segregation. The growth rate of InGaSb from GaSb (111)B was found to be higher than that of
GaSb (111)A because of the higher dissolution of GaSb (111)B.
