Abstract—Reliability and credibility of the results of measurements of the ﬂuxes of protons and heavy ions
of solar energetic particles, carried out with various experimental methods, are studied, as well as the methods
of description of obtained data with various model functions of energy spectra. We analyze the results of mea—
suring the ﬂuxes of heavy ions of solar cosmic rays with the use of solid—state track detectors in the experi—
ments Astro (April 1981, Salyut—6 spacecraft) and Platan—3 (1988—1989, Mir orbital station) and compare
them with the results of experiments VLET and CRT made onboard the IMP—8 satellite. Special emphasis is
made on the analysis of results obtained with instruments SIS and ULEIS (ACE), and of results of measuring
the ﬂuxes of helium ions by the instrument EPEAD on GOES satellites. We also discuss the problem of ﬁtting
experimental data about SCR ﬂuxes by different functions of energy (momentum, velocity) of particles. Such
an approximation is a basis for interpreting the results of measurements. Numerous systematic errors are
revealed that are typical for the results of measurements of the ﬂuxes of SCR particles, performed with differ—

ent instruments onboard Earth—orbiting satellites and other space vehicles.
