Abstract
The National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) performs
organ dosimetry and risk assessment for astronauts using model—normalized
measurements of the radiation ﬁelds encountered in space. To determine
the radiation ﬁelds in an organ or tissue of interest, particle transport
calculations are performed using self—shielding distributions generated With
the computer program CAMERA to represent the human body. CAMERA
mathematically traces linear rays (or path lengths) through the computerized
anatomical man (CAM) phantom, a computational stylized model developed
in the early 1970s With organ and body proﬁles modeled using solid shapes
and scaled to represent the body morphometry 0f the 1950 50th percentile
(PCTL) Air Force male. With the increasing use of voxel phantoms
in medical and health physics, a conversion from a mathematical—based
to a voxel—based ray—tracing algorithm is warranted. In this study, the
voxel—based ray tracer (VOBRaT) is introduced to ray trace voxel phantoms
using a modiﬁed version of the algorithm ﬁrst proposed by Siddon (1985
Med. Phys. 12 252—5). After validation, VOBRAT is used to evaluate
variations in body self—shielding distributions for NASA phantoms and siX
University of Florida (UF) hybrid phantoms, scaled to represent the 5th,
50th, and 95th PCTL male and female astronaut body morphometries, Which
have Changed considerably since the inception of CAM. These body self—
shielding distributions are used to generate organ dose equivalents and

1. Introduction
The space radiation environment differs greatly from anything encountered on Earth. The
types of radiation encountered are diverse, ranging from electrons to protons to uranium ions.
Due to their penetration and high level of energy deposition, three Classes of radiation are of
particular concern: geomagnetically trapped radiations, galactic cosmic rays (GCR), and solar
particle events (SPEs). Geomagnetically trapped radiations, Which are of concern in low—Earth
orbit (LEO), mostly consist of electrons and protons, although protons are of greater concern
in space radiation shielding studies due to their ability to penetrate shielding (NCRP 2002).
The spectrum of geomagnetically trapped protons, With a maximum energy of about 700 MeV,
is modulated by the solar activity level and is a function of altitude and orbital inclination.
GCR consist of ions ranging from protons to uranium ions, although the heaViest ions With a
signiﬁcant abundance are those of iron nuclei (NCRP 2000, 2006). GCR can have energies
exceeding 10 MeV n‘l, and are well represented by a spectrum With a broad peak around
300 to 700 MeV 11—1 (NCRP 2006, O’Neill 2006). GCR are modulated by solar activity, and
in LEO, the spectrum is further modiﬁed by Earth’s magnetic ﬁeld. SPEs, Which consist of
protons With energies up to 1 GeV, are sporadic but can result in high doses due to the high
particle ﬂuence associated With these events (Ballarini er al 2004, Wilson et al 1999, Zapp
er al 2002).

For National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) astronaut dosimetry, Monte
Carlo simulation of radiation dose is not implemented in the operational realm, in part due to
the complexity of transport of the energetic particles through astronaut and vehicle models and
historical limitations in computing power. Instead, the radiation transport problem is reduced
to one dimension through the use of ray tracing. Two radiation transport codes are used to
generate dose proﬁles as a function of aluminum equivalent thickness (representing vehicle
shielding) and water equivalent thickness (phantom self—shielding). The ﬁrst is HZETRN,
Which is used to analyze GCR dose, and the second is BRYNTRN, Which is used to analyze
proton dose from SPEs and geomagnetically trapped protons (Wilson et al 1991b).

To return dose at a particular point, the ray trace results for the phantom self—shielding and
vehicle shielding are combined With the tabular output from HZETRN and BRYNTRN for a
given space radiation environment. NASA has developed a specialized program, CAMERA, to
generate path length distributions With its high—ﬁdelity mathematical phantom, computerized
anatomical man (CAM) (Billings and Yucker 1973). However, the present trend in phantom
development is away from stylized and toward voxel—based phantoms or even ‘hybrid’
phantoms, Which combine the ﬂexibility of stylized phantoms and the anatomical realism
of voxel—based phantoms. The purpose of this study is twofold: (1) demonstrate that the
hybrid phantoms developed at the University of Florida (UF) (Lee et al 2010) are compatible
With the current operational framework of NASA astronaut dosimetry, and (2) demonstrate
the effect of differences in body morphometry on organ self—shielding distributions and organ
dose equivalent and effective dose.

2. Materials and methods

2.1. CAM and CAMERA

CAM was ﬁrst developed by Martin Marietta Corporation for space radiation protection
purposes (Kase 1970). The initial iteration of CAM was written to be used with the Modiﬁed
Elemental Volume Dose Program (MEVDP), and was to be constructed through Boolean logic
using siX shapes: hexahedron, right Circular cylinder, sphere, hemisphere, truncated 0r pristine
right Circular cone, and truncated 0r pristine ellipsoid with truncation from up to two planes
(Liley and Hamilton 1971). The goal was to develop a computational phantom representing
the1950 50th percentile (PCTL) Air Force male, with 0.1 inch accuracy in length dimensions
and 10% accuracy in total body weight (Kase 1970). The result was a highly stylized model
with over 2400 surfaces comprising 1100 solid composite parts.

After the initial development of CAM in 1970, reﬁnements were made for integration into
a new program, CAMERA. These reﬁnements included explicit bone marrow site modeling
by adding surfaces within the bone regions consisting of an offset of the external bone contour
and an update to the geometry system to integrate a more efﬁcient ray—tracing algorithm
(Billings and Yucker 1973). The two ray selection methods from MEVDP were retained:
random and systematic. The details of the calculation of ray selection can be found in the
MEVDP Technical Report (Liley and Hamilton 1971). For the present study, the systematic
ray selection method with 512 rays was used, as this mirrors the way in which the NASA body
self—shielding distributions were generated (Billings and Yucker 1973).

For an appropriate comparison with the UP hybrid phantoms, it was necessary to voxelize
CAM. Voxelization was performed using CAMERA, in a manner similar to that of a previous
study by Slaba er al (2009). An input ﬁle was prepared with dose points consisting of an
array of points 0.2 cm apart in all three directions. CAMERA, which speciﬁes the material
tag of every dose point, was run using the generated input ﬁle, and the material tags were
subsequently extracted from this ﬁle. A binary ﬁle with the material tags was created using a
MATLAB (The MathWorks, Natick, MA) script for later ray tracing. In addition to voxelizing
the model, a layer of skin was added to CAM, and skeletal spongiosa regions were retagged
so that site—speciﬁc spongiosa compositions could be used. Spongiosa is the mixture of red
marrow, yellow marrow and bone trabeculae located within cortical bone.

A female version of CAM, known as the computerized anatomical female (CAF) model
was constructed in the early 1990s. CAF was the scaled version of CAM, with a scaling factor
of 0.92 in each dimension (Yucker and Huston 1990). The penis and testes were removed from
CAM, and breast, ovary, and uterus models were added. For this analysis, a CAF model was
not available. However, since CAF is a scaled version of CAM, the CAP body self—shielding
distributions can be approximated by multiplying the values from CAM by the 0.92 scaling
factor. For the female organs, the body self—shielding distributions are as taken from the
NASA operational risk code (NASA 2009b). Variable scaling was later implemented with
CAP; however, only the hip region deviated from the 0.92 scaling factor — 1.04 lateral and
0.94 anterior—posterior (Yucker 1992). This results in a maximum of 5% underestimation of
ray length for this region.

2.2. UF hybridphantoms

First—generation computerized anatomic models are based on three—dimensional mathematical
surface equations (stylized phantoms), while second—generation models are created through
segmented medical images (vexel phantoms). The UF hybrid phantom is a third—generation
human anatomic model that combines the best features of eaCh—anatomic ﬂexibility, as

afforded by stylized phantoms, as well as anatomic realism, as afforded by vexel phantoms.
The CAM phantom (ANS 2005) and the UP hybrid phantom are displayed in ﬁgure 1.

To construct the UP Hybrid Phantom Series, organs in previously acquired computed
tomography (CT) images were segmented. The contour ﬁles were converted to polygon mesh
ﬁles, and then imported into the NURBS—based solid modeling program Rhinoceros (McNeel
North America, Seattle, WA). Here, non—uniform rational B—spline (NURBS) models were
created from the polygon mesh ﬁles. Some organs, namely the brain, lungs, and extrathoracic
airways, were left in polygon mesh due to the inherent difﬁculty of modeling these organs
with smooth surfaces. In addition, stylized representations were used for organs such as the
eyeballs, urinary bladder, eye lens, tongue, and seX—speciﬁc organs, due to the accuracy of
simple shapes in representing these organs (Lee et al 2010). The organ masses were matched
to the values reported in ICRP Report 89 (ICRP 2002), while the organ densities were matched
to the values reported in ICRU Report 46 (ICRU 1992). Internal organs and exterior body
dimensions were matched to reference values to within 1% and 4%, respectively (Lee et al
2010). The UF series includes Children of ﬁve ages, as well as the ICRP reference adult male
and female, which were used in the present study.

Understanding the impact of body size on body self—shielding required the use of target
anthropometric parameters for scaling of the UP hybrid adult male and female. The most
recent update to NASA’s anthropometric design criteria are listed in NASA CXP 70024
Revision C, Constellation Program Human—Systems Integration Requirements document
(NASA 2009a). This document presents a gender—pooled set of anthropometric parameters,
and thus it was necessary to consider data from the older NASA—STD—3000, Man—Systems

Integration Standards document (MSIS) (NASA 1995). Anthropometric data were provided

for 5th PCTL, 50th PCTL, and 95th PCTL for 40—year—old American males and 40—year—old

J apanese females. As stated in the NASA MSIS, the anthropometric parameters are presented

for these populations since the astronaut population is being drawn increasingly from the

general world population instead of the United States military population (NASA 1995).

While male astronaut height and weight data compare well with the data for the 40—year—old

American male, the female astronaut heights and weights were larger than the data for the

40—year—old J apanese female. A comparison of the heights and weights for the 5th PCTL,

50th PCTL, and 95th PCTL male and female astronauts, along with the heights and weights

of CAM and CAF, are shown in table 1.

To create the set of UP hybrid phantoms representing the 5th PCTL, 50th PCTL, and
95th PCTL male and female astronauts, ﬁrst the anthropometric parameters for the 50th PCTL
male and female as listed in the NASA MSIS were matched. Uniform scaling factors for the
males were then derived for the 5th PCTL and 95th PCTL males based on body measurements
and total body mass. For the females, all of the phantoms had to be scaled, since the 50th
PCTL female as deﬁned in the NASA MSIS did not coincide with the 50th PCTL female
astronaut. Here, scaling in the z—direction was based on stature, while scaling in the xy plane
was performed to match total body mass. This scaling methodology ensured that the body
self—shielding distributions would be consistent for all ray directions. Once the phantoms were
scaled appropriately, they were voxelized using an in—house MATLAB code. Voxel dimensions
were speciﬁed as 0.2 cm X 0.2 cm X 0.2 cm, which allows for a reasonable skin thickness
without resulting in an unreasonably large ﬁle size (the phantom ﬁle sizes ranged from 23 MB
to 49 MB). The UF hybrid adult male—scaled phantoms (UFHADMS, UFHADM50, and
UFHADM95) are displayed in ﬁgure 2(a), and the UP hybrid adult female—scaled phantoms
(UFHADFS, UFHADF50, and UFHADF95) are displayed in ﬁgure 2(b).

2.3. Voxel-based ray tracer

T0 ray trace the phantoms subsequent to voxelization, a Visual Basic (Microsoft Corporation,
Redmond, WA) code, voxel—based ray tracer (VOBRaT), was written. As inputs, the program
requires the number of voxels in each direction and the voxel resolution in each direction.
From these parameters, it creates an empty array, which is then populated using the voxel
array deﬁnition ﬁle. The phantom type (UF hybrid adult male, UF hybrid adult female, or
CAM) is also requested. The phantom type indicates which phantom material lockup tables
(LUTs) should be used.

Two LUTs required for ray tracing are mass density and 50 MeV proton range. These
two quantities are utilized in VoBRaT to standardize all rays to linear path lengths in water,
as required for later use with tabular data generated by HZETRN and BRYNTRN. The mass
densities for the UP phantom materials were taken from ICRU Report 46 (ICRU 1992), while
the densities for CAM were taken from the material deﬁnitions of the CAM Model report
(Billings and Yucker 1973). The 50 MeV proton ranges for the UP phantom materials were
calculated using the program SRIM—2008 (Ziegler er al 2008). Values from these LUTs are
used for converting all materials to ‘water equivalent’. Once the voxel array deﬁnition ﬁle is
loaded and the phantom type is speciﬁed, the density LUT is used to calculate the total mass
of the phantom as
N
m = Z dxdydz, (1)
1. Pi
where i is the voxel index; N is the total number of voxels; dx, dy, and dZ are the voxel
resolutions in the x, y, and z directions, respectively; and ,0,- is the density of voxel i.

The ray—tracing procedure requires the speciﬁcation of both a dose point and a source
point. For this study, dose points were randomly selected (an exception to this statement is
the manual selection of some dose points within CAM/CAF due to a lack of an organ being
explicitly segmented in these phantoms). The random selection procedure for the organs other
than the BFO is straightforward: the indices of all voxels comprising the organ are determined,
and the Visual Basic random number generator is used to Choose a row number, which indicates
a set of coordinates to set as a dose point. Once the row is Chosen, it is removed from the
array to prevent the possibility of repeating a dose point. As an error—preventing measure, if
the number of voxels comprising an organ is less than the desired number of random points,
the user is notiﬁed and every voxel is ray traced. The BFO, on the other hand, is a distributed,
inhomogeneous organ. In the UP skeletal model, 13 skeletal sites are deﬁned as containing
active marrow. These sites are the

o Cervical vertebra

o ClaViCle

o Cranium

o Proximal femur

o Proximal humerus

o Lumbar vertebra

o Mandible

o Pelvis

0 Rib

o Sacrum

o Scapula

o Sternum

o Thoracic vertebra.
In a manner similar to that used for the other organs, the indices of all voxels comprising each
skeletal site are determined. The ‘desired’ number of BFO dose points is entered, and the
number of dose points selected from each skeletal site is apportioned based on the relative
proportion of active (red) marrow in each skeletal site (ICRP 1995). Random voxel selection
is performed as described previously. Dose point selection is completed when the Cartesian
coordinates are calculated from the voxel indices.

Once the dose points are selected, the source point selection process occurs. First, the
distance from the dose point to each corner of the voxel array is determined. The radius of

"
"9","1678 A A Bahadori et al
the sampling sphere is taken to be the maximum distance plus 1 cm to ensure that the entire
phantom is enveloped by the sampling sphere. In VOBRaT, the direction cosines used by
CAMERA for 512 rays are hard—Wired into the code as a systematic option; future versions
of the ray tracer Will encompass the entire selection process to allow for different numbers
of systematically selected rays. The random ray selection process from CAMERA is also an
option for calculating direction cosines. The source point coordinates are calculated as

x5 xd 04

[k] = |:)’d:| +1” [ﬂ] , (2)

ZS Zd y
Where xd, yd, and zd are the dose point coordinates; r is the radius of the sampling sphere; and
04, ,6, and y are the direction cosines. In order to ensure that division by zero does not occur
later in the ray—tracing process, if the coordinates of the dose point and source point are equal
in any dimension, the source point coordinate is offset by 1 ,um.

The ray—tracing algorithm employed by VOBRaT is based on that previously outlined by
Siddon (1985). For a given source point and dose point, the bounds of intersected planes
and the corresponding parametric values for the ray are calculated using the plane indices of
the vexels containing the source and dose points and their relative positions. The Cartesian
coordinates and indices of the ﬁrst intersected vexel at the entrance to the voxel array are found
using the appropriate ray parametric value. Next, the parameter step size in the x—dimension,
Which is constant due to the ordered nature of the set of orthogonal planes, is calculated as

djf = —dx . (3)

lxs _ xd I

The parameter step sizes in the other directions are similarly calculated. Starting With the
parametric intersection of the ray and the vexel array, a do—loop is used to iteratively ﬁnd
the next parametric intersection value, look up the density and range of 50 MeV protons for
the current vexel, and calculate the parametric length through the current vexel as

11- = (a1 — a2>piRwRi—1, (4)
Where all is the parametric value for intersection With the current vexel, a2 is the parametric
value for intersection With the next vexel, ,0,- is the density of the current vexel, Rw is the
range of 50 MeV protons in water, and Rl- is the range of 50 MeV protons in the material
comprising vexel i (Ponomarev er al 2007). The do—loop is terminated When a2 is greater than
unity, indicating that the dose point is located in the current vexel. The ‘remainder’ parametric
length from the last voxel is then calculated. Finally, the total radiological path length in water
is calculated as

J
1H = r 211-, (5)
l

Where J is the total number of vexels intersected by the given ray. This procedure is performed
in two nested for—loops; the outer loop addresses each dose point, While the inner loop addresses
each source point. For each run of VOBRaT, the direction cosines and resulting radiological
path length in water are written to an Excel (Microsoft Corporation, Redmond, WA) ﬁle for
later use.
2.4. Space radiation environments
The space radiation environment is time varying and complex; the types of exposure scenarios
can be roughly divided into geomagnetically trapped protons, GCR, and SPE. Geomagnetically
trapped radiations are present in the Van Allen belts due to planetary magnetic ﬁeld interactions

With charged particles of extra—planetary origin. There are two main belt regions: the inner
and outer belts. The inner belt consists mostly of protons, Whereas the outer belt consists
mostly of electrons (NRC 2006). LEO missions are ﬂown Within the inner belt, and so
the dose contribution from geomagnetically trapped protons must be evaluated. The APS
geomagnetically trapped proton model With the 1965 International Geomagnetic Reference
Field model for earth’s magnetic ﬁeld (NRC 2008, Wilson et al 1997) is used in this work.
Proton spectra for altitude ranging from 300 to 630 km and for orbital inclinations of 28.50 and
51.60 are available. The solar activity level also has an impact on the geomagnetically trapped
proton spectrum: at solar maximum, the proton levels are lower than at solar minimum due
to atmospheric interactions (NRC 2006). The proton spectrum for an altitude of 351.5 km
(190 nm) and 51.60 inclination at solar minimum Will be used to represent a worst—Case scenario
for geomagnetically trapped proton levels for an orbit similar to that of the current orbit of
188. This proton spectrum is displayed in ﬁgure 3(a).

GCR consist of a spectrum of protons and heavy ions representing a low—ﬂux background
level of slowly varying radiation in space. Protons comprise the majority of GCR, With helium
ions being the next most abundant species at around 10% 0f the total (NRC 2008). A much
smaller fraction of GCR consists of ions heavier than helium; iron ions are the heaviest nuclei
With a signiﬁcant abundance, but GCR is modeled With small cobalt and nickel contributions
as well (NCRP 2006). The heavy ion component of GCR is a problem in space radiation
shielding due to fragmentation effects and the high linear energy transfer (LET) nature of
these highly energetic particles. GCR ﬂuxes are modulated by solar activity, With maximum
values occurring at solar minimum and minimum values occurring at solar maximum (NRC

"
"11","1680 A A Bahadori et al
2008). For this study, the GCR spectra and composition at the 1977 solar minimum, which
represent the highest observed GCR ﬁuence rates, are used neglecting the effects of Earth’s
magnetic ﬁeld and solid angle shielding. This is the worst—case scenario, and results in much
larger radiation doses than for simulations and measurements of LEO GCR as referenced in
previous studies (Cucinotta er al 2008, Reitz er al 2009). Energy spectra for hydrogen, helium,
oxygen and iron components of GCR at the 1977 solar minimum are shown in ﬁgure 3(b).
These spectra are taken from the distribution of HZETRN 2005 (Wilson et al 2006).

SPEs result from spurious solar activity, which accelerates a large number of protons
with high energies away from the surface of the sun. These events generally last on the
order of hours or days, and have been shown to result in high doses for high ﬁuence events,
especially for small shielding thicknesses (Simonsen er al 1992, Ballarini er al 2006). SPEs
are of particular concern outside of LEO, since the geomagnetic ﬁeld deﬂects most of the
ions accelerated toward Earth during these events. Unlike geomagnetically trapped protons
and GCR, the occurrence of SPE is not well forecasted with current capabilities. Despite the
fact that SPEs contain heavier ions, the relative abundances of these ions are many orders
of magnitude less than that of protons and hence are neglected in simulation. SPE proton
energy spectra vary in terms of ﬁuence and shape; ‘soft’ spectra are biased toward lower
energy protons, while ‘hard’ spectra have protons of very high energies. Soft spectra are of
concern for lighter shielding conﬁgurations, while hard spectra are of concern for heavier
shielding conﬁgurations. Historically, a number of very high ﬁuence events have been used to
represent the most intense SPEs. The three high ﬁuence events of interest for this work are the
October 1989 SPE, the August 1972 SPE, and the February 1956 SPE, which represent two
‘soft’ spectra and one ‘hard’ spectrum, respectively. The proton energy spectra for these three
events are shown in ﬁgure 3(C). These spectra are taken from the BRYNTRN code (Wilson
et al 1989).

2.5. HZETRN and BRYNTRN transport and dosimetry

In the past, full Monte Carlo radiation transport was not used, due in part to computing
limitations. Radiation transport was addressed by reducing the problem to one dimension
and using deterministic methods. The program BRYNTRN was written to transport
geomagnetically trapped protons and SPE (Wilson et al 1989), while the program HZETRN
was written to transport GCR (Wilson et al 1991a). BRYNTRN and HZETRN transport the
incident particles through one—dimensional slabs of aluminum, representing shielding external
to the astronaut, and water, representing astronaut self—shielding.

Concurrent with transport, both BRYNTRN and HZETRN calculate the dose and dose
equivalent as a function of slab thickness. The dose at a depth of x within the slab is calculated
as

00
D(x) = 23/0 sj(E)c1>J-(x, E)dE, (6)
J
where Sj(E) is the stopping power for the particle type j with an energy E, and CIDJ- (x, E ) is
the ﬂuence for the particle type j with an energy E at a slab depth x. The dose equivalent is
calculated as
00
H(x) = 2/0 Qj(E)sj(E)c1>J-(x,E) dE, (7)
J
where QJ-(E) is the quality factor for the particle type j at an energy E (Wilson et al 1991b).
The quality factor is taken to be a function of LET using the ICRP Report 60 (ICRP 1991)
deﬁnition (table 2).

Once the dose, D, and the dose equivalent, H, are determined as a function of depth,
the ray trace results are used to determine the organ dose equivalent. The dose equivalent
for each ray length is found and the average over all of the rays is computed; this is valid
since the solid angle represented by each of the 512 rays is approximately the same. In
practice, dose and dose equivalent are outputted by BRYNTRN and HZETRN in the form of
a two—dimensional matrix representing depths of aluminum for external shielding and depths
of water for body self—shielding. Therefore, two interpolations are performed: one over the
vehicle ray distribution, and another over the phantom distribution. For simplicity, the vehicle
shielding will be assumed to be a spherical shell in this study.

3. Results

3.1. VOBRaT validation

Validation of VoBRaT was completed to ensure that the calculations were being performed
as expected. The ﬁrst case tested for validation was a 30 cm diameter unit density water
sphere surrounded by vacuum. The dose point was speciﬁed to be the center of the sphere.
For the 512 ray systematic distribution, the mean radiological path length in water was found
to be 14.984 cm (0.11% error), with a standard deviation of 0.069 cm or 0.46%. The time
required for the calculation was 0.2 ms per ray on a Dell Precision T3400 workstation with an
Intel Core 2 Duo E4600 2.4 GHZ processor and 3.25 GB of RAM; thus, the time required for
ray tracing would not preclude the use of many dose points to represent an organ for future
analyses. The VoBRaT performed well for this test case, considering that both the absolute
standard deviation and the absolute error were fractions of the voxel resolution, and that the
relative standard deviation and relative error were small.

Next, VoBRaT was validated using an actual dose point within CAM. First, CAMERA
was used to generate the body self—shielding distribution for the right eye lens. For the same
dose point, the body self—shielding distribution was generated using VoBRaT. Figure 4(a)
shows the two distributions. Excellent agreement was observed, especially above path lengths
of 1 cm of water. The agreement below path lengths of 1 cm of water is attributable to artifacts
from the voxelization process, since the surfaces comprising CAM were no longer smooth.
A heart dose point was also evaluated, to ensure that VoBRaT would perform well relative to
CAMERA for a deeper—seated organ. The results are shown in ﬁgure 4(b), and once again
indicate very good agreement. The validation results from the 30 cm unit density water sphere,
along with the validation results from two CAM dose points, indicated that the VoBRaT was
operating properly and could faithfully produce body self—shielding distributions for voxel
phantoms.

3.2. Phantom ray tracing
Once the capability for creating body self—shielding distributions for voxel phantoms was
realized, the impact of body morphometry on the body self—shielding distributions was

investigated. Important organs for the NASA method of the calculation of effective dose
include the gonads, colon, and female breast. Important organs for deterministic effects
include the BFO, skin, and eye lens. The body self—shielding distributions for all organs
except for those not explicitly segmented in CAM (eye lens, oral mucosa, esophagus, salivary
glands, adrenals, extrathoracic airways (ET) region, gallbladder, thymus, prostate, breasts,
ovaries, and uterus) were generated by randomly sampling points within the organ. Five
hundred points were used for all organs except the skin, BFO, and muscle, unless these
organs comprised less than 500 voxels; for these highly distributed organs, 8000 points were
used. The resulting body self—shielding distributions for speciﬁc organs of interest in NASA
dosimetry (gonads, colon, female breasts, BFO, skin, and eye lenses) are shown in ﬁgures 5(a)
through (g). Results from the voxelized CAM and CAF are shown for comparison. Body
self—shielding distributions for the entire complement of organs considered are available in
electronic annex A available at stacks.i0p.0rg/PMB/56/l67l/mmedia.
3.3. Organ dosimetry
Once the body self—shielding distributions were generated for the phantoms, the results from
BRYNTRN and HZETRN were used to derive the overall organ dose equivalents. Simpliﬁed
vehicle shielding distributions were assumed: space suit shielding at 0.5 g CID—2 aluminum
equivalent, a thinly shielded pressure vessel (PV) shielding at 2 g CID—2 aluminum equivalent,
and a shelter area within a spacecraft at 10 g CID—2 aluminum equivalent. These hypothetical
shielding thicknesses are similar to those used in previous studies (Simonsen er al 1992, Hoff
er al 2004, Ballarini er al 2006, Slaba er al 2009). The body self—shielding ray thicknesses
were interpolated over the depth dose distribution at these aluminum equivalent shielding
thicknesses in order to return organ dose equivalents. Organ dose equivalent rates for trapped
protons and GCR in PV shielding are shown in ﬁgures 6 and 7, respectively, while organ
dose equivalent results for the August 1972 SPE for suit shielding and shelter shielding are
shown in ﬁgure 8. To more explicitly illustrate the relationship between anatomical modeling
and organ dose equivalent, the fractional difference between the organ dose equivalents for
a phantom of interest and the 50th PCTL UF phantom was calculated as the ratio of the
phantom of interest organ dose equivalent to the 50th PCTL UF organ dose equivalent minus
unity. Fractional difference results for trapped protons and GCR in PV shielding are shown
in ﬁgures 9 and 10, respectively, while fractional difference results for the August 1972 SPE

rates/organ dose equivalents and fractional differences for all combinations of space radiation
environment and vehicular shielding are available in the electronic annexes B and C available
at stacks.i0p.0rg/PMB/56/1671/mmedia, respectively.

Also of signiﬁcance to space dosimetry is the average radiation quality factor, calculated
as the quotient of the organ dose equivalent and the organ absorbed dose. Tables of average
radiation quality factor for the phantom organs are shown for the February 1956 SPE radiation
environment With space suit shielding (table 3), GCR radiation environment with PV shielding
(table 4), and the August 1972 SPE radiation environment with shelter shielding (table 5). The
average radiation quality factor varies as a function of organ location and, to a lesser extent,
phantom type. The average quality factors for the SPE environments are smaller in magnitude,
and exhibit less overall variation, than the average quality factors for the GCR environment.
These radiation quality factors compare well With calculated quality factors for protons and
GCR exposures as Cited in the previous study by Badhwar er al (2002).

3.4. Eﬂective dose analysis
The effective dose is used by NASA as an indicator of radiation risk. In this study, an effective
dose is approximated using organ dose equivalents and gender—speciﬁc tissue weighting factors
similar to those recommended in ICRP Report 60 (ICRP 1991) (table 6). Although updated
tissue weighting factors are available from the ICRP, it is current NASA policy to use
ICRP Publication 60 tissue weighting factors in accordance With NCRP Report No. 132
recommendation (NCRP 2000). It is recognized that the male weighting factors, With zero
weighting factor for the male breast, sum to 0.95, While the female weighting factors sum to
unity. The effective dose rates as a function of vehicular shielding for the eight phantoms are
shown for trapped protons and free—space GCR in ﬁgures 12(a) and (b), respectively. Similarly,
the effective doses as a function of vehicular shielding for the eight phantoms are shown for the
August 1972 SPE in ﬁgure 12(c). Also shown in ﬁgure 12(C) are example age—speciﬁc effective
dose career limits as given in NASA’s Space F light Human System Standard for comparison
(NASA 2007). These effective dose career limits correspond to the NASA permissible
exposure level of 3% radiation exposure induced death, and are shown for ages at exposure of

4. Discussion
As previously stated, the results of the three validation tests indicate that VOBRaT can produce
body self—shielding distributions in voxel phantoms. The results compare favorably to those
from CAMERA, which performs mathematical ray tracing. The time required for ray tracing
is minimal 011 a Dell Precision T3400 workstation With an Intel Core 2 Duo E4600 2.4 GHZ
processor and 3.25 GB of RAM, and so operationally the generation of astronaut—speeiﬁc body
self—shielding distributions would not greatly add to the time required to evaluate astronaut risk.
The ability to ray trace voxel phantoms allows for the possibility of creating astronaut—speeiﬁc
phantoms in order to evaluate risk due to radiation in human spaceﬂight.

Overall, the body self—shielding distributions for the UF phantoms Clearly exhibit the
trend of increasing body self—shielding for larger phantoms regardless of organ location. The
differences between the distributions for the UF phantoms and the NASA phantoms result
from a combination of anthropometric modeling and overall body size. These differences
are most pronounced for females in the abdominal region; since CAF is a scaled version of
CAM, the anthropometric modeling between the two phantoms differs little, and so CAF has
attributes of a male morphometry. In contrast, the UF female phantoms are based directly on
female morphometry, and so there are greater differences between the UF male and female
phantoms. This is Why in many instances the body self—shielding distribution for CAF tracks
with CAM and the UF male phantoms.

While an overall trend of phantom size and body self—shielding is observed, the impact
of variations in body morphometry is not consistent over the entire phantom: the closer to the
center of mass of the phantoms, the more variation is observed among the body self—shielding
distributions. Greater differences are observed for dose points With more phantom self—
shielding. An instance of this observation is found When comparing the body self—shielding
distributions for the colon (ﬁgure 5(C)) and the skin (ﬁgure 5(f)). The ﬁnding that differences

in deep organs are enhanced relative to differences in shallow organs can be explained by the
relative position of the body With respect to the dose point. For a dose point on the periphery
of the body, a smaller fractional solid angle about that dose point is subtended by the torso.
An exception to this observation is the eye lens (ﬁgure 5(g)). This organ is very small and
located on the periphery of the body. Since the organ is small and thus comprises few vexels,
it is difﬁcult to adequately sample the organ. When an organ is under—sampled, the effects
of small differences in shielding around that organ are artiﬁcially enhanced. This explains
the large differences in body self—shielding distributions between UFHADF5 and UFHADFSO
and the rest of the phantoms at small ray thicknesses.

Organ dosimetry results follow logically from the body self—shielding results. Larger
phantoms Which have more body self—shielding have lower organ dose equivalents than their
smaller counterparts. This is eXhibited Clearly for organ dose equivalent rates and organ
dose equivalents in ﬁgures 6 through 8 and for fractional differences in ﬁgures 9 through 11.
In addition, the differences in anatomical modeling (and dose point selection in the case
of organs speciﬁcally mentioned in section 3.2) between the NASA phantoms and the UP

phantoms result in differences in organ dose equivalents. An example of this is the thyroid.
The CAM and CAF thyroids are much more lightly shielded (primarily due to the proximity
of the thyroid t0 the surface of the neck) than the UP phantom thyroids, and so a much larger
thyroid dose equivalent is observed for these two phantoms. In comparison, the skin organ
dose equivalents and organ dose equivalent rates are largely insensitive to phantom size and
anatomical shielding. Differences in small intestine dose equivalent between the UP males
and CAM are larger than differences in this quantity between the UP females and CAF; this is
a result of the modeling of the intestines in CAM and CAF as a region of low density (0.457
g cm_3) material. In the UP phantoms, a tubular intestinal structure is used. For the males,
the lower density results in a smaller amount of self—shielding and hence a larger organ dose
equivalent for CAM. For the females, however, this density effect is partially offset by the
differences in abdominal morphometry between the UP females and CAF.

The degree to Which size and anatomical modeling affect dose differences is dependent
upon the space radiation spectrum utilized. For space radiation environments with higher
penetrability, such as GCR and the February 1956 SPE, the dose differences observed are
much lower than for space radiation environments With lower penetrability, such as the

October 1989 SPE and the August 1972 SPE. Also, dose differences tend to decrease for
increasing vehicular shielding. This is shown in ﬁgure 11, as the fractional differences among
the phantoms decrease When shielding is increased from space suit to storm shelter. The effect
of shielding on organ dose equivalent is very pronounced for the August 1972 SPE (ﬁgure 8).
Effective doses exhibit a trend similar to that of the organ dose equivalents: decreasin g With
increasing phantom size (ﬁgure 12). The slope of this inverse relationship is dependent on both
the space radiation environment and the vehicular shielding. For all but the softest radiation
spectra, CAM and CAF tend to underestimate effective doses for the smaller phantoms and
overestimate effective doses for the larger phantoms. For soft radiation spectra such as the
August 1972 SPE, CAM overestimates effective dose for all three UF male phantoms because
of high gonad dose equivalent. For this spectrum, it is seen that for a PV shielding, the career
effective dose limit for a 55 —year—old male would not be exceeded if the UP phantom is used to
represent the astronaut, While it would be exceeded if CAM is used to represent the astronaut.
Effective doses observed in this study are similar to those reported in a recent study by Kim
et al for similar radiation environments (Kim et al 2010).

Although the results of this research exhibit the trend of decreasing dose With increasing
body size, two important points need to be emphasized: (1) this general trend may not

dominate differences in dose, and (2) the proj ected radiation dose resulting from an assessment
including body size factors should not be used as a determining factor in astronaut selection
for speciﬁc missions.

5. Conclusions

The ray—tracing program, VoBRaT, was validated by ray tracing a 30 cm unit density water
sphere, and ray tracing a voxelized version of CAM for two different dose points. VoBRaT
was found to operate relatively quickly; 512 rays required much less than 1 min of CPU
time on a Dell Precision T3400 workstation with an Intel Core 2 Duo E4600 2.4 GHZ
processor and 3.25 GB of RAM. These results indicate that the UP hybrid phantoms are
compatible with the NASA astronaut dosimetry operational framework. This ﬁnding could
lead to the incorporation of astronaut—dependent phantoms, based on a standard grid of
height and weight percentiles, or astronaut—speciﬁc phantoms, based on actual astronaut
anthropometrics. Computed tomography or magnetic resonance imaging, if available from a
previous occupational or medical study, could also be used for direct voxel—based phantom
creation. Body morphometry was found to affect the body self—shielding distributions, with
larger individuals having more self—shielding for a given organ. This effect was greater for
dose points toward the abdominal region and toward the center of the body, which is accounted
for by the fractional solid angle subtended by a signiﬁcant portion of the body. Differences
in this general trend (when comparing the body self—shielding distributions for the NASA
phantoms and those for the UP phantoms) occur because of differences in local anatomical
modeling, as noted in the previous section.

In terms of organ dosimetry, the trapped proton organ dose equivalent rates are signiﬁcantly
less than the GCR organ dose equivalent rates. The SPE organ dose equivalents are highly
sensitive to vehicular shielding, and for space suit type shielding can be far in excess of the
career organ dose equivalent limits. When evaluating organ dose equivalent differences amon g
the phantoms, the largest fractional differences among the phantoms are observed for light
vehicular shielding and soft radiation spectra. This same trend is observed for the effective
dose rates and effective doses. Thus, the greatest improvement in accuracy of astronaut
dosimetry through the use of size—based phantoms would be realized for soft proton spectra
(both trapped and SPE) and shielding below 10 g cm_2 aluminum equivalent.

Astronauts tend to assume a neutral body position while in spaceﬂight and ﬂuid shifts
toward the head when eXposed to micro—gravity. Articulating the phantoms used in this study
and incorporating physiological Changes that occur in a micro—gravity environment could also
impact body self—shielding distributions. Future work involves investigating the effects of
these Changes on the body self—shielding distributions and resulting organ dose equivalents.
Hybrid phantoms such as those of the UP series are ideally suited to these applications in
astronaut space dosimetry and risk assessment.
