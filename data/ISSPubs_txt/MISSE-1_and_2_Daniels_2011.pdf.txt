were determined using a mass-point leak rate technique with uncertainty analysis and showed that the performances
of the three elastomers degraded at different rates. The leak rate of XELA-SA-401 was eliminated from the study
due to its poor relative ﬂight performance. The ratio of the ram-facing t0 wake-facing leak rates was 1.2 and 2.9 for
the 80383-70 and 80899-50 compounds, respectively, indicating the former compound was not appreciably affected
by atomic oxygen while the later was. After receiving atomic oxygen ﬂuence of 1.2><1022 atoms/in.2 during ﬂight,
the leak rate of the 80899-50 was 5 times that of the 80383-70 specimens; however, the leak rate of the 80383-70

I. Introduction
Understanding the performance of elastomers after exposure to the harsh environment of space is vitally
important to spacecraft designers. Applications of polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS), CH3[Si(CH3)2O]nSi(CH3)3,
elastomers commonly include gas pressure seals in many locations within spacecraft. Amongst the most challenging
applications is the face seal of vehicle-tO-Vehicle docking systems, though seals are also used around observation
windows, ﬂuid passageways, electrical connectors, and structural joints.
Seals for joining spacecraft together are conﬁgured as face seals; therefore, they are exposed to a wide range of
environmental conditions. Ultraviolet radiation (U V) emitted directly from the Sun, combined with the albedo 0f the
Earth's and Moon's surfaces, penetrates the elastomer material and breaks the long ﬂexible molecular chains. The
resultant short inﬂexible molecules tend to be brittle and can lead to cracking when compressed. The U V also
g dissociates molecular oxygen present in the Earth’s atmosphere creating monotonic oxygen, referred to as atomic
2 oxygen (A0). Present in 10w-Earth orbit (LEO), A0 is highly reactive with the surface of elastomer seals and can
8, embrittle the surface. Though the exact mechanism of the reaction is unproven, researchers1 have hypothesized that
E the A0 displaces the methyl groups (CH3) within the repeating monomer, [Si(CH3)2O], 0f the PDMS leaving a
E higher concentration of SiOX 0n the elastomer’s surface.
g The vacuum pressure environment of outer space can alter an elastomer compound and continually change its
3 properties with exposure. The orbital nature of space ﬂight exposes the craft to an oscillating environment of direct
‘35” sunlight and shadow causing temperatures to continually cycle and vary widely; however, temperature maintenance
§ techniques may be utilized to narrow an elastomer seal’s exposure range.
g To better understand the interaction between materials and the environment of space, a series of experiments was
E. undertaken called the Materials International Space Station Experiment (MISSE). During the MISSE-6 experiment,
i select materials were placed on the outside of the International Space Station (ISS) where the compounds were
g exposed to the LEO environment. Materials studied within this body of work were exposed for 537 days. Select test
3"" specimens were pretreated in terrestrial facilities prior to proceeding to the on-orbit exposure phase of the test
Ti program to simulate a candidate adhesion mitigation technique2.
g The test specimens were divided into four lets; a select group of test specimens were exposed to simulated space
% environments in terrestrial facilities, the second and third groups were exposed on-orbit in ram-facing (i.e., facing
E towards the velocity vector) and wake-facing (i.e., facing away from the velocity vector) directions, while the
CE) remaining group was held as the control group. All of the specimens were tested to characterize their leak rate
35 performance. The results, along with their corresponding measurement uncertainties, provide designers with a better
% understanding of the durability and performance of candidate elastomers used for spacecraft sea1 applications.

2 A. Test specimens
E. The test specimens were standard ASS68A size 2-106 O-rings manufactured from three silicone elastomer
g compounds, Parker Hanniﬁn 80383-70, Parker Hanniﬁn 80899-50, and Esterline XELA-SA-401. The
Li measurements of specimen durometer, prior to any exposures, were 68.1, 36.8, and 39.4, respectively. The nominal
E dimensions are shown in Table 1.

Table 1. Nominal dimensions of the test specimens.

A characteristic of the chosen silicone elastomer compounds was that they contain minimal amounts of low
weight molecules that are released when exposed to a vacuum environment. This desirable characteristic minimizes
the amount of material that would collect on spacecraft optics, solar panels, and instruments and is achieved during
the post-cure cycle of silicone manufacture. Verifying this characteristic lends credibility that the specimens were
properly manufactured. Therefore, random samples from each batch of O-rings were veriﬁed to be low outgassing3
per ASTM E595-074, as deﬁned by having a total mass loss (TML) less than 1% and a collectible volatile
condensable material (C VCM) less than 0.1%, as shown in Table 2.

B. On-orbit exposure

The ﬂight specimens ascended into orbit attached to the MISSE 6B Passive Experiment Container (PEC) aboard
Space Shuttle ﬂight STS—123. The PEC was placed external to [SS on March 13, 2008, retrieved on September 1,
2009 for total on—orbit duration of 5 37 days, and returned to Earth aboard STS—128.

m To determine the A0 ﬂuence that irnpinged upon the rarn—facing and wake—facing surfaces, a series of Kapton®

facilities. Each facility operated under partial pressure environment of air (<200 rntorr), and the A0 plasma was
generated using a radio frequency power supply. In an attempt to have the terrestrial exposures approximate those
exposures conducted on—orbit, similar levels of terrestrial A0 ﬂuence were chosen, shown in Table 4. During the
exposure, the specimens were exposed simultaneously to a negligible amount of U V.

"4","E. Control specimens
The control specimens were surface pretreated (select samples) and mounted into their assembly at the same
time and utilizing identical procedures as those used for the on-orbit ﬂight samples. The assembly was placed in a
secure location while the ﬂight samples were exposed on-orbit and the terrestrial exposures were conducted. The
secure location was in a laboratory environment, without strict temperature or humidity control. The control
specimens were disassembled and leak rate tested in the same time period using the identical test apparatus utilized
for the ﬂight and terrestrially exposed samples.
111. Description of the test apparatus and procedures
A. Test apparatus
The leak rate of each test specimen was measured using a mass point leak rate system. The features of the mass
point leak rate system were detailed previously,6’7 but are brieﬂy discussed herein for completeness. The test
a apparatus quantiﬁed the mass of dry air that passed the seal location, including the amount of gas that was
§ transported through any leakage paths (e.g., through microcracks and at the sealing interfaces) and that which
§ permeated through the elastomer compound.
g The system consisted of a gas reservoir immersed in a water bath to moderate any temperature ﬂuctuations of the
E? gas within the closed system, as shown in Fig. 2. The temperature of the water was monitored by a resistance
5 temperature detector (RTD) with an accuracy of i0.35°F (020°C). The gas reservoir was connected to the test
8 ﬁxture containing the test specimen.
g The test ﬁxture was manufactured from stainless steel and assembled such that each seal specimen was
3 compressed to 25% of its nominal height, Fig. 3. The specimen was compressed between two ﬂat surfaces, each
g with roughness better than 16 pin (0.4 um). Dry air was used as the test gas and was supplied to the volume at the
E; test specimen’s interior. The exterior of the seal was subjected to vacuum pressure such that the targeted pressure
5 differential across the seal was 14.7 psid (101 kPa). The gas pressure of the volume was monitored using two
% pressure transducers. The pressure transducers provided 0.05% full-scale accuracy over a range of 0-20 psig (0-140
3“ kPa).
Ti To ensure that the system of supply lines from the gas reservoir to the test section was hermetic, the system was
i checked with a helium leak detection system and was found to leak no greater than 1><10'9 atm-cc/s. Hence, any
Eu: decrease in the mass of gas within the closed system was attributed to the test specimen leakage.

The leak rate of each test specimen was quantiﬁed using the mass point leak rate technique with comprehensive
error analysis. This technique returns the leak rate of test specimen, using the speciﬁc gas of interest (air), as well as
the uncertainty of the individual measurement. The technique has been presented previous1y6, but a brief synopsis is
included herein for completeness.

"5","The mass point leak rate system quantiﬁed the mass of gas within the system over time. To quantify the amount
of gas within the system, gas pressure and temperature were monitored. Assuming an ideal gas, the mass of gas
within the system was calculated from the following equation:

V
m 2 P_
RT (1)
The system mass was calculated every second resulting in a mass-time data set (ti, mi). The duration of each test
varied between ﬁve minutes and three days depending upon the rate of pressure decay.

A linear least-squares regression was computed for the data, centered about the differential pressure of interest,

resulting in a correlation,
m m(t) = alt + a0 (2)
E where a; represented the leak rate of the system and a0 was the initial mass in the volume and was of me
Q consequence. The slope of the best ﬁt line, a], provided the specimen leak rate.

3 Bias errors were determined using calibration data and precision errors were obtained through direct determination
§ methods using a 95% signiﬁcance level. However, the last three terms of Equation 3 were assumed to be zero as
3“ there were no identical error sources common to both mass and time measurements. Additionally, the precision and
Ti bias errors of the time measurement were ignored as the errors of the data acquisition were considered negligible.

% As shown in Fig.1, a series of polyimide specimens was placed at the center of each ram-facing, wake-facing,
% and control exposure assembly. The mass of each polyimide specimen was quantiﬁed before and after ﬂight to
Q determine the erosion. Using accepted techniques5’8, the effective A0 ﬂuence was determined.
§ The diameter of the polyimide specimens was 0.39 in. The weights of the ram- and wake-facing polyimide
<2: specimens were reduced from 7.1364><10'5ﬂ:2.9><10'8 and 7.1798><10'5ﬂ:3.1><10'8 lbm before ﬂight to 5.6831><10'5 and
g 7.1055><10'5 lbm after ﬂight, respectively. As shown in Table 5, the weight loss of the Kapton specimens indicated
?E that the ram-facing exposure assembly was subjected to 1.2><1022 atorns/in.2 while on-orbit, while the wake-facing
E test specimens received approximately 5% of that A0 exposure, 6.0><1020 atoms/in.2. A difference in A0 ﬂuence
5 between the ram- and wake-facing sides of the PEC was expected as previous research has shown the predominance
of A0 ﬂux occurs on the ram-facing side during 0rbit9. The control specimens were reported to have an A0 ﬂuence
—6.2><1019d:4.4><1019 atoms/in.2, indicating the experimental scatter was on the order of 10% 0f the wake-facing
ﬂuence measurement.

The errosion 0f the polyimide specimens was attributed to the impingment and reaction of A0 only, per the
ASTM standard; however, it is acknowledged that simultanous exposure to U V may have altered the errosion rate,

U V exposure, the on-orbit A0 ﬂuence measurements would be expected to be lower than reported.
2. T est Specimens

The U V exposure of the ram-facing and wake-facing exposure assemblies was quantiﬁed through numerical
analyses. The Boeing Integrated [SS TRASYS model used [SS telemetry data to compute the number of orbits, beta
angle, and solar exposure including albedo. The model provided estimates of 2620 and 1950 equivalent sun hours
(ESH) for the ram-facing and wake-facing directions, respectively.

Additionally, the temperature and vacuum conditions of the PECs were assumed to be identical. Any variation
between the test specimens exposed in ram-and wake-facing orientations was assumed to be attributable to the
resiliance of the elastomer compound and the different A0 ﬂuences.

B. Terrestrial atomic oxygen exposure
1. Kapton H®p01yimide
é Polyimide specimens, similar to those used to determine the levels of A0 exposure that occurred on-orbit, were
:' used to determine the A0 ﬂuence of the terrestrial exposures. One sample exposed simultaneously with the O-ring
i test specimens was used to quantify the A0 ﬂuence. The terrestrial A0 ﬂuences were chosen to facilitate comparison
a to on-orbit exposure levels, shown in Table 4.
2 2. T est Specimens
g During each terrestrial A0 exposure, the O-ring test specimens were exposed in close proximity to the single
3 polyimide specimen. While A0 ﬂux may depend upon the location within the terrestrial exposure chamber, the
95? distance between the O-ring specimens and the polyimide specimen was small enough that all of the samples were
é considered to have had the same A0 ﬂuence.
g During the terrestrial A0 exposures, the specimens were exposed to a negligible amount of U V as compared to
E; the U V exposure of the test specimens in the space ﬂight experiment. The source of the U V was the plasma used to
3 dissociate the diatomic oxygen into monotomic A0 and was unavoidable.
§
3“ C. Leak rate of on-orbit specimens
E. The leak rates of the ram-facing, wake-facing, and control specimens of the three elastomer compounds were
g quantiﬁed. In general, the leak rate performance of the 80383-70 silicone elastomer compound was superior to the
a other two compounds investigated, as shown in Fig. 4. While all of the elastomers exhibited degradation in leak rate
E performance after on-orbit exposure, the XELA-SA-40l compound exhibited the the largest increase in leak rate
5 after ﬂight.
a l. S0383-70 elastomer compound
g The leak rates of the test specimens manufactured from 80383-70 silicone elastomer compound increased
% modestly after exposure to the space environment, as shown in Fig. 5. The average leak rate of the non-pretreated
Q control specimens, which were not exposed on-orbit, was 0.020><10'4 lbm/day. The ram- and wake-facing
:5 specimens, including those with and without surface pretreatment, performed similarly with leak rate averages of
<2: l.4><10'4 and l.2><10'4 lbm/day, respectively; however, the scatter in the data was more pronounced at the higher A0
4: ﬂuence.
ﬁg Of particular interest, specimens with A0 pretreatment exhibited lower leak rate after similar levels of on-orbit
E exposure than those specimens without pretreatment. The leak rates from the test specimens of 80383-70 material on
8 the wake-facing test plate were represented by the siX on-orbit data points, in two groups of three, on the left side of
Fig. 5. Of the siX data points, the left most group of three represents the specimens that were not pretreated with A0
prior to ﬂight. The average leak rate of these specimens without pretreatment was 2.2 times greater than those with
A0 pretreatment. When similar comparisons are made for the siX ram-facing specimens on the right of Fig. 5, three
haVing received A0 pretreatment, the average leak rate was 3.0 times greater for those specimens without A0
pretreatment than those with pretreatment.

Both the ram-facing and wake-facing exposure assemblies had a 80383-70 O-ring installed under a stainless
steel cap and the polyimide sample, see Fig. 1. This specimen was not exposed to A0 or U V; it was exposed only to
the vacuum pressure and thermal conditions of space ﬂight. The post-ﬂight measured leak rates were 0.0045><10'4
and 0.00038><10'4 lbm/day for the ram-facing and wake-facing specimens, respectively. These leak rates were less
than the leak rates measured for untreated test specimens from the control plate which ranged from 0.0082><10'4 to
0.0260><10'4 lbm/day.

j After exposure to approximately 18 months of on-orbit space environment, the leak rates of the 80899-50 test
£2 specimens were found to have increased relative to the control test specimens, as shown in Fig. 6. The average leak
E rate of the rani-facing test specimens was 7.1><10'4 lbm/day, a 166% increase above the average leak rate of the
(“j wake-facing test specimens (2.7><10'4 lbm/day). For comparison, the non-pretreated control test specimens leaked an
(:3 average of 0.019><10'4 lbm/day.
E5 Similar to observations of the 80383-70 compound, the A0 pretreated 80899-50 specimens had a lower leak rate
E than those without pretreatment. Five specimens were exposed to the on-orbit environment in a wake facing
% orientation, including two that were A0 pretreated. The average leak rate of those specimens without pretreatment
9 were 2.1 times greater than those specimens with pretreatment, as shown on the left portion of Fig. 6 (Four
(:2: specimens are Visible; one is hidden behind the others). Similarly, analysis of the rani-facing specimens showed that
i the three 80899-50 specimens without pretreatment exhibited a 1.4 times greater leak rate than the two specimens
g with pretreatment, indicating that the A0 pretreatment process may have a beneﬁcial effect on leak rate
g performance.
a
g 3. XELA-SA-401
The ram- and wake-facing test specimens manufactured from XELA-SA-401 silicone elastomer compound were
found to signiﬁcantly degrade after on-orbit space environments exposure, as shown in Fig. 7. While the average
leak rate of the control specimen, 0.01 OX 10'4 lbm/day, was similar to the other two elastomers, the average leak rates
of the ram- and wake-facing were signiﬁcantly higher, 32><10'4 and 54><10'4 lbm/day, respectively.
Due to the poor leak rate performance relative to the other elastomer compounds, the XELA-SA-401 compound
was eliminated at this point in the study; specimens were not exposed to terrestrial A0 nor investigated further.
D. Leak rate of terrestrially exposed specimens
The terrestrially exposed test specimens were from the same batch and lot of material as the ﬂight specimens.
The specimens exposed to A0 were exposed to A0 ﬂuences comparable to those reported for the rani-facing and
wake-facing test specimens, as shown in Table 4.

; leak rate of the test specimens, two of the ﬂight specimen
5 materials, 80383-70 and 80899-50, were compared to terrestrial specimens that received various ﬂuence levels of
i; A0.
3 1. S0383-70 elastomer compound
§ The leak rate performance of the on-orbit specimens was compared to the terrestrially exposed specimens with
3“ similar A0 ﬂuence, see Fig. 10. For the wake-facing specimens, the A0 ﬂuences were 6.0><1020 (non-pretreated) and
E. 2.3><1020 atonis/in.2 for the on-orbit and terrestrial exposures, respectively. The leak rate of the wake-facing on-orbit
g specimens was 74 times greater than those specimens terrestrially A0 exposed; albeit, the A0 level was 2.6 times
55 greater. Using a similar method of comparison for the ram-facing specimens, the average leak rate of the terrestrially
E A0 exposed specimens (2.4><10'4 lbm/day) was 3.4 and 1.1 times greater than the average leak rates of the A0
a pretreated and non-pretreated ram-facing on-orbit specimens (0.71 ><10""4 lbm/day and 2.1><10'4 lbm/day,
:5 respectively).
% 2. S0899-50 elastomer compound
a The average leak rate of the wake-facing on-orbit specimens was 250 times greater than the terrestrially exposed
Q specimens for similar A0 ﬂuences (2.3><1020 and 6.0><1020 atonis/in.2 (non-pretreated), respectively), see Fig. 11.
:5 The ram-facing on-orbit environment had a far greater degrading effect on the leak rate performance. The average
<2: leak rate was 5.7><10'4 and 8.0><10'4 lbm/day for the A0 pretreated and non-pretreated ram-facing specimens,
4: respectively, exposed to 1.2><1022 atoms/in.2. The average leak rate of the terrestrially exposed (1.1><1022 atoms/in.2)
§ specimens was 1.7><10'4 lbm/day. The average leak rates of the terrestrially A0 exposed specimens were 0.30 and
g 0.21 times that of the ram-facing specimens, with and without A0 pretreatment, respectively. This would indicate
8 that other environmental factors (e.g., long-term vacuum pressure, temperature ﬂuctuations, and ultraviolet and
particle radiation) affect the leak rate performance of the 80899-50.
F. Relative leak rate comparison of the compounds
A relative comparison between the compounds was completed to determine which, if any, of the three silicone
compounds would be best suited for further investigation for application to externally exposed spaceﬂight.
As stated previously, the XELA-SA-401 compound performed poorly relative to the others, as shown in Fig. 4.
This was not unexpected as the material was a natural rubber color and appeared to be free of pigments that may
otherwise act as a U V inhibitor. As a result, the color of the samples returned after ﬂight was visibly darker.
Comparing the ram-facing 80383-70 and 80899-50 specimens, haVing been exposed to atomic oxygen ﬂuence of
1.2><1022 atonis/in.2 and 2620 ESH of U V during ﬂight, revealed that the leak rate of the 80899-50 was 5 times that
of the 80383-70 specimens. The wake-facing specimens were exposed to 6.1><1020 atoms/in.2 and 1950 ESH. The
ratio of the two compounds’ leak rates after wake-facing ﬂight was 2:1 (80899-50180383-70).

E“ 6.1><1020 atonis/in.2 and 1950 ESH for wake-facing ﬂight. The average leak rates for the ram-facing and wake-
E facing ﬂight 80393-70 specimens were 1.4><10'4 and 1.2><10'4 lbm/day respectively.
