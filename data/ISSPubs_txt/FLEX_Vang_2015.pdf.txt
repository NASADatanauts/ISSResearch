Data Analysis
The processing of image sequences is automated using a
code (Aharon et al. 2013) written in the MATLAB computer
language. Properties such as droplet diameter and droplet
centroid location are evaluated for a region of interest (ROI).
As Opposed to using edge detection techniques, converting
each ROI directly into a binary image based on a global
intensity threshold T was sufficient in most cases to sepa—
rate the droplet from the background. Calculation of T is
achieved using Otsu’s method (Otsu 1979). To generate a
binary image from the ROI, all pixels having an intensity _ _
