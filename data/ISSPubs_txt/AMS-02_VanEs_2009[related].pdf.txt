ABSTRACT
The AMS Tracker Thermal Control System (TTCS) is a tWO-phase cooling system developed by NLR (The Netherlands), INFN
Perugia (Italy), Sun Yat Sen University, Zhuhai (China), AIDC Taichung, Taiwan, Massachusetts Institute 0fTechn010gy(USA), and
NIKHEF (The Netherlands). The TTCS is part of the Alpha Magnetic Spectrometer (AMSOZ) experiment to be located 011 the
International Space Station (188) truss. The TTCS is a mechanically pumped tWO-phase carbon dioxide cooling 100p. Main objective
is to provide accurate (< 3 K) temperature control and remove 140 W heat of the AMSOZ Tracker front-end electronics. The TTCS
requirements, system design, development status and some typical test results are described. Final integration of the TTCS is
scheduled October 2009. An outlook is given to potential spin-off. In particular to What extend the system can be used as cooling
system for high-power communication satellites, future scientiﬁc spacecraft requiring tight temperature control and AMS-like
terrestrial particle detectors used at CERN.
INTRODUCTION

anti-helium nuclei primarily), for dark matter and 10st matter.
The Alpha Magnetic Spectrometer (AMS) is a space born A ﬁrst version of the detector, known as AMS-Ol, ﬂew aboard

years, collecting several billions of high-energy protons and the project and gave important suggestions for further

"10","In ﬁgure 18 a typical test result is shown for varying
dissipating load on the evaporator, simulating switching on/off
the Tracker segments. Even With power changes far above the
Tracker electronics dissipation levels n0 instabilities were
detected.

A more challenging test with similar results is shown in ﬁgure

19 Where a large heat imbalance between the upper and lower

evaporator branch is simulated. The evaporator temperature
stability is however not affected. A11 Engineering Model and
Qualiﬁcation Model tests showed reliable performance in all
operating conditions.
The final TTCS test will be the ﬂight model testing With
connected ﬂight Tracker radiators during AMSOZ thermal
vacuum testing in ESA’s Large Space Simulator.

SPIN-OFF AND FUTURE DEVELOPMENTS
Sp_in-0ff
The selling points of mechanically pumped tWO-phase systems
are:

° The possibility to locate the temperature control at a
distant location (up to 100 meters) far away from the to be
cooled item or instrument.

° The possibility to provide thermal control for distributed
dissipative elements

° High temperature stability and isothermal behaviour

° Reliable straightforward operation and start-up

Special for C02 is the low 1iquid/vap0ur density ratio resulting
in low evaporator pressure drops providing the possibility to
implement tight thermal control in extremely conﬁned areas.
These selling points resulted in the implementation of a
TTCS-like system in the Vertex Locator (Velo) instrument of
the Large Hadron Collider (LHCb) by NIKHEF [9]. This 2.5
kW system is successfully implemented and tests showed
more than satisfactory results. Currently the two other large
CERN experiments ATLAS and CMS are considering a
similar system for the upgrade of their inner detectors. This
requires upscaling With a factor 1000 compared to the TTCS.

Sp_ace ap_p_1icati0ns

The current commercial Spacecraft (S/C) are running to their
thermal limits meaning that the radiator area is too small to
provide enough cooling capacity. Recent requests of
customers Will force the industry to provide deployable
radiators. Firstly this Will be done With capillary pumped
cooling systems but for S/C requiring stable temperatures or
for future very dissipative telecommunication payloads
(Q>9kW), tWO-phase mechanically pumped systems are
advantageous and a competitive alternative to complex LHP-
HP networks. The ﬁrst application of a 2-phase mechanically
pumped loop is foreseen to cool an active antenna, requiring
tight and stable temperature control. This is expected not
earlier than 2015.
