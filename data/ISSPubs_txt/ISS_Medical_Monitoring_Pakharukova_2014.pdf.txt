Abstract—The aim of the present study was to examine the changes in the proteome proﬁle of the blood
serum in seven Russian cosmonauts after long—term space missions aboard International Space Station.
Blood was sampled 45—60 days prior to and 1 and 7 days after the end of the mission. One day after the end
of ymission, we found a decrease in the peaks of BZ—microglobulin and apolipoprotein CI. Additionally, we
revealed shifts in functioning of the proteolytic systems of the blood, which were reﬂected in the changes in
peak areas for speciﬁc proteins, such as ﬁbrinogen, complement C3, high—rnolecular—weight kininogen,
inhibitor of inter—oc—trypsin, and clusterin.
