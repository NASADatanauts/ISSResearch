The ability to design and assemble three—dimensional structures from colloidal particles is limited by the absence of
specific directional bonds. As a result, complex or low—coordination structures, common in atomic and molecular
systems, are rare in the colloidal domain. Here we demonstrate a general method for creating the colloidal analogues
of atoms with valence: colloidal particles with chemically distinct surface patches that imitate hybridized atomic
orbitals, including sp, sp2, sp3, sp3d, sp3d2 and sp3d3. Functionalized with DNA with single—stranded sticky ends,
patches on different particles can form highly directional bonds through programmable, specific and reversible DNA
hybridization. These features allow the particles to self—assemble into ‘colloidal molecules’ with triangular, tetrahedral
and other bonding symmetries, and should also give access to a rich variety of new microstructured colloidal materials.
The past decade has seen an explosion in the kinds of colloidal part- either monovalent s or p orbitals, or multivalent 5p, spz, SP3, 5p3d,

self-assembly of these particles is largely controlled by their geometry, linear, triangular, tetrahedral, trigonal dipyramidal, octahedral or
