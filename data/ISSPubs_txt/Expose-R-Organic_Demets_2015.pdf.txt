Abstract: Expose is a multi-user instrument for astrobiological and astrocheniical experiments in space.
Installed at the outer surface of the International Space Station, it enables investigators to study the impact of
the open space environment on biological and biochemical test samples. Two Expose missions have been
completed so far, designated as Expose-E (Rabbow et a1. 2012) and Expose-R (Rabbow et al. this issue). One
of the space-unique environmental factors offered by Expose is full-spectrum, ultraviolet (UV)—rich
electromagnetic radiation from the Sun. This paper describes and analyses how on Expose-R, access of the
test samples to Solar radiation degraded during space exposure in an unpredicted way. Several windows in
front of the Sun-exposed test samples acquired a brown shade, resulting in a reduced transparency in Visible
light, UV and vacuum UV (VUV). Post-ﬁight investigations revealed the discolouration to be caused by a
homogenous ﬁlm of cross-linked organic polymers at the inside of the windows. The chemical signature
varied per sample carrier. No such ﬁlms were found on windows from sealed, pressurized compartments, or
on windows that had been kept out of the Sun. This suggests that volatile compounds originating from the
interior of the Expose facility were cross-linked and photo—ﬁxed by Solar irradiation at the rear side of the
windows. The origin of the volatiles was not fully identiﬁed; most probably there was a variety of sources
involved including the biological test samples, adhesives, plastics and printed circuit boards. The outer
surface of the windows (pointing into space) was chemically impacted as well, with a probable effect on the
transparency in VUV. The reported analysis of the window contamination on Expose-R is expected to help
the interpretation of the scientiﬁc results and offers possibilities to mitigate this problem on future missions —
in particular Expose-R2, the direct successor of Expose-R.
