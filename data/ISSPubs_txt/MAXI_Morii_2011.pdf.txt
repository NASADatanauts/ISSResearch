Abstract.
We report on the MAXI GSC X—ray monitoring of the Crab nebula and pulsar during the
GeV gamma—ray ﬂare on 2010 September detected by AGILE and Fermi—LAT. There were
no signiﬁcant variations on the pulse—phase—averaged and pulsed ﬂuxes during the gamma—ray
ﬂare. The pulse proﬁle also showed no signiﬁcant Change during the period. The upper limits
on the variation of the pulse—phase—averaged and pulsed ﬂuxes 0n MJD 55457.5—55462.5 in
the 4—10 keV band are 1% and 19% at the 90% conﬁdence limit of the statistical uncertainty,
respectively. Here, the measured ﬂuxes include a 2% systematic uncertainty at the 1—0 limit
due to the error on the instrument calibration. The lack of variations in the pulsed component
in multi—wavelength range (radio, soft X—ray, hard X—ray, and gamma—ray) supports the nebula
origin for the gamma—ray ﬂare.
1. Introduction
The Crab nebula is a remnant of the supernova on 1054. There is a neutron star (pulsar) With a
spin period Of 33 ms at the center of the nebula. The Crab nebula has been the standard candle
of X—ray and gamma—ray astronomy, because the ﬂux and spectrum have been expected to be
steady for a long time scale of years. Surprisingly, AGILE and Fermi—LAT reported a gamma—
ray ﬂare on 2010 September 18—23 in more than 100 MeV energy range [1, 2]. RXTE—ASM,
Swift—BAT, INTEGRAL did not detect variation for the pulse—phase—averaged ﬂux [3]. Radio
Observation showed no evidence for a glitch, and no Changes of pulsed ﬂux and pulse proﬁle
shape [4]. Swift—XRT and RXTE—PCA follow—up Observations did not detect any Changes of
ﬂux, spectrum and pulse proﬁle [5, 6]. Chandra and HST follow—up Observations found some
activated region around the nebula [7]. Recently, two more GeV ﬂare episodes, happened on
October 2007 and February 2009, were reported by AGILE and Fermi, respectively [2, 7]. Swift,
Super—AGILE and Fermi have not seen signiﬁcant variations in the pulsed emission in hard
X—ray t0 gamma—ray during the three ﬂaring periods.

2. Observation
MAXI (Monitor 0f All—sky X—ray Image) is an all—sky X—ray monitor, mounted on the J apanese
Experiment Module — Exposed Facility (J EM—EF 0r Kibo—EF) 0n the International Space Station
(188) [8]. It carries two types of X—ray cameras: the Gas Slit Camera (GSC; [9, 10]) for 2—30 keV
band and SOlid—state Slit Camera (SSC; [11, 12]) for 0.5—12 keV band, using gas proportional
counters and X—ray CCDs, respectively. GSC scans almost all sky every 92 minutes with the
ﬁeld of View (FOV) with width of 1.5 degree (FWHM). MAXI GSC scans almost all sky every
92 mins by a transit duration about 1 min. The time resolution of GSC is 50 ,us. The absolute
time assignment is conﬁrmed to be accurate within the stability of the time (10 : 0.2 ms) [10].
MAXI has been monitoring the Crab nebula since the start of the operation on August 15, 2009
(UT), including the whole duration of the gamma—ray ﬂare on September 2010. Here, we report
on the MAXI monitoring of the Crab nebula during the GeV gamma—ray ﬂare. The details will
be shown in Morii et al. (2011)[13] in the near future.
3. Light curve and pulse proﬁle
To measure the pulse—phase—averaged ﬂux, we extracted the Circular region on the sky coordinate
and subtracted the background counts from the near—by region as done in the usual photometry
method. Figure 1 (top) shows the light curves of the pulse—phase—averaged ﬂux in 4—10 keV
band. On the other hand, to measure the pulsed ﬂux, we proceeded the following steps. At ﬁrst,
the times of events were corrected to the solar system baryeenter. The time sequence was folded
in the pulse period Of Crab pulsar provided at the web site of the J 0drell Bank radio Observatory
[14]. In this folding, the time variation of effective area and exposure times were corrected [15,
16]. We ﬁtted the pulse proﬁles with a model of a x T + b, where T was a template pulse proﬁle
made from the data from December 13, 2009 to January 11, 2010, and the baseline offset of
un—pulsed component was subtracted from the all phase bins. From this ﬁt, we obtained the
pulsed ﬂux by Fpulse : a Z,- Ti/N. Figure 1 (bottom) shows the light curve of pulsed ﬂuxes in
4—10 keV band. There is no signiﬁcant ﬂux change on the gamma—ray ﬂare period. The 90%
conﬁdence level upper limits on the variation of the pulse—phase—averaged and pulsed ﬂuxes 0n
the ﬂare period (MJD 55457.5—554625) were 1% and 19% in the 4—10 keV band. The pulse
proﬁle during the ﬂare period is shown in Figure 2. T here is no signiﬁcant Change from the
template pulse proﬁle.
4. Summary
We report on the MAXI GSC Observation of the Crab pulsar during the gamma—ray ﬂare. It
is the only report showing the pulse proﬁle and pulsed ﬂux of the Crab pulsar 0n the whole
duration of the gamma—ray ﬂare in the X—ray band. The lack of the Changes on the pulsed
component in the gamma—ray energy range (> 100 MeV) suggests the nebula origin for the
gamma—ray ﬂare. The same result obtained in our MAXI Observation as well as that obtained
in radio and hard X—ray energy ranges support this scenario.
