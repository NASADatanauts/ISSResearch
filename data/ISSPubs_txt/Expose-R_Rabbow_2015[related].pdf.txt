Abstract: EXPOSE-R ﬂew as the second of the European Space Agency (ESA) EXPOSE multi-user
facilities on the International Space Station. During the mission on the external URM-D platform of
the Zvezda service module, samples of eight international astrobiology experiments selected by BSA and one
Russian guest experiment were exposed to low Earth orbit space parameters from March 10th, 2009 to
J anuary 21st, 2011. EXPOSE-R accommodated a total of 1220 samples for exposure to selected space
conditions and combinations, including space vacuum, temperature cycles through 273 K, cosmic radiation,
solar electromagnetic radiation at >110, > 170 or >200 nm at various ﬂuences up to G] m‘ 2. Samples ranged
from chemical compounds Via unicellular organisms and multicellular mosquito larvae and seeds to passive
radiation dosimeters. Additionally, one active radiation measurement instrument was accommodated on
EXPOSE-R and commanded from ground in accordance with the facility itself. Data on ultraviolet
radiation, cosmic radiation and temperature were measured every 10 s and downlinked by telemetry and
data carrier every few months. The EXPOSE-R trays and samples returned to Earth on March 9th, 2011
with Shuttle ﬂight, Space Transportation System (STS)—133/ULF 5, Discovery, after successful total mission
duration of 27 months in space. The samples were analysed in the individual investigators laboratories.
A parallel Mission Ground Reference experiment was performed on ground with a parallel set of
hardware and samples under simulated space conditions following to the data transmitted from the
ﬂight mission.
