ABSTRACT
The detrimental effects of spaceﬂight and simulated microgravity on the immune system have been extensively documented. We report here
mieroarray gene expression analysis, in concert with quantitative RT—PCR, in young adult C57BL/6NTaC mice at 8 weeks of age after exposure
to spaceﬂight aboard the space shuttle (STS—118) for a period of 13 days. Upon conclusion of the mission, thymus lobes were extracted from
space ﬂown mice (FLT) as well as age— and seX—matched ground control mice similarly housed in animal enclosure modules (ABM). mRNA was
extracted and an automated array analysis for gene expression was performed. Examination of the microarray data revealed 970 individual
probes that had a 1.5—fold or greater Change. When these data were averaged (n = 4), we identiﬁed 12 genes that were signiﬁcantly up— or
down—regulated by at least 1.5—fold after spaceﬂight (P g 0.05). The genes that signiﬁcantly differed from the AEM controls and that were also
conﬁrmed Via QRT—PCR were as follows: Rbm3 (up—regulated) and Hsph110, Hsp90aa1, Cxcll 0, Stip], Fkbp4 (down—regulated). QRT—PCR
eonf1rn1edthe microarray results and demonstrated additional gene expression alteration in other T cell related genes, including: C tla—4, IFN—
ozZa (up—regulated) and CD44 (down—regulated). Together, these data demonstrate that spaceﬂight induces signiﬁcant Changes in the thymic
mRNA expression of genes that regulate stress, glucocorticoid receptor metabolism, and T cell signaling activity. These data explain,
in part, the reported systemic compromise of the immune system after exposure to the microgravity of space. J . Cell. Biochem. 110: 372—38 1,
