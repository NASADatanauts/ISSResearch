Speciﬁc coating processes and materials were investigated in the quest to develop multilayer coatings
with greater tolerance to space radiation exposure. Ultraviolet reﬂection (UVR) and wide-band antire-
ﬂection (AR) multilayer coatings were deposited on solar cell covers and test substrates and subsequently
exposed to simulated space environments and also ﬂown on the Materials International Space Station
Experiment-7 (MISSE-7) to determine their space environment stability. Functional solar cells inte-
grated with these coatings underwent simulated UV and MISSE-7 low earth orbit ﬂight exposure.
The effects of UV, proton, and atomic oxygen exposure on coatings and on assembled solar cells as related
to the implemented deposition processes and material compositions were small. The UVR/AR coatings
protected ﬂexible polymer substrate materials that are intended for future ﬂexible multijunction cell
arrays to be deployed from rolls. Progress was made toward developing stable and protective coatings
for extended space-mission applications. Test results are presented. © 2014 Optical Society of America
