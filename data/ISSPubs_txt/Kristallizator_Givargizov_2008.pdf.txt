Abstract
The growth of biocrystalline ﬁlms of catalase on amorphous substrates having a crystallographically symmetric mierorelief (artiﬁcial
epitaxy, or “graphoepitaxy”) was studied both under microgravity conditions in space and on the Earth. While highly oriented ﬁlms
formed under microgravity conditions, the ﬁlms grown in comparable earth experiments were more disordered, with fewer crystallites
oriented parallel to the steps of the microrelief. This difference can be explained by the fact that, in microgravity, only the surface forces
between the biocrystallites and the substrates are active. On the Earth, other gravity-induced effects such as sedimentation and ﬂuid
convection also play an important role in crystallite orientation.
