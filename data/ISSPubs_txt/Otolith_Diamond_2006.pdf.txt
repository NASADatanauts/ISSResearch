Abstract

Conclusion. Most of the subjects studied had eye torsion responses to pitch, although the direction of torsion varied between

subjects. Opposite responses may be the result of individual variation in anatomical or physiological vector orientations of

hair cells in the anterior or posterior utricle or in the saccule. Objective. This study aimed to determine whether systematic

changes in eye torsion occur when subjects are rotated in forward and backward pitch. Materials and methods. Twenty-one

normal subjects were seated in a dual axis human rotator, positioned so that the interaural axis was aligned with the axis of

pitch rotation. Fixation LED suppressed vertical or horizontal eye movement. Recordings were carried out in darkness apart

from the ﬁxation LED, using a three-dimensional eye tracker based on CMOS image sensors. Subjects were twice tilted

from upright to 900 occiput down, then forward to 450 face down. Results. Most subjects had eye torsion changes in

response to pitch, with mean amplitudes of approximately 20 to 900 backward tilt and 10 to 450 forward tilt. Ten subjects had

clockwise torsion to backward pitch and counterclockwise to forward pitch; six subjects had the opposite responses.

Statistical testing of the distributions of the regression slopes between these two groups were signiﬁcant (p <0.001). Five

subjects had unclear responses.
