Abstract
We report on X—ray Spectral and timing results of the new black hole candidate
(BHC) MAXI J1659—152 With the orbital period Of 2.41 hours (Shortest among BHCS)
1

"
"2","in the 2010 outburst from 65 Rossi X—ray Timing Explorer (RXTE) Observations and
8 simultaneous Swift and RXTE Observations. According to the deﬁnitions of the
spectral states in Remillard 85 McClintOCk (2006), most of the Observations have
been Classiﬁed into the intermediate state. All the X—ray broadband spectra can
be modeled by a multi—Color disk plus a power—law With an exponential cutoff or a
multi—Color disk plus a Comptonization component. During the initial phase of the
outburst, a high energy cutoff was Visible at 30—40 keV. The innermost radius of the
disk gradually decreased by a factor of more than 3 from the onset of the outburst and
reached a constant value of 35 al10(:0sz'_1/2 km, Where die is the distance in units of 10
kpc and 2' is the inclination. The type—C quasi—periodic oscillation (QPO) frequency
varied from 1.6 HZ to 7.3 HZ in association With a Change Of the innermost radius,
While the innermost radius remained constant during the type—B QPO detections at
1.6—4.1 HZ. Hence, we suggest that the origin of the type—B QPOs is different from
that Of type—C QPOs, the latter of WhiCh would originate from the disk truncation
radius. Assuming the constant innermost radius in the latter phase of the outburst
as the innermost stable Circular orbit, the black hole mass in MAXI J1659—152 is
estimated to be 3.6—8.0 M9 for a distance of 5.3—8.6 kpc and an inclination angle of
60—75 degrees.
Key words: accretion, accretion disks — black hole physics — stars: individual
(MAXI J1659—152) — X—rays: stars
1. Introduction
Black hole candidates (BHCs) are very important Objects for the understanding of aC—
Cretion and jets in high energy astrophysics (see Remillard 85 McClintOCk 2006, McClintOCk 85
Remillard 2006, and Belloni 2010 for a review). Most Of them are Close X—ray binaries consisting
of a black hole and a low mass companion (Cyg X—l, LMC X—l and X—3 are persistent high
mass exceptions) Characterized by outbursts separated by quiescent periods. During a typical
outburst, they go through the hard state (or IOW/hard state), steep power—law state (SPL; or
very high state), intermediate state (IMS), and thermal state (or high/soft state), then the
hard state and back to the quiescence, although some other state Classiﬁcations are present
(e.g. soft—intermediate and hard—intermediate state in Belloni 2010).
In the hard state, the X—ray spectrum can be approximately explained by a power—law
With an exponential cutoff at 100—200 keV. The power spectrum is Characterized by strong
variability (20—30 %) With band—limited noise. The hard X—ray emission likely originates from
thermal Comptonization in a high temperature corona (~109 K) of soft photons from the disk.
On the other hand, the thermal state spectrum is dominated by a soft component Which is
considered to be a blackbody from the geometrically thin, Optically thick accretion disk (~107
2

"
"3","K). This X—ray spectrum is well ﬁt by the Inulti—Color disk (MCD) model (Mitsuda et al. 1984,
Makishiina et al. 1986), and also by more accurate accretion disk models (e.g. Li et al. 2005,
Davis et al. 2005) which have been developed to take into account relativistic effects. The
derived innermost radius from the MOD model typically remains constant at a value which
might correspond to the innermost stable Circular orbit (ISCO), from which an estimate of the
BH mass can be found. Thus derived, black hole mass from X—ray data is found to be consistent
with the BH Inass estimated from the binary kinematics (Ebisawa et al. 1993, Dotani et al.
1997)

Compared to the two main states, both the SPL and IMS are not well understood.
They frequently appear during state transitions between the hard and thermal states. Both
disk and power—law components are Clearly present in the energy spectra, and the power spectra
show strong time variability associated with low—frequeney QPOs (LFQPOs), seen at 01—10 HZ
(Reinillard & McClintOCk 2006). Several types of LFQPOs have been identiﬁed and Classiﬁed
into type A, B and C by Reinillard et al. (2002) and Casella et al. (2005). Type A and B QPOs
are Characterized by a relatively low coherence (the coherence parameter Q :3 for type A and
Q :6 for type B) and a narrow frequency range of 1—8 HZ associated with a weak red—neise
component. Features for the type—C QPOs include a high coherence parameter (Q 310), a
variable frequency (01—10 Hz), and strong broadband noise under the QPO. The study Of
LFQPOs is essential to our understanding of the spectral state transitions in BHCs, but their
origin is still a topic of debate.

A new hard X—ray transient was ﬁrst discovered as Gamma Ray Burst (GRB) 100925A
on September 25, 2010 (MJD 55464) by the Swift Burst Alert Telescope (BAT; Bartheliny et
al. 2005) (Mangaro et al. 2010). The Gas Slit Camera (GSC; Mihara et al. 2011) on board the
Monitor 0f All—sky X—ray Image (MAXI; Matsuoka et al. 2009) independently detected this X—
ray transient and localized it to (RA, Dee):(16h59m10s, —15016’05”) with a 0.2 degree accuracy
(Negoro et al. 2010). The source was designated as MAXI J1659—152. The MAXl/GSC data
showed that, unlike normal GRBs, the X—ray ﬂux rapidly increased following the discovery.
Rossi X—ray Timing Explorer (RXTE; Bradt, Rothschild, & Swank 1993) follew—up Observations
revealed the source as a BHC from spectral and timing properties (Kalamkar et al. 2010). Due
to the Swift BAT prompt GRB trigger and the source’s location well above the Galactic plane,
Inany Inulti—wavelength Observations including radio (van der Horst et al. 2010), subinIn bands
(den Ugarte Pestigo et al. 2010), near—infrared (D’Avanze et al. 2011), optical (Russel et al.
2010), X—rays and GeV gainina—rays (Luearelli et al. 2010) have been carried out since the
discovery. The XMM—Newton, RXTE, and Swift data revealed the presence of X—ray dips in
their light curves with a period Of 2.41 hours (Kuulkers et al. 2010, 2011, Belloni, Munoz—
Darias, & Kuulkers 2010, Kennea et al. 2011). The amplitude modulation with this period was
also conﬁrmed by the Optical data in the VSNET—teain report (Kuroda et al. 2010). These
results indicate that MAXI J1659—152 has the shortest orbital period among all the black hole

3

"
"4","candidates (the second shortest one is 3.2 hours for Swift J1753.5—0127 (Zurita et a1. 2008)).

Several X—ray results have already been reported in Kalamkar et a1. (2011), Muiios—Darias
et a1. (2011) and Shaposhnikov et a1. (2011), and Kennea et a1. (2011). We shortly summarize
results from these four groups who published spectral and timing results using the same RXTE
and Swift data sets. Kalamkar et a1. (2011) showed a BHC signature based on the hardness—
intensity diagram (Hoinan & BeIIoni 2005) and timing properties including the LFQPO Clas—
siﬁoation. At almost the same time, Muiios—Darias et a1. (2011) reported on detailed timing
properties, including time lags for QPOs. These two papers mainly focus on timing properties,
although they performed spectral ﬁtting with a simple model, i.e. wabs*(diskbb+powerlaw).
Shaposhnikov et a1. (2011) performed spectral ﬁts with the bqu—Inotion Comptonization model
(bmc in XSPEC; Titarohuk, Mastiohiadis &Kylaﬁs 1997), and estimated a BH mass of 20i3 MG
and a distance of 7.6i1.1 kpo using the speetraI—tiining correlation sealing technique. Results
from Swift/UVOT, XRT and BAT data covering MJD 55464 (Day 0) to 55491 (Day 27) were
reported by Kennea et a1. (2011). They have detected X—ray dips and Type—C QPOs at 015—19
HZ, particularly during the initial phase of the outburst, and performed broadband ﬁts with
XRT and BAT data.

In this paper, we report on detailed spectral modeling and combined spectral and timing
results using 8 (quasi) simultaneous Swift/XRT and RXTE/PCA observations, as well as the
same RXTE data sets. In Sections 2 and 3, we describe the RXTE follow—up observations
and details of spectral and timing analysis of the data. We also show spectral results from
Swift/XRT and RXTE/PCA observations. In Section 4, we discuss how our results compare
with those from other BHCs, an estimation of the black hole mass of MAXI J1659—152 from
spectral results alone, and the physical origin of the low frequency QPOs. Finally, we will
conclude this paper with a summary.

2. Observations and Data Analysis
2.]. RXTE

Following the Swift and MAXI discovery of MAXI J 1659—152, we triggered RXTE Target
of Opportunity (ToO) observations approved in the A014 Open—Tiine program to reveal its
nature. Our follow—up observations started on September 28, 2010, and two other programs
were triggered after our observations and continued until November 8, 2010, when the source
was not observable due to the Sun constraint of the satellite. These series of observations
contain 65 pointed observations under the observation IDs 95358, 95108 and 95118. The net
deadtiine—oorreoted PCA exposure was 134.6 kseo, with an averaged exposure of about 2.1 kseo
per pointed observation.

The RXTE carries three scientiﬁc instruments: the Proportional Counter Array (PCA;
Jahoda et a1. 2006), the High Energy X—ray Timing Experiment (HEXTE; Rothschild et a1.

4

"
"5","1998), and the All—Sky Monitor (ASM; Levine et a1. 1996). The PCA consists of ﬁve identical
proportional counters (PCU 0—4) which are sensitive in the 2—100 keV range, while the HEXTE
is composed of two identical NaI(T1) /CsI(Na) phcswich scintillatcrs (we distinguish the detec—
tcrs as Cluster A and B) which are sensitive in the 15—250 keV range. All three instruments
are still active and working well in space since the launch in December 1995.

We analyzed the RXTE data using the standard FTOOLS, HEADAS version 6.9, pro—
vided by NASA Goddard Space Flight Center (GSFC). For the PCA spectral analysis, we
used the Standard 2 mode data, which has 16 sec time resolution and 129 energy channels.
The selection criteria were: (1) the Offset angle is larger than 0.02 degrees; (2) the elevation
from the Earth is larger than 10 degrees; (3) the PCU2 is active; and (4) there are no PCU
breakdowns. We accumulated the energy spectra from only the top layer of the PCU2. Dip
events seen in RXTE/PCA and Swift/XRT data were not excluded in our analysis. The PCA
background was estimated from the model for bright sources, which is publicly available at the
PCA analysis web sitel. We performed deadtirne corrections (the detector deadtirne is typically
2—3 %), and added a 0.5% systematic error to each energy bin. Based on the improvement to
the RXTE/PCA calibraticn2, the energy range was limited to 3—50 keV. XSPEC version 12.5
was used for spectral ﬁts. The errors are quoted at statistical 90% error. To check the validity
of the current response and our analysis method, we analyzed a Crab Observation (ObsID:
95802—01—18—00) with a net exposure of 658 sec, taken on October 22, 2010 during the MAXI
J1659—152 outburst. The ﬁt is acceptable (X2/dcf:62.0/77), and the Crab spectrum in the
3—50 keV range is explained by a power—law with a photon index of 2.12i0.01 and an Observed
ﬂux of 2.30><10_8 erg crn‘2 s‘1 in the 2—10 keV range, which is consistent with the nominal
values (chr & Seward 1974).

For the PCA timing analysis, we used the Event rncde data3, which has ﬁner tirne
resolutions than the standard rncde data. The power density spectra (PDS) were produced
using a light curve binned with a 7.8125 rnsec time resolution (Nyquist frequency: 64 HZ) and
powspec in the XRONOS package. The PDS were normalized to a unit of (rrns/rnean)2 HZ_1
after subtracting the Poisson noise.

Since J anuary 2010, the pointing directions of HEXTE Cluster A and B have been ﬁxed
toward the target position and the 1.5O—Offset background position. Hence, we needed to use
the background production tccl hextebackest, which predicts the background spectrum for
Cluster A from that Of Cluster B. However, the HEXTE data were not used because the current
version of hextebackest still leaves scrne systernatic features at ~60 keV in the background—
subtracted spectra.

"6","2.2. Swift/XRT

BHCs have a typical innerrnost disk blaok—body temperature of ~1 keV (i.e. an emission
peak of the blaokbody at ~28 keV) so we only see a Wien tail of the disk blaokbody spectrum in
the PCA energy range above 3 keV. Hence, there may be large uncertainties in disk pararneter
estimations of the MOD rnodel, especially when the disk temperature is lower than ~06 keV.
We, therefore, performed ﬁts of MAXI J1659—152 with Swift X—Ray Telescope (XRT; Burrows
et al. 2005) data, with soft band coverage over 03—10 keV, to obtain reliable disk parameters.
In the archived XRT data, we found 7 observations that were exactly sirnultaneous to RXTE
observations, and one (Period H) that was partially sirnultaneous. The list of simultaneous
observations and time intervals is shown in Table 1. All the XRT observations reported in this
paper were performed in the Windowed Timing (WT) mode. The XRT data were analyzed
in the public web interface4 (Evans et al. 2009), and the latest version of the XRT response
matrix, swxwt0to2s6_20070901v012.rrnf, was used. The energy range was limited to 06—9 keV
taking into account a calibration uncertainty at low energy and photon statistics at high energy.
3. Results
3.]. PCA Light Curve and State Classiﬁcation

The RXTE/PCA PCU2 light curves with a time resolution of 16 see in four energy
ranges (2—4, 4—10, 10—20, 2—20 keV) are shown in Figure 1. The data were normalized to the
PCU2 counts for the Crab nebula. The MAXl/GSC5, the RXTE/ASM6, the Swift/BAT7 data
were taken from the web sites for each instrument team, and also normalized to the Crab and
are shown for comparison. The ﬂux measurements between PCA and MAXI are consistent with
each other. The soft band ﬂux in the 2—10 keV range slowly rises with some variability, while
the hard band ﬂux rapidly rises within a few days and then slowly decreases. The approximate
e—folding time is about 30 days at high energies. On October 15, 2010, the peak was about 300
rnCrab in the 2—20 keV range, and the total outburst duration was about 65 days, assuming
the MAXl/GSC and Swift/BAT data cover the whole outburst.

We Classiﬁed all the observations into aooretion states following the deﬁnitions in
Rernillard & MoClintook (2006). Note that our Classiﬁcation is based on ﬁtting results with
the wabs* (diskbb+powerlaw) model in the 3—50 keV range, with a cutoff and iron line during
some of the early observations. We found that all the observations were Classiﬁed into just two
states: 58 lMSs and 7 hard states. Neither the thermal state nor the SPL state were observed.
The source was initially in the hard state for ~41 days, then transitioned into the IMS, where

3.2. Spectral ﬁtting results
3.2.]. RXTE/PCA
We ﬁrst ﬁt the PCA spectra with a disk blackbedy (0r MCD model; Mitsuda et al.
1984) plus a power—law modiﬁed with the Galactic absorption (i.e. wabs>|< (diskbb+powerlaw))
which are typical components in the X—ray spectra of BHCs. However, a reﬁeetien—like struc—
ture was found above 7 keV. In addition, a high energy cutoff was required at 30—40 keV
in some Observations during the initial phase of the outburst. Hence we used the model
wabs*(diskbb+smedge*cutoffp) (hereafter model A) throughout all the data. The hydro—
gen column density (NH) in wabs was ﬁxed at the Galactic value of 1.7><1021 errr2 (Kalberla
et al. 2005) following Kalamkar et al. (2011) since the PCA can not determine NH due to the
lack of low energy sensitivity. Using a slightly higher value of 3x 1021 ern—2 (see Section 3.2.2),
we found that the ﬁtting results did not Change signiﬁcantly. The energy and the width of
the smeared edge (Ebisawa et al. 1994) were ﬁxed at 7.11 keV and 10 keV due to the neutral
iren—K edge. The averaged X2 is 56.5 for 73 degrees of freedom (def) and the maximum X2
7

"
"8","is 86.5, suggesting that our spectral ﬁts are reasonable. We also tried two other spectral mod—
els, wabs* (diskbb+cutoffp+gaussian) and wabs* (diskbb+pexrav), using a narrow Gaussian
line at 6.4 keV or a reﬂection component instead of the smeared edge. However, we found that
model A gives better ﬁts than these two models (the average X2 is 63.3 and 57.9 for 72 def. fer
wabs*(diskbb+cutoffp+gaussian) and wabs*(diskbb+pexrav), respectively). To show the
time variation of spectral and timing parameters over the course of the outburst, we selected
8 Observations including 2 hard states and 6 lMSs as representatives. Figure 2 shows the VFV
spectra for them.

Tiine variation of the spectral parameters (innermost diskbb temperature Tin, innermost
radius 73118 (hereafter we assume D=10 kpe and i=00 for simplicity when quoting Tin), photon
index F, and e—folding energy Ef), the disk ﬁuX, the cutoff power—law (CPL) ﬂux, and the total
ﬂux in the 2—20 keV range are shown in Figure 3. Note that the Observed Tin and Tin are not
physical because of the spectral hardening due to the electron scattering in the innermost part
Of the accretion disk and also the lack of the innermost boundary condition in the MOD model
(see Section 4.2).

Tin increases from ~05 to a peak of ~08 keV (day 18), and then drops down to 0.5
keV in the decaying phase. During the initial and ﬁnal phases, where the source is mainly in
the hard state, the Tin shows some variations with large error bars. Although the ﬁts require
the disk component, the disk estimation might have large uncertainties due to a low sensitivity
below 3 keV 0f RXTE/PCA (see Section 3.2.2). In fact, we directly compare the Tin measured
by Swift/XRT published in Kennea et al. (2011), and found that the differences were signiﬁcant
during the hard state (0.5—0.6 keV for the PCA versus 0.3—0.4 keV for the XRT). Tin never
exceeds 1 keV, which has been Observed in bright BHCs (e.g. GRO J1655—40 (Sobezak et al.
1999), H 1743—322 (McClintOCk et al. 2009), and XTE J1550—564 (Sobezak et al. 2000)). In
spite of variations of Tin and the disk ﬁuX, the innermost radius Tin remains constant at ~30
km.

The F of the CPL component smoothly varies from 1.6 to 2.4 and then back to 1.6.
During a few Observations in the initial phase, a high energy cutoff at 30—40 keV is required
in the ﬁts. This is a bit low compared with typical values of 100—200 keV in the hard state
(Grove et al. 1998). Some BHCs show a lower cutoff during the initial bright hard state, which
is probably due to the rapid increase of the Compton cooling of a high temperature corona
by soft disk photons (Miyakawa et al. 2008). The hypothesis that the coronal temperature is
controlled by the disk ﬁuX will be discussed later (see Figure 8 and §4.1). The ﬂux of the hard
CPL component is independent of the disk—ﬁux variation as generally seen in many BHCs.

Steiner et al. (2009a) have pointed out that the hard power—law component diverges at
low energies in the wabs* (diskbb+powerlaw) model. This situation is unphysieal because the

power—law spectrum results from the Cemptenizatien of disk photons. Hence, they developed a
self—censistent Cemptenizatien model, simpl, in XSPEC. Because the power—law component of
MAXI .116597152 remained relatively strong throughout the outburst, we used this model as a
more accurate estimation for the disk parameters (i.e. wabs*smedge*highecut*simpl®diskbb,
where (X) means a convolutienihereafter model B). We used the up—scattering only Option in
simpl. The quality of the ﬁtting with this model was almost the same as in model A, yielding
an averaged X2 of 56.8 for 73 def. The time variation of the ﬁtting parameters is shown in
Figure 4. Model B ﬁts result in larger innermost radii, ”Fin, than those of model A because the
simpl Cemptenizatien model takes into account the contribution of the disk photons which are
scattered into the power—law component as well as direct disk emission. The innermost radius
is still roughly constant; there is an initial drop from ~50 kin to ~35 kin, where it remains for
most of the outburst.
3.2.2 Simultaneous Bmadband Fits between Swift/XRT and RXTE/PCA
We ﬁt the Swift/XRT and RXTE/PCA spectra simultaneously using models A and B
described in Section 3.2.1. To take into account the calibration uncertainties between the two
instruments, the PCA spectra were normalized to the XRT spectra, multiplying the PCA spctra

unity within a 20% accuracy. The hydrogen column density NH was left free.

best—ﬁt parameters are shown in Table 2. The NH measured in simultaneous ﬁts is almost
consistent With the Galactic value O.17><1022 (:In_2 for model B, and model A results in a
slightly higher value, by ~0.1><1022 em”, than this value. Their time evolution, shown by
red symbols in Figures 3 and 4, displays similar behavior to the results from the RXTE data
ﬁts. However, there are signiﬁcant differences between Observations With a lower disk ﬂux than
~1x10‘9 erg ern—2 s_l, mainly during the hard states; the ﬁts With RXTE data alone tend
to give signiﬁcantly higher Tin and smaller Tin than those obtained from the Swift—l—RXTE ﬁts.
Thanks to the joint broadband data, we deduce the reduction of Tin (by more than a factor of
three from N110 km to ~35 km) more precisely than that in the preceding section (from ~50
km to ~35 km). Hereafter, we do not discuss the disk parameters, Tin and Tim Obtained from

where DC is the QPO central frequency, AV is the FWHM width, and A is the QPO
amplitude integrated over the full frequency range. The coherence parameter Q is deﬁned by
VC/AV. We focus on the low frequency QPOs (LFQPOs) in these ﬁts because no signiﬁcant
high frequency QPOs were detected. We follow results from Muiies—Darias et a1. (2011) for the
Classiﬁcation of QPOs (Type A, B and C; Casella et a1. 2005) between 1 and 8 HZ in 51 0f 65

central frequency, widths, and the rms variability in the QPO parameters are consistent with

of the outburst, the frequency of the type—C QPOs gradually increased from 1.6 to 7.3 Hz and
then disappeared When the disk fraction was larger than 0.26. Later into the outburst, the
type—C QPOs appeared again at 5.9 HZ and decreased down to 1.6 Hz. Type—B QPOs were
seen at 1774.1 Hz in the limited time period When the disk fraction was a bit higher than in the
case Of type—C QPOs. The red noise component under the Type—B QPO is roughly explained
by v_O‘, Where oz ranges between 0.7711. This is consistent With v_l, as typically seen in the
thermal state (e.g. McClintOCk & Remillard 2006).

We can see a Clear correlation between the disk ﬂux and both Tin and F, While the Compton
fraction is independent of the disk ﬂux. The middle panel (a steeper photon index for a more
luminous disk) suggests that the coronal temperature is controlled by the disk ﬂux (see Section
4.1).
Figures 9 and 10 show the QPO frequency DC as a function of the disk ﬂux (220 keV),
Tin, Tin, Compton fraction, F, QPO amplitude A, and rms variability (integrated over 0.1710
HZ). There is a positive correlation between the type—C QPO VC and both the disk ﬂux and Tin.
We also conﬁrmed the VC—F correlation already suggested by Shaposhnikov et a1. (2011). The
correlation is negative With Compton fraction, QPO amplititude A, and fractional rms vari—
ability (including the noise component). The slopes of the VC-A and VC—rms correlations during
the type—C QPO detections are almost the same, i.e. A:—0.017i0.001VC(HZ)—|—0.171:|:0.005
and rms=—0.019i0.001v€(HZ)—l—0.248i0.002. The Tin obtained from model B shows an anti—
correlation with DC. This can be explained by ”rin(km) : 167T§SVC(HZ)_0'70i0'12 for combined
XRT and PCA data. All of the correlations obtained by PCA data alone can be conﬁrmed by
simultaneous Swift/XRT and RXTE/PCA observations. We also found that the correlation of
type—C VC does not depend on Which state the source was in. This implies that although we
have Classiﬁed the source into two separate states (IMS and hard state), the QPO may have
the same physical origin in the different states.
The type—B QPOs show different behavior than the type—C QPOs in the correlation plots.

4.]. Short Summary and Campam'son with Previous Results and Other Black Hole Binaries
We have presented detailed spectral and timing results from the 2010 outburst of a new
BHC, MAXI J16597152. We used the simpl Comptenizatien model for spectral modeling, and
mainly investigated a correlation between spectral parameters and the QPO parameters.
According to the Classiﬁcation criteria given by Remillard & McClinteck (2006), the
source made a state transition into the intermediate state from the hard state in the early

phase and went back to the hard state during the ﬁnal phase of the outburst. It stayed in
the intermediate state during almost Of all the Observations and never entered into the SPL
state or thermal state. This fact is already mentioned by Kalamkar et a1. (2011). The RXTE
Observations revealed that the time evolution of spectral and timing parameters in the 2010
outburst of MAXI J1659i152 are similar to other BHCs (e.g. McClintOCk & Remillard 2006).
The PCA spectra in the 3450 keV range and XRT—I—PCA broadband spectra in the 0.6450
keV range were successfully ﬁt by both the MOD (Mitsuda et a1. 1984) plus a power—law
with an exponential cutoff and the MOD convolved with simpl Comptenizatien (Steiner et al.
2009a). The maximum Tin in the accretion disk was ~09 keV, which is a bit lower than the
typical ~1.2 keV seen in bright BHCs such as GRO .11655740 (Sebczak et a1. 1999) and XTE
J15504564 (Sebczak et a1. 2000). Since Tin is proportional to 5—1/2771/4M_1/4 (Makishinia et
a1. 2000), the Eddington ratio (77:1) / LE) is relatively low if the BH mass M and spin (related
to 5=Rin/3RS; see Section 4.2) are similar to these bright sources. During the intermediate
states, the innermost radius remained almost constant at ~30 km (35 km in simpl ﬁts) in
spite of large variations in the disk ﬂux. The ﬂux variation of the hard CPL component was
independent of the disk ﬂux. The photon index in the hard component ranged from 1.6 to 2.4,
in correlation with the disk ﬂux, and did not reach typical SPL values of 2543.0 (McClinteck
& Remillard 2006).
In the initial phase, a high energy cutoff in the power—law component was Visible at 30*
40 keV. The cutoff energy then evolved into higher energies than the PCA maximum energy
(50 keV). The Observed e—felding energy is much lower than a typical value in the hard state
(100200 keV; Grove et a1. 1998), but a low cutoff energy has been seen for several BHCs during
18

"
"19","the rising phase (Miyakawa et a1. 2008), probably due to Compton cooling in the corona by
soft photons. This could also indicate a transition of the electron distribution from thermal
t0 n0n—therrna1 electrons in the corona, but we cannot investigate this issue due to the limited
PCA energy range up to 50 keV.

We conﬁrmed results from Kalamkar et a1. (2011) and Muiios—Darias et a1. (2011) that
LFQPOs, consisting of type—B and type—C, were Observed at 1—8 HZ in 51 0f 65 Observations.
The LFQPOs were seen when both disk and corona components were ﬁrmly present, and the
disk fraction was less than 35 % (i.e. the hard CPL component was strong). From detailed ﬁts
with the simpl Comptonization model, we have shown that the type—C QPO central frequency
varies from 1.6 HZ to 7.3 HZ in association with the disk ﬂux, the innermost temperature, the
innermost radius, the photon index, and the rrns variability, similar to that seen in several
BHCs (e.g. Shaposhnikov 85 Titarehuk 2009, Vignarea et a1. 2003).

Various types of QPOs including low—frequeney and high—frequeney QPOs have been
studied in many X—ray binaries frorn cataclysmic variables to black holes (Psaltis, Belloni, 85
van der Klis 1999, Belloni, Psaltis, 85 van der Klis 2002, Warner, Woudt, 85 Pretorius 2003),
but their origin is still unknown. Several models such as the Lense—Thirring precession model
(Stella 85 Vietri 1998) and the disk oscillation model (Kate 2001) have been proposed. For
type—C LFQPOs, we propose a possible scenario based upon the idea of a truncated accretion
disk. We assume that the high temperature, corona—like, advection dominated accretion ﬂow
(ADAF) is well inside the truncated disk (Esin, McClintOCk, 85 Narayan 1997). When the local
rnass accretion rate from the outer part Of the disk increases, the innermost temperature (Tin)
and the disk ﬂux (oc Té) also increase (see left panel of Figure 8). As the disk ﬂux increases, the
corona undergoes cooling due to the Compton scattering of soft photons from the thin disk, and
the Compton y pararneter (:%MaX(T,T2)) gets lower (i.e. the photon index gets steeper; see
middle panel of Figure 8). The innermost radius of the disk is determined by a balance between
the accretion rate and the gas evaporation rate (Meyer, Liu, 85 Meyer—Hofrneister 2000), and
so the innermost radius approaches the ISCO (3R3 (see Section 4.2) corresponding to Tin ~35
km) from around 9.41% (N110 kin) due to a gradual increase of the mass accretion rate.

Shaposhnikov et a1. (2011) showed that the type—C QPO rrns variability increased with
X—ray energy for MAXI J1659—152. Several authors have derived the same results for other
BHCs (e.g. Casella et a1. 2005), naturally implying that the QPO could be of coronal origin.
The Observed LFQPO frequency (1—8 HZ) is too slow to be explained by the dynamical time
scale tdyn (eq.(3.4) in Kate, Fukue, 85 Mineshige 2008:

—1
fdyn:i:v—¢:366 (i) (L) 1.5HZ (2)

where 7“ is the distance to the BH and 11¢ is the Keplerian velocity), but can be explained by
the Viscous time scale tvis (Lynden—Bell 85 Pringle 1974, eq.(3.71) in Kate, Fukue, 85 Mineshige

where 05 is the Viscous parameter and h is the height of the corona). Here, we adopt 05 to be
0.03 (Hawley, Gaininie, 85 Balbus 1995, Matsumote 85 Tajiina 1995, Maehida 85 Matsumote
2008), the scale height of the corona (h/r) to be 1, and the BH mass to be 6 solar Inass (see
Section 4.2). Hence, the corresponding frequency to the radius range of 3 to 9.41%, 2.0—11.0
HZ, is in a good agreement With the Observed frequency at 1—8 HZ.

1f the type—C QPO originates from the neighborhood of the disk truncation radius, we
can explain the Change Of the QPO frequency by a Change Of the innermost radius. In fact, the
Observed Tin-VC correlation (Tin oc VC— 07040.12) is remarkably consistent With the above relation
VC oc 73:115. A larger innermost radius might result in a larger coronal size, that is, a larger
contribution of the hard CPL component, Which has more variability than the disk emission in
the X—ray spectrum. This could explain the anti—Correlation between the QPO frequency and
rins variability as seen in right panel of Figure 10.

In contrast, the frequency of type—B QPOs varied from 1.7 to 4.1 HZ, While the innermost
radius Tin remained constant at ~35 km. The constancy of Tin suggests that the inner edge of
the accretion disk had already reached the ISCO during the type—B QPOs. Thus, a Change Of
the frequency cannot be explained by a Change Of the disk innermost radius. An innermost—
radius independent mechanism (e.g. magnetic reconnection above the thin disk) is necessary
for an explanation of type—B QPOs.

The 2010 outburst of MAXI J1659—152 lasted for about two months, a much shorter
duration than many other black hole systems (typically more than 100 days; McClintOCk 85
Reinillard 2006). This short duration is consistent With the fact that MAXI J1659—152 is a
small system given its relatively short orbital period (~2.41 hours; Kuulkers et al. 2010, 2011).
It should be emphasized that all three previously known BHCs With short orbital periods below
6 hours (Swift J1753.5—0127 (3.2 hours; Zurita et al. 2008), XTE J1118+480 (4.1 hours; Uemura
et al. 2010), and GRO J0422+32 (5.1 hours; Orosz 85 Baylin 1995) remained in the hard state
during the entire duration of their outbursts. This is probably due to a low mass accretion
rate—srnall accretion disks tend to accumulate less matter than larger disks (Meyer—Hofineister
2004). As the hardness—intensity diagram seen in Kalamkar et al. (2011) and Muiios—Darias et
al. (2011) Clearly displays a Q—shaped track during the outburst evolution, MAXI J1659—152
might be the ﬁrst BHC With spectral transitions among the short period BHCs. In addition, all
the sources With very short periods are located at high Galactic latitudes ((l,b):(5.5, +16.5)
fer MAXI J1659—152, (157.7, -|-62.3) fer XTE J1118+480, (24.9, +12.2) for Swift J1753.5—
0127, and (165.9, —11.9) for GRO J0422+32). XTE J1118+480 is thought to be a run—away
Inierequasar Which is moving at a high speed of about 100 km s‘1 (Mirabel et al. 2001), and may

20

"
"21","have been born during a supernova 0n the Galactic disk, and then subsequently moved toward
the Galactic halo by kicks received during the explosion. This might suggest that MAXI J 1659—
152 is also a run—away Inierequasar similar to XTE J1118+480. The leng—terin monitoring of
radio and/or Optical Observations of the MAXI J1659—152 source location with high spatial
accuracy will be useful for determining the origin of this source. Also, the recently discovered
BH transient Swift J1357.2—0933 lies well above the Galactic plane (l,b):(328.7, +50.0) and
stays in the hard state throughout the outburst (Kriinin et a1. 2011). Swift J1357.2—0933 may
thus be a short—peried black hole candidate (Torres et a1. 2011).

4.2. Estimation of black hole mass

We have evaluated the innermost radius using the simpl Comptonizatien model, and
have found that it started at about 110 011000st 2km, where die is the distance in units
of 10 kpe and 2' is the inclination angle, during the initial phase and gradually approached
the constant value of ~35 011000st 2km. This could imply that the innermost radius ﬁnally
reached the ISCO (Ebisawa et a1. 1993). Assuming that the ISCO coincides with three times
the Schwarzsehild radius (3R3), as in the ease of a nen—spinning Schwarzsehild BH, we can
estimate the mass of the central Object in MAXI J 1659—152. However, we note that the Observed
innermost radius (Tin) does not reﬂect a physical radius (Rm) due to two main effects: the MOD
model does not assume the torque—free condition at the innermost radius; and the emergent
spectrum is distorted by a hardening due to the electron scattering, resulting in a blackbody
component with a higher color temperature (T CO1) than the effective temperature (T eff). We
follow the correction method for these two effects that has been developed by Kubota et a1.
(1998)

Steiner et al. (2009b) applied the simpl model to energy spectra taken during interme—
diate states, and showed that the innermost radius can increase when the Compton fraction is
larger than 0.25. SO, using the averaged Tin value of 35.3 km for i=00 and D:10 kpe, weighted
for observations with a Compton fraction smaller than 0.25, we can estimate the BH mass as
follows:

R... : @273... : 59.4 (i) (E) 2 km : 82.6 (i) (E) 2 km, (4)

10kpe cos 60O 10kpe cos 750
where 5 is 0.412 (Kubota et a1. 1998) and H; : % is the spectral hardening factor (1.7: Shimura
& Takahara 1995). Since we assume Rm to be 3R3 (RS:2GM/C2), the Obtained black hole mass
M is
C2Rin D eosz' _% D eosz' _%

M = W : 671(10Tpc) (W) MG : 9.32 (m) (M) M9. (5)
In the ease of a rapidly rotating Kerr black hole, the ISCO approaches much Closer to the black
hole to a minimum of 051%, depending on the spin parameter a. In the maximum rotating
case (a m1), the BH Inass estiinate can be larger by a maximum factor of 6.

21

"
"22","For the mass constraint, we need information for a distance D and an inclination angle 2'
0f MAXI J1659—152. We use estiinates (D >5.3 kpe and i=60—75O) suggested by Kuulkers et al.
(2011) and Kennea et al. (2011). Furthermore, it is known that the therinal—tO—hard transition
will occur at 1—4 % 0f the Eddington luminosity (LE : 1.25X1038MiG erg s_l) in soft X—ray
transients (Maeearone 2003). The Observed ﬂux from the hard state after the transition (MJ D
55508, day 44.1) was 1.97><10_9 erg ern‘2 s‘1 in the 3—50 keV range. This was then converted
to a bOlOInetrie ﬂux of 4.50><10_9 erg ern‘2 s_l, assuming a high energy cutoff at 200 keV.
Using these three constraints, we plotted the allowed BH mass range by Changing the distance
and inclination angle in Figure 11. The BH mass is constrained to 3.6—8.0 M9 in the 5.3—8.6
kpe range.

For more accurate estimations of disk parameters, we applied the kerrbb model (Li et
al. 2005) to the RXTE data instead of the diskbb model. The kerrbb model takes into account
relativistic effects (e.g. light bending around the spinning Kerr BH). The spin parameter a was
poorly constrained for all the Observations, so we ﬁxed a to a value of 0 (i.e. nen—spinning BH).
The ﬁts using this model were reasonable (average X2/d0f : 56.1/73 for 2:600 and 5632/73
fer 2:750). Assuming D:10 kpe, the BH mass is estimated at 6.7 M9 for 2:600 and 9.9 M9
for 2:750, which is in a good agreement with the estimate Obtained from the MOD model
(equation 5). We also applied the kerrbb model to simultaneous Swift and RXTE data in
both period G and period H, when the Compton fraction was lower than 0.25. The ﬁtting
parameters are shown in Table 3. Assuming D=10 kpe for comparison with the MOD results,
the mass is estimated to be 6.18i021 MG (period G) and 5.74:|:0.21 MG (period H) for 2:600,
and 9.09i031 MG (period G) and 8.46i031 MG (period G) for 2:750. The lower limit is
3.27i0.11 MG (period G) and 3.04:|:0.11 MG (period H) for 2' : 600 and D:5.3 kpe. These
results support the conclusion that the primary Object in MAXI J1659—152 is a black hole.

Shaposhnikev et al. (2011) estimated the black hole mass to be 20i3 MG using the
empirical correlation among the photon index F, the LFQPO frequency, and the normalization
in bmc. This value is much larger than our estimated one. This discrepancy could be resolved by
taking into account the BH spin in our estimation, since the BH mass can increase up to 31—42
M9 for the maximum spinning BH (a m1) from 5.1—7.1 M9 for the nen—spinning BH (LL20),
assuming the estimated distance of 7.6 kpc. Fixing the mass at 20MQ, the kerrbb model
ﬁtting for the period G gives a=0.91:|:0.01 for 2:600 and a=0.84:|:0.01 fer 2:750. Dynamic
Inass measurements using Optical Observations are expected give more stringent values, and
will resolve this issue in the future.

5. Summary

We have presented timing and spectral results from 65 RXTE pointed Observations and

"24","1. The outburst lasted about two months, which is shorter than typical outbust duration
of BHCs (more than 100 days). Most Of the Observation epochs are Classiﬁed into the
intermediate state based on deﬁnitions in Reinillard & McClinteek (2006). MAXI J1659—
152 might be the ﬁrst among BHCs with orbital periods shorter than 6 hours to display
spectral transitions.

2. X—ray spectral and timing parameters of MAXI J1659—152 are similar to other black hole
candidates. The energy spectra in both the 0.6—50 keV and 3—50 keV ranges are well
modeled by the MOD model plus a power—law with an exponential cutoff component
modiﬁed with the smeared edge and Galactic absorption. Both type—B and type—C QPOs
were found in the power spectra among 51 Observations, when both the disk and corona
components are securely present.

3. The maximum innermost temperature was ~09 keV. This is low compared to typical
values of Tin Observed in bright BHCs (1.0—1.3 keV). The high energy cutoff was present
at 30—40 keV during the initial phase of the outburst. This may be due to the Compton
cooling of the corona by soft photons at the beginning of the outburst.

4. The central frequency for the type—C QPOs, seen in the range of 1.6—7.3 HZ, is correlated
with the innermost temperature, disk ﬂux, and photon index, and is anti—Correlated with
rins variability and innermost radius. This can be explained by the scenario that the
type—C QPO originates from the truncated disk radius. The type—B QPO frequency varied
from 1.7 to 4.1 HZ while the innermost radius remained constant at 35 km. Hence, the
origin of the type—B QPO is deﬁnitely different from that Of the type—C QPO.

5. Using combined Swift and RXTE data, we found that the innermost radius decreased by a
factor of more than 3 and approached a constant value of 35 km for assumed distance of 10
kpe and inclination of 0 degree during the middle of the outburst. Assuming this constant
value to be the ISCO and the black hole to be n0n—spinning, the black hole mass of MAXI
J1659—152 is estimated at 3.6—8.0 M9, for a distance of 5.3—8.6 kpe and an inclination
angle of 60—750 (Kuulkers et a1. 2011, Kennea et a1. 2011).
