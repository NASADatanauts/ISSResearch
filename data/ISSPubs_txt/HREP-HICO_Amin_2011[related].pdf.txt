ABSTRACT
Clouds cause a serious problem for optical satellite sensors. Clouds not only conceal the ground, they also cast shadows,
which cause either a reduction or total loss of information in an image, by reducing the illumination falling on the
shadowed pixels. Ocean color bio-optical inversion algorithms rely on measurements of remote sensing reﬂectance
(Rn(/i)) at each pixel. [f shadows are not removed properly across a scene, erroneous Rm (2) values will be
calculated for the shadowed pixels, leading to incorrect retrievals of ocean color products such as chlorophyll. The cloud
shadow issue becomes signiﬁcant especially for high-resolution sensors such as the Hyperspectral lmager for the Coastal
Ocean (HlCO). On the other hand, the contrast of pixels in and outside a shadow provides opportunities to remove
atmospheric contributions for ocean color remote sensing. Although identifying cloud is relatively straightforward using
simple brightness thresholds, identifying their shadows especially over water is quite challenging because the brightness
of the shadows is very close to the brightness of neighboring sunny regions especially in deep waters. In this study, we
present automated procedures for our reccntly proposed cloud shadow detection technique called the Cloud Shadow
Algorithm (CSA) and Lee et al. (2007) cloud and shadow atmospheric correction algorithm. We apply both automated
procedurcs to HICO imagcry and show examples of the results.

1. INTRODUCTION
Hyperspcctral information collected by optical satellite sensors can provide important information for various global
remote sensing applications. However, clouds cause a serious problem for these sensors, especially over humid tropical
rcgions. Throughout the year about 2/3 of the Earth’s surface is always covered by the clouds (Belward and Valenzuela,
l99l). The problem for the optical sensor is that clouds not only conceal thc ground but thcy also cast shadows and
these shadows also occur in the observed images along with the clouds. Unlike airborne imaging where shadows can be
minimized by ﬂying at certain times during the day, low Earth orbit satellite-based sensors are limited to acquiring
images at fixed times of the day. If thc solar elevation is low at the time, then the presence of shadow will bc
unavoidable. The main problem caused by shadows is either a reduction or total loss of information in an image (Dare,
2005). Since ocean color algorithms are developed for water pixels illuminated by both direct solar irradiance and sky
light, the radiance values in shadow pixels leads to the corruption of biophysical parameters derived at those pixels.
Cloud shadow can produce errors of 30-40% in the observed reﬂectance from the affected pixels over lands (Simpson
and Stitt, I998). Similar errors can be expected over waters as well although such studies have never been conducted.
Sincc ocean color products are retrieved based on the assumption that the remote scnsing rcﬂectances arc accurate, a
small inaccuracy in the reﬂectance can lead to signiﬁcant errors in the retrieved products. Particularly, since most of the

amplitude can changes the band ratios considerably hence the retrieved products (Amin et al., 2009; Amin et al. 2008).
On the other hand, cloud shadow detection in ocean color scene can be important and beneﬁcial, since cloud shadowed
pixels in combination with pixels in a neighboring sunny region of similar optical properties can be used to remove
atmospheric effects from these scenes (Carder et al., 1992; Lee et al., 2007; Reinersman et al., 1998). These neighboring
sunny pixels can then be used as known reﬂectance targets for validation of the sensor calibration and atmospheric
corrections (Carder et al., 1992; Reinersman et al., 1998).
There are numerous algorithms for cloud detection (Khlopenkov and Trishchenko, 2007; Ackerman et al., 1998; Cihlar
and Howarth, I994; Rossow and Garder, 1993). However, relatively few cloud shadow detection algorithms (Simpson
and Stitt, 1998; Chen et al., 2002; Wang and Ono, 1999; Simpson et al., 2000) has appeared in the literature even though
accurate detection of cloud shadow is important for many atmospheric and terrestrial applications. Most of the shadow
detection algorithms described in the literature deals with shadows over land. Few studies speciﬁcally on shadow
detection over water have been conducted, while shadow detection over water is becoming signiﬁcant as the spatial
resolutions of the ocean color sensors are getting ﬁner. This is because the small scale shadow features appear in the
' acquired images.
The fundamental measurement in ocean color remote sensing is the water-leaving radiance, the upwelling spectral
distribution of the radiance from the ocean. Geophysical parameters such as chlorOphyll can be retrieved from this
water-leaving signal since it contains information about the optically—active components in the water column. However,
only about 10% of the total signal measured by the ocean color sensors contains information about the waters; the rest
represents scattering from aerosols and air molecules. The goal of the atmospheric correction over the ocean is to remove
contributions from the atmosphere and reﬂection from the sea surface.
Gordon and Wang (1994) developed an atmospheric correction scheme for the open ocean where the aerosol
contribution is estimated using Top of the Atmosphere (TOA) radiance/reflectance signals obtained from near infrared
(NlR) bands. This approach assumes that the ocean is optically black in the NIR bands due to the strong water
absorption. Although this technique works well in thc Open ocean, it breaks down in optically complex coastal waters
since thc black pixel approximation no longer holds true due to strong reﬂections from organic and inorganic particulatc
matters. If water-leaving radiancc is not negligible in the NIR bands then the retrieved aerosol loading will be
overestimated, resulting in underestimated or even negative water-leaving radiances. The NlR-iterative procedure for
the coastal waters (Stumpf et al., 2003) can be somewhat helpful in such situation reducing number of pixcls with
negative readings in the coastal waters. More recently, anothcr atmOSpheric correction approach for coastal watcr was
proposed (Wang and Shi, 2005) which uses short wave infrared (SWIR) bands. This approach is based on the fact that
ocean water absorbs strongly in this spectral region, and the contributions of the in-water constituents are negligible and
can safely be considered dark. However, HlCO does not have these SWIR channels. Furthermore, the atmospheric
reﬂectance itself is signiﬁcantly wcaker in SWIR region and spectral features are particularly difficult to resolve. In such
situations, the cloud and shadow (C&S) atmospheric corrections (Lee et al., 2007; Reinersman et al., 1998) can be very
helpful. However, C&S approach is limited to images with cloud and shadow present.
In this paper we present an automated procedure of our recently preposed cloud shadow detection technique called the
Cloud Shadow Algorithm (CSA) (Amin et al., 20] l). Furthermore, we present an automated procedure for the C&S
atmospheric corrcctions (Lee et al., 2007) and test it on HlCO data.
2. BACKGROUND OF THE CLOUD SHADOW DETECTION ALGORITHM
It can be easy to identify the cloud regions simply by using brightness thresholds, but it is difficult to identify the shadow
regions this way bccause their brightness values can be very close to those of their neighbors or some other regions.
Distinguishing shadows over water bodies based on spectral reﬂectance shape and amplitude information is also very
difficult or possibly even impossible (Richter and Muller, 2005). Shadows over water pixels do not have any specific
spectral features while the brightness varies with atmospheric conditions and imaging geometry. Therefore, the
brightness or the spectral shape alone may not be appropriate for shadow detection. However, brightness values from
shadow and close by sunny regions over water can provide a great deal of information if a small portion of the image

"4","(where optical prOpenies of water and atmosphere is uniform) is examined at a time. This is because the water—leaving
radiance over sunny pixels results from both direct and diffuse solar irradiance, while the water-leaving radiance over
shadow pixels results from only diffuse solar irradianee. The path radiance from the shadow pixel to the sensor is also
slightly lower depending on how much of the atmospheric path radiance is shadowed. Therefore, the total radiance at
the TOA measured over the shadow pixels is slightly lower compare to the adjacent sunny pixels. Assuming the optical
propenies of water and atmosphere is homogeneous around shadow and adjacent sunny regions, examining the radiance
difference amongst these small uniform regions together enables us to separate the shadow regions.
Although spectral radiance amplitude of shadow region is slightly lower than the neighboring sunny region, this
difference is relatively small (Amin et al., 201]). Furthermore, because of different path radiance and water-leaving
radiance, the measured radiance from some other sunny region may have exact same or sometimes even lower radiance
than the shadow spectra (Amin et al., 2011 (see Fig. I(c))). Therefore, the spectral shape or amplitude alone is not
adequate enough to separate the two regions. However, to make them separable, the small differences in the spectral
amplitudes particularly in blue-grcen regions can be ampliﬁed by integrating the spectra. The ﬁrst part of our cloud
shadow detection algorithm is to integrate the spectra which we called the Integrated Value (IV) and we deﬁne it as
600nm
IV = jumdz. (1)
400nm
The lV index allows visual separation of the two regions to an observer. However, 1V itself is not adequate to separate
based on a threshold. This is because the 1V index from a shadow region can be very close to, or even higher than, the
1V index of some other sunny regions (Amin et al., 20] 1).
To separate the shadow and sunny pixels using a constant threshold, we normalize the 1V index of the pixel under
investigation, by the mean of the 1V indiees within a spatial Adaptive Sliding Box (ASB) centered on this pixel. The
selection of A83 size is explained aﬂer Eq. 2.
Based on the optical characteristics of the water and atmosphere in the shadow and neighboring sunny region, our cloud
shadow detection technique called the Cloud Shadow Algorithm (CSA) is deﬁned as:
CSA = L, (2)
<1 VASE)
where I V c represents the IV index of the pixel (the central pixel of the A83) which needs to be classiﬁed as a shadow or
sunny pixel. The (IVASB) represents the spatial mean of 1V indiees within the selected ASB of this pixel. This process
should be repeated for all pixels that need to be classiﬁed as shadow or sunny. Note that before applying the CSA,
clouds needs to be removed properly or spurious results can be expected. Additionally, the CSA might break down in
turbid coastal waters since water or even the atmosphere may not be homogeneous within the A88. Thus the CSA is
mainly for deep waters, where atmOSpheric and marine optical prOperties can be assumed homogeneous within the A88.
The ASB needs to be selected carefully so that it only contains shadow and sunny pixels or only sunny pixels. If the
A83 contains only sunny pixels and the pixel under examination is also sunny, the CSA value for this pixel would be
around one since the mean of the A88 and 1V index would be about the same. While if the A88 contains both shadow
and sunny pixels and the pixel under examinations is sunny, the CSA value will be greater than one since the mean of
the A88 will be slightly lower than the 1V index of the pixel under examination. On'the other hand, if the pixel under
examination happens to be shadowed, the CSA value would be less than one since the 1V index 'of this shadow pixel
would be smaller than the mean of the A88. Now, if ASB contains only shadowed pixels, it can be problematic since
the CSA value will be around one, like the case of only sunny pixels. They will be classiﬁed as sunny pixels if the CSA
threshold is put less than one. That is why it is important to select the A88 in such a way so that it is bigger than the
shadowed region. This can be achieved by using the cloud size information which is relatively easy to detect, even using
simplistic brightness thresholds.

"5","3. AUTOMATION AND RESULTS

3.] Shadow Algorithm

The CSA cloud shadow algorithm is developed for homogeneous water bodies such as open waters. Fig. 1 shows the

processing steps of the automated cloud shadow detection using the CSA approach. The ﬁrst step of the shadow

detection is to remove lands, clouds, and non-homogeneous water pixels from the acquired ocean color imagerics. The

input image should only have sunny and shadow pixels from homogeneous water bodies. The next step is to calculate

the 1V indices of the input pixels. Once the 1V indices are calculated, the A88 is selected for each pixel and the CSA

values are calculated. Then using the proposed CSA threshold (CSA<=0.96) (Amin et al., 2011), the shadowed pixels

are soparated from the sunny pixels. Examples of automated shadow detection using the CSA method (using a constant

128 X I28 ASB) are shown in Fig. 2. Left panel of Fig. 2 shows a HlCO image acquired over Virgin Islands on

December 20, 2009 (image size: 270 X 400 pixels) where Fig. 2(a) is the true color image, Fig. 2(b) is the corresponding

IV image and Fig. 2(e) is the corresponding CSA image. Right panel of Fig. 2 is another HICO image acquired over

Samoa Island on October 2, 2010 (image size: 260 X 260 pixels) where Fig. 2(d) is the true color image, Fig. 2(e) is the

corresponding 1V image, and Fig. 2(1) is the corresponding CSA image. The clouds are shown in white on both CSA

and IV images, while the shadows are shown in red on the CSA images and in slightly eoolcr color compare to the

neighboring sunny region on the 1V images. The sunny regions are shown in blue on the CSA image, and in slightly

wanner color compare to the adjacent shadow regions on the 1V images. The true color, 1V and the CSA images agrees
' reasonably well on Fig. 2. The cloud shadows are clearly seen in red structures adjacent to the white clouds on the CSA

images. Also the shape of the cloud shadow especially for the isolated cloud closely follows that of the cloud as

expectcd which reconﬁrms the potential of the CSA method.

and in warmer color on the IV images. The true color, IV and the CSA images agrees pretty well. The Cloud

shadows are clearly seen in red structures adjacent to the white clouds on the CSA images. The shape of the cloud

shadow especially for the isolated cloud closely follows that of the cloud as expected. A l28 >< l28 ASB was used

to created the CSA images.
3.2 Atmospheric Correction Algorithm
The C&S atmospheric correction method (Lee et al., 2007; Reinersman et al., 1998) is appropriate for high-spatial
resolution sensors such as HICO. This approach uses cloud and shadow pixels along with close by sunny pixels with
similar optical properties. First, it estimates the atmospheric and sea-surfaee reﬂectance L001) from a pair of adjacent
pixels that are in and out of a cloud shadow while ignoring the slight (<5%) differences in the remote-sensing reﬂectance
R,s (xl) under the two regions (Lee et al., 1998; Kirk, 1991; Morel and Gentili, 1993; Lee et al., 2004). Estimation of
140(1) also requires an estimate of the ratio between the downwelling sky irradiance to total downwelling irradianee

errors in E (x1) have only very limited effects on L 0 (x1) estimation (Lee et al., 2007). Since the errors m
d

Ed 0% (11) estimation have negligible effects (Lee et al., 2007), Ed 0% (11) were calculated with the default
d d
atmospheric parameters in Radtran. In order to calculate Rrs(/l) , the product of atmospheric transmittance and
downwelling irradianee t(xl)Ed (x1)just above the surface is also needed. For this component the total radiance over
the cloud Ltdd (x1) is used to make the estimate which requires an estimation of remote-sensing reﬂectance ( p) of
observed clouds. The value of p was determined as recommended in (Lee et al., 2007) from a clear water pixel by
assuming R,s (550nm) = 0.0025r_1(Gordon and Clark, 1981). Once the Rm (11) is estimated to account for any
residual contributions from the sky and sea surface, a spectrally constant value is removed from the calculated Rm (1)
in order to obtain an average of zero for the spectral range of 810-840 nm, where contributions from water are
considered null (Mueller et al., 2002).
The processing steps of the automated C&S atmospheric corrections are shown in Fig. 3. The input image for the
automated process should have land and non-homogeneous water pixels removed. The next step is to identify cloud,
cloud shadow, and sunny pixels in the input image. We use a band ratio between the HlCO band 35(548nm) and band
70(748nm) to separate the cloud pixels. After separating cloud pixels, we use the automated CSA cloud shadow
detection approach (see Fig. l) to separate the shadow and sunny pixels. Once cloud, cloud shadow, and sunny pixels
are identiﬁed, we use blob detection to get cloud, could shadow, and sunny blobs. The cloud and cloud shadow blobs
are narrowed down based on the blob size (keeping only blobs with 30 to 300 pixels). From these keeper blobs, we ﬁnd
the closest cloud and cloud shadow blobs based on the distance between the central pixels of each blobs. From the
selected cloud and shadow blobs, we ﬁnd the closest cloud and shadow pixels and take the Ltdd (11) and Ltde(/l.)
respectively averaged over 3X3 pixels. Then from the selected shadow blob, we ﬁnd the closest sunny pixel and take the

clouds and thick cloud shadows respectively. The blue contours on Fig. 4(a) shows thick cloudiblobs while the red
contour shows the thick shadow blobs. The green circle with the arrows labeled with “old“, “sdw“,'and “sny” shows the
automatically selected cloud, shadow, and sunny blobs respectively. The Ltdd (/1) , Ltsdw (/1) and LtW(/1) (Fig. 4(b)
solid spectra) are taken from these selected cloud, shadow, and sunny blobs respectively. The dashed spectra in Fig. 4(b)
are selected manually from another far location (pixel locations: c1d(91, 1622), sdw(99, 1631) and sny(104, 1620))
outside the portion (shown only 380 X 380 pixels of 512 X 2000 pixels) of the image shown in Fig. 4(a). The results
( Rrs(/l) ) from the automatically sclccted and manually selected pixels are show in Fig. 4(c) where blue R“ (/1) arc the
results of automated pixels selection while the red R” (/1) are results of manual pixels selection. These Rm (/1) spectra
are taken from the selected sunny blob labeled with “sny” in yellow (Fig. 4(a)). The agreement between the manually
and automatically retrieved Rm (/1) is very reasonable.

Figure 4. (a) [V image calculated from the HICO image acquired over Samoa Island on October 2. 2010 (image
size: 380 X 380 pixels). Clouds are shown in white and the shadows are shown in slightly cooler color compared
to the surrounding sunny regions. The blue contours show the thick cloud blobs while the red contours show the
thick shadow blobs. (b) The TOA radiance in raw counts of the selected (manually and automatically) from cloud.

4. CONCLUSION
Our preliminary results show that the automated procedures of the CSA cloud shadow detection algorithm and the C&S
atmospheric correction algorithm works reasonably well on selected HICO images. However, further testing with more
images is required to evaluate the overall performance of the automated procedures. The result (remotc-scnsing
reﬂectance) of the automated and manual C&S atmospheric correction agrees very well suggesting that the automated
C&S atmospheric corrections procedure is working. Similarly, the agreement between the true color, IV and the CSA
images suggesting that the shadow detection procedure is also working.
