Abstract
Candida albicans is an opportunistic fungal pathogen responsible for a variety of cutaneous and systemic human
infections. Virulence of C. albicans increases upon exposure to some environmental stresses; therefore, we ex-
plored phenotypic responses of C. albicans following exposure to the environmental stress of low-shear modeled
microgravity. Upon long-term (12-day) exposure to low-shear modeled microgravity, C. albicans transitioned
from yeast to filamentous forms at a higher rate than Observed under control conditions. Consistently, genes
associated with cellular morphology were differentially expressed in a time-dependent manner. Biofilm com-
munities, credited with enhanced resistance to environmental stress, formed in the modeled microgravity bio-
reactor and had a more complex structure than those formed in control conditions. In addition, cells exposed to
low-shear modeled microgravity displayed phenotypic switching, observed as a near complete transition from
smooth to “hyper” irregular wrinkle colony morphology. Consistent with the presence of biofilm communities
and increased rates of phenotypic switching, cells exposed to modeled microgravity were significantly more
resistant to the antifungal agent Amphotericin B. Together, these data indicate that C. albicans adapts to the
environmental stress of low-shear modeled microgravity by demonstrating Virulence-associated phenotypes.
Key Words: C. albicans—LSMMG—Amphotericin B—Irregular wrinkle colony morphology—HARV bioreactor.

3.3. Morphologic switching to “hyper” irregular wrinkle
colony morphology following LSMMG exposure
The term ”phenotypic switching” encompasses the white-
to-opaque switch as well as alterations in colony morphol-
ogy. In the context of these studies, we did not observe the
white-to-opaque switch but did observe a striking change in
colony morphology when cells were cultured under LSMMG
conditions and plated on YPD agar (Fig. 4). An altered
morphology reminiscent of the well-described irregular
wrinkle morphology, yet with dramatically more convoluted
surface ridges (areas of high cell density and areas devoid of
cells), was induced by propagation in LSMMG conditions
(Fig. 4c) (Slutsky et LIL, 1985). The term ”hyper” irregular
wrinkle (HIW) has been coined to describe this highly
convoluted colony morphology, which resembles that pre-
viously described as Morphological form A13 (Brown-
Thomsen, 1968). Cells exposed to control conditions formed
smooth colonies almost exclusively (Fig. 4a), and HIW col-
onies (or any other altered morphologies) very rarely formed
under these conditions, even when cultured for extended
periods of time. When analyzed in long-term LSMMG, there
was a time-dependent increase in the percentage of cells
giving rise to the HIW morphology (Fig. 4e). HIW colonies
were detected at minimal levels by 5 days of culture in
