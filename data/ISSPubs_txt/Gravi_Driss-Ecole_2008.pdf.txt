The GRAVI~1 experiment was brought on board 188 (International Space Station) by Discovery
(December 2006) and carried out in January 2007 in the EMCS facility (European Modular Cultivation
Syetem). her the ﬁrst run of this experiment, tenth seedlings were hydrated and grewn tr: microgravity fer
t5 h and then subjected fer 3.3 h 40 min to centrifugal accelerations ranging from 0.29 x 30'2 g to 0.99 x.
10’2g. Bering the second run? seedlings were grown either fer 30 h 30 min in nnetegtayhy {this sampte
was the control) or for 21 h 30 min and then subjected to centnfugat accelerations ranging from 1.2 x 102
g to 2.0 X10""2gf0r9 h.
tn beth eases? root orientation and root curvature were followed by time lapse phetegraphy. Stih images
were downlinked in near real time to ground (N ~USOC) during the experiment. The positien of the root
tip and the root curvature were analysed as a function of time. h has been shown that in nneregtayéty the
embryonic root curved strongly away from the cotyledons (autemerphegenesis) and then straightened out
slowly from the 17th to the 30th h following hydration (autotropism).
Due to the autotropic straightening of roots in microgravity, their tip was oriented at an angle close to the
optimal angle of curvature (120°-135°) for a period of 2 h during centrifugation. Moreover, it has been
demonstrated that lentil roots grown in microgravity before stimulation were more sensitive than roots
grown in l g (Perbal et a]. 2004). In these conditions, the threshold acceleration perceived by these organs
was found to be between 0 and 2.0 x 10'3 g and estimated punctually at 1.4 x 10'5 g by using the
hyperbolic model for ﬁtting the experimental data and by assuming that autotropism had no or little
impact on the gravitropic response. Gravisensing by statoliths should be possible at such a low level of
acceleration because the actomyosin system could provide the necessary work to overcome the activation
energy for gravisensing.

Different nastie responses of piant organs were described in microgravity or in stmuiated microgravity
(err eltnostats), in absence of any external stimulus. These spontaneous curvatures or changes in grewth
direction have been ea11ed automorphosis (Hoson et al. 1995) 01‘ automorphegenesis (Stankevie et a1.
1998). These movements were different from oscillations which have been observed on the ground
(Sputny 19731; Heathcete 1982; Barlow 1992) as well as in microgravity (Brown and Chapman 1984;
Votkmam et a1. 1986; Antonsen et a1. 1995; Johnsson 1997).

I The effects of simulated microgravity (0n elinostat) 0n the growth of piant organs were reported very
eariy by Larsen (1957) and Johnsson (1966). Larsen described spontaneous curvatures of Artemisia anti
Lepidz’zrm roots depending on the speed of rotation of the eiinostat. Aeeerding t0 tohnsson these
curvatures performed on ehnostat by Lepz’dz'um roots and Helianthus hypeeetyis fetiewed a tandem watk
process that is statistieaiiy randomly distributed movements. in their review Hosen and Sega (2003) have
summarized the occurrence of automorphogenesis on different species grewn on a 3-D elinostat. Two
growth patterns were described for roots depending on the species: a predetermined direction along the tip
of root primordia (rice and garden cress) or a random fashion (maize and pea). Sobick and Sievers (1979)
studied the response of garden cress roots grown on a fast-rotating clinostat. They demonstrated that an
autonomous growth direction of the root occurred which always took place in the same direction as in the
embryo (toward the cotyledons that is adaxially).

In space, roots showed automorphogenesis similar to that observed on clinostat. For the garden cress
(Volkmann et a1. 1986), the root grew out at an angle that followed the direction that its tip was pointing
on in the seed. For rice, roots formed a constant mean angle of about 50° with the axis of the caryopsis
(Hoson et al., 1999). In Lepz'dium roots cultivated in space, Johnsson et a1. (1996) and Antonsen and
Johnsson (1998) confirmed the random origin of the bending. But in these studies the movements of the
root tip were not analysed with respect to the relative position of the root and the cotyledons.

For lentil roots? deviation (bending) of the root tip from their initial position was observed on a slow»
rotating clinostat (Legue et a1. 1992) and in space (Perbal et a1. 1987; Legué et a1. 1996; Perbal et a1.
1996). The roots bent away from the cotyledons and made an average angle of 52.7 0 0n the clinostat and
between 29.3 0 and 155° in space (depending on the duration of the growth period: 25 h and 29 h
respectively). It must be noted that in cress and lentil seeds, the embryo is bent and that the orientation of
the root during growth in space or on a clinostat is opposite in both species: in cress the root curves
toward the cotyledons and in lentil the root curves away from the cotyledons. Thus, the directions of these ,
spontaneous curvatures seem to be species dependent and are not due to an external factor. That is the

teaseh wi’iy the term at autemerphogehesis (Stankovie et ai.’ i998) is abieqeate te quahfy these
spontaneous movements occurring during seed germination in microgravity (or simulated microgravity).
Automorphogenesis is different from autotropism which is related to a straightening of an organ after an
induced curvature (Larsen 1953). For instance the loss of gravitropic curvature (organ straightening) after
the withdrawal of the gwstimulus (in microgravity or on a cliriostat) is due to autotropism (Stankovic et ai.
1998). Autotropism is also different from the organ straightening which occurs during the gravitropic
reaction in the gravitational ﬁeld which was called counter~reactiori (Larsen i962; Perbai arid. Driss-Ecoie
1994) and. appeared to be gravity dependent.
hi opposition to automorphogenesis and autotropism, gravitropism is a response to an extemai stimulus
(gravity). it is generally accepted that gravisensing takes place in special ceiis {statocytes} that possess
amyloplasts (or statoliths) which sediment under the inﬂuence of gravity (herbal 197 8; Volkmanh and
Sievers 1979; Sack 1991) although unspecialised cells could also be sensitive to grayistiihuius
(Woiverton et a1. 2002 a and b). The role of statoliths is controversial since they are considered: 1» as the
graviperceptors (Sack 1997; Kiss 2000; Perbal and Driss~Ecoie 2003) or 2— as bahasts which couid
increase the weight of the whole protoplasm (Wayne and Staves i996 ) which is considered to be
responsible for gravisensing. Starch depleted mutants of Arabidopsis were found to be able to respond to
gravistimulus but less than the wild type (Kiss et a1. 1989; Caspar and Pickard 1989). In the mutant, the
amyloplasts did not settle down under the inﬂuence of gravity (MacCleery and Kiss 1999) which
demonstrated that the sedimentation of these organelles was not necessary or that there could be other
gravisensors.

Very early (see Larsen 1962), Plant Physiologists tried to evaluate the ability of plants to react to slight
gravistimuli i.e. to measure their sensitivity. Gravisensitivity has been estimated by several parameters
Volkmann and Sievers 1979): 1— the presentation time which is the minimal duration of stimulation by
gravity leading to a gravitropic curvature, 2- the perception time which corresponds to a minimal duration
of intermittently repeated stimuli by gravity and 3- the threshold acceleration inducing a gravitropic
response.

The presentation time was estimated by the means of clinostats or in microgravity and was generally
found to be about 20—30 s for roots (Larsen 1957; Kiss et a1. 1989; Caspar and Pickard 1989; Perbal and
Driss-Ecole 1994). More recently, a value of 10 s was proposed by Hejnowicz et a1. (1998) for cress
roots. These authors have also shown that intermittently repeated stimuli of ls in the gravitational field
induced a gravitropic curvature. This result indicated that the perception time could be of the order of 1s,
but shorter values have been proposed for Avena coleoptiles (0.5 s; Pickard 1973).

The use at twe axes ehnestats whteh ean simutate weightlessness by tetatthg ntahts abettt an henzentat
axis and centrifuge them about a vertical axis has permitted to determine the thresho1daeee1etation for
grayisensing of roots (1.3 x 10°4g, Shen-Miller et a1. 1968; 4.3 x 10'3 g, Sobiek and Sievets 1979; 2.6 x
E03 g, Launnayieius et at. 1998) but also to introduce a new parameter, the presentation dose? which
represents the product of the acceleration times the presentation time (expressed in g x s). The
presentation dose was found to be )4 to 22 g x s (Laurinavicius et a1. 1998).
Experiments in microgravity represented a unique opportunity to estimate the threshe1d aeeetetatien fet
grayisensing in roots (Perbal and Driss—Ecoie 2007). The 0n1y experiment done in near weighttessness by
Methys and Laurinavtcius (1990) indicated that this threshotd acceleration sheutd be 1.5 x 104 g.
Howeyen this value was Obtained by extrapolation of the experimentat data by the means Of a
mathematical modei which was not the best one (Perbal et a1. 2002) and by using 0n1y two aceetera‘tions
(10""1 g and 10""2 g). Moreover, it has been demonstrated recentiy that mots grewn tn microgravity were
more sensitive to grayistimulus than mots grown on a 1 g centrifuge Wethmann and Tewinket 1996i,
Perba] et a1. 2004) which could explain the low value of the threshold acceleration determined by Merkys
and Laurinavicius (1990). The presentation dose for cress roots was estimated by Volkmann and
Tewinkel (1996) to be 20-30 g x s.
The goal of the present study was to analyse the mechanism of gravisensing in roots by determining the
threshold acceleration and the presentation dose of the gravitropic reaction of lentil seedlings grown in
microgravity. The seedlings were then subjected to low accelerations for long times (several hours) in
such a way that the angle of stimulation was optimal for gravitropic reaction (tversen and Larsen 1971;
Perbal and Perbal 1976) at least for 2 h. In these conditions gravisensitivity 0f lentil roots should have
been maximal. This study is preliminary to the analysis of free calcium distribution and calcium targeted»

‘ proteins localisation in root cap cells which will be the subject of a next space experiment (GRAVE-Z).

Dry lentil seeds (Lens culinarz’s L. cv Anicia) without their seed coat were ﬁxed with plastic elements on
a piece of cellulose sponge covered with black paper in cultivation chambers (CC; Fig. 1a). The cellulose
sponge was used to keep the water necessary for the germination of the seeds and the black paper to
increase the contrast for infra—red photography. The seeds were oriented in such a way that the embryonic
root was perpendicular to the longitudinal axis of the cultivation chamber and perpendicular to the
centrifugal acceleration (Fig. 1b, arrow). Each CC contained 24 seeds (12 on the top and 12 on the bottom
side) and was closed by a gas permeable membrane (Biofoil) and a transparent window. The experiment

were placed on each of the two rotors 0f the EMCS facility.

After hydration and for the ﬁrst run (Fig. 2), the seeds germinated and developed during 15 h in
meregravity (0n hen rotating centrifuges). Then (during 13 h 40 min) the gravity gradient along the axis
of the BC was used to expose lentil roots to different aeeeteratteh forces. The ranges of aeee1erattens
were: 0.29 x 102 g to 0.50 x 10% (ﬁrst centrifuge) and 0.58 x 10'2g to 0.99 x t02 g (second centrifuge).
Bunng the second run, one centrifuge was static (nncrogravity eentrot; 30 h 30 min). Due to a break
down of EMCS we were obliged to modify the speed of the second rotor {the range of aeeeteratiens used
was: 1.2 x. 10'2 g to 2.0 x 10""2 g) and the period of centrifugatieh tasted 0h1y 9 h after 21 h 30 mm 01""
microgravity (Fig. 2). Due to the timing difference from the ﬁrst run, the second. run was not taken into
account fer the calculation of the threshold acceleration.

During the whole experiment root grewth was recorded by ttme~1apse phetegraphy under inframred hght
(one shot every 20 min). Still images of the top of the cultivation chambers with 1ent11 seedlings were
forwarded to us almost in real time (Fig. 3a). After the stop of the centrifuges, the astronaut Sunita
Williams photographed both sides of the CC with a Kodak-Nikon camera (DCS760). The images were
also forwarded to us rapidly (Fig. 3b). All pictures were treated by a speciﬁc program (Image J,
http://rsb.inf0.nih.gov) in order to measure the orientation, 0, of the root tip (Fig. 4; angle between the
initial orientation, i0, and the ﬁnal orientation, f0, 0f the root extremity) and the curvature, c, of the root
(difference between the orientation of the base of the root and the orientation of the root tip). The initial
orientation was considered as zero. The centrifugal acceleration (y) was applied perpendicularly to the
initial orientation of the root and the values of the angles were counted positively or negatively when the
root curved respectively toward the cotyledons or away from them.

A control was run on a slow rotating clinostat (0.4 rpm) in our laboratory. The roots were oriented
parallei t0 the axis of rotation of the clinostat.

Root growth and automorphogenesis in microgravity

Previous experiments carried out in Biorack have indicated that in microgravity the lentil root curved
away from the cotyledons (Perbal et a1. 1987; Perbal et a1. 1986; Legué et a1. 1996) but this observation
was done after 25 h or 29 h of growth. In the present experiment, records of root growth were obtained by
time 1apse photography since the beginning of the seed germination. Moreover, there was more space for
the root tip to deviate from its initial orientation than in the Biorack experiments due to the positioning of

seeds in the etttttyattoh ehamhets (Fig. 1a). As soon as .6 h aftet hythattott, the toet began to etttye very
strongly away from the eotyiedons (Fig. 5a and b) and formed a hook (automotphogehesis) with a
maximal bending at about 17 h. This bending mainly occurred at the 1eve1 of the hypoeotyi base (Fig. 4,
t1) and to a lesser extent at the level of the elongation zone of the toot itsetf. Then, strong toot e1ohgation
and a parahei straightening (autotropism) of this organ took place. After 22 h 30, autottopism maihty
occurred at the basis of the hypocotyl (Fig. 5a, white arrow} which ted to the continuation of the reduction
of the bending due to automorphogenesis. At 30 h 30 min the root tip almost reached its initia1 orientation
(Fig. 5a, 6 h 50 min). Just before the end of the period of straightening, the root tip sltghtiy oseiiiated
(Fig. 5b, between arrows).

As the formation of the hook in microgravity was never observed on the ground, it eouid be argued that it
was due to anisotropy within the cultivation chamber because of microgravity. 1t is weii known that in
this condition, convection of gases does not occur for instance. ht order to determine whether physieai
factors were responsible for the formation of the hook, lentit seediittgs were grown on a slow totatittg
chnosta’t (04 rpm) for 25 h in the same cultivation chambers as in space. Figure 6 demonstrates that a
hook was also formed on the clinostat, despite the fact that there could not be any anisotropy (watering,
gases) due to the effect of mixing induced by the rotation of the cultivation chambers. This result
indicated that: 1- the hook was due to automorphogenesis which is normally hidden by gravitropism on
the ground and 2- the clinostat could be a good simulation of microgravity at least for the study of this
phenomenon.

Threshold acceleration

Figure 7 presents an example of the movement of a root grown in microgravity for 15 h and then
subjected to a centrifugal acceleration (y) for 13 h 40 min (Fig. 2, Run 1). When the centrifuge started the
root tip was oriented in the opposite direction to the centrifugal acceleration (Fig. 7, y), that is at about
180° with respect to 7. However, due to the straightening of the root dun'ng the following hours, its tip
was more and more obliquely oriented with respect to the y vector and reached an angle of 135° at 21 h
50 min and of 115° at 23 h 50 min. It is well known that for roots stimulated in the gravitational ﬁeld on
earth the orientation of the root with respect to gravity at 120°~135° (Perbal and Perbal 1976) is optimal
for gravisensing. Thus, in this space experiment the orientation of the root with respect to y should be also
optimal for the period between 21 h 50 min and 23 h 50 min. Moreover, in previous experiments (Perbai
et all. 2004), it has been shown that gravisensitivity of lentil roots was greater for roots grown in
microgravity than in 1 g before stimulation. ’

The gtavittepte teaetieh at .27 h 50 min (Fig. 7:, CV) was mathty teeatett he the hhadte part at the toot. The
angie of curvature of roots subjected to various centrifugai accelerations was compared to the angle of
curvature of roots grown continuously in microgravity (Table 1). Anova and t tests (see 1egend of Table
1) demonsttated that the residuai bending due to automorphogenesis in microgravity and gtavittopie
eutyatute due to a 0.313 x 10""2 g acceleration was statistically different. Consequentiy the threshoid
aeeeietatien of gravisensing was less than this acceleration level.
1n order to determine this threshoid we used two mathematieat modeis which are eommonty utihzed for
this purpose (Fig. 8a and b): the iogarithmic and the hyperboiic modeis (a theoretieat analysis of these
modets can be found in Perbai et a1. 2002). 1t is known that the ﬁrst one better tits data corresponding to
middie range stimulations whereas the second one is good for very low stimutations (Benttup 1979). Th
this experiment, it could be indeed considered that the lentii roots were subjected to tow stimulations. As
expectedthe hyperbolic model fits better (Fig. 8b; correlation coefﬁcient: 0.999) the experimentat data
than the iogartthmie model (Fig. 8a; correlation coefﬁcient; 0.984). The threshoht aeseietation et
gravisensing was estimated by extrapolation of the hyperbolic modei and was found to be 1.4 x 10‘5 g. 11:
was calculated with the equation given in ﬁgure 8b. For doing this calculation it was assumed that the
interaction between autotropic straightening and gravitropic curvature was weak and that the bending
registered for zero stimulation was -6.0° (angle of curvature after 30 h of growth in microgravity; see
Table 1). The ﬁrst assumption is acceptable since autotropism occurred mainly at the basis of the
hypocotyl (Fig. 5, between 22 h 30 min and 30 h 30 min, white arrow) whereas the curvature due to
gravitropism was observed in the middle part of the root (Fig. 7, 27 h 50 min, CV). The second assumption
could be controversial since the interval of conﬁdence of the curvature was —6.0° i 4.70. The lower limit
(—10.7) led to a negative value of the threshold acceleration which makes no sense and the upper limit (—
1.3) to a threshold of 2.0 x 10'3 g. Our punctual estimation (1.4 x 10'5 g) was about 10 times 1633 than the
value obtained by Shen—Miller et al. (1968; 1.3 x 10'4 g) with a two axes clinostat (estimated in a
completely different way) or by Merkys and Laurinavicius (1990; 1.5 x 10'4 g) in the frame of a space
experiment in which the logarithmic model was used. It is interesting to note that the threshold estimated
for our experiment by the logarithmic model (Fig. 8a, 1.9 x 10'3 g) is not so close to that obtained by these
authors. In any case the hyperbolic model should be preferred because it has been shown previously to be
better for almost all the data published in the literature on gravisensitivity (Perbal et a1, 2002).
From these results, the theoretical threshold dose of gravistimulus could be calculated (see legend Fig. 8).
The lentii roots were centrifuged for 13 h 40 min (49200 s), the punctual estimation of the threshold
acceleration being 1.4 x. 10""5 g, the estimated threshold dose should be: (1.4 x 10'5 g) x (49200 s) = 0.67 g
x s.

ht this study we demonstrated that for lentil roots grown in microgravity a strong teacticn 0f
autcmctphogenesis occurred during the period between 6 h and 17 h aﬁet hydration: the roots curved
away from the cotyledons (that is abaxially) making a hook mainiy due t0 the bending of the basis of the
hypocotyl. This reaction of automorphogenesis occurred also on a stow chhostat which indicated that any
anisotropy of the spatial environment could not be at the ortgih of this movement. This cm‘yatUte cculd be
due to an anatomical difference between the two sides of the mots Beading t0 a quicker hydration at one
side compared to the Opposite side. However it must be stressed that two bent embryos (Lepz‘dz'um
scztz'vum; Lens culinaris) do not react in the same way since the garden cress root grows adaxially in
microgravity (Volkmann et a1. 1986) and the lentil root abaxially (Perbal et a1. 1986). Johnsson et a1.
(1996) stated that difference in growth parameters or membrane transport parameters between different
cells or slight deviations in hormone sensitivity among the cells could be responsible for this movement.
Hoson et a1. (1995) found another cause for the curvature of clinostated coleoptiles: a difference of cell
wall extensibility between the convex and the concave sides which could be due to inherent difference in
the extension capacity (Hoson and Sega, 2003).
For lentil roots grown continuously in microgravity the reaction of automorphogenesis was followed by a
strong elongation and a straightening during the period between 17 h and 30 h aﬁer hydration. The
straighthening occurred ﬁrst at the level of the root itself and was followed by the straighthening of the
basis of the hypocotyl. This movement corresponded to “autotropism” (Larsen 1953) and t0 the :
straightening described by Antonsen and J ohnsson (1998; phase II) for Lepidium roots grown
continuously in microgravity. This straightening occurring without any former gravitropic stimulation
was also observed in coleoptiles grown on clinostat (Nick and Schafer 1989).
In this study we estimated the threshold acceleration for the gravitropic response of lentil roots grown in
microgravity and stimulated 0n centrifuges in good conditions for studying gravisensing (seedlings roots
grown in microgravity before stimulation and at an angle close to 120-»135O for about 2 h; Fig. 7, 21 h 50
min to 23 h 50 min). The seedling roots were stimulated during the period of autotropism straightening
which could have had an impact on the gravitmpic response since both tropisms induced a movement of

case, no estimate of the threshold acceleration should be possible since the effect of the interaction could
not be measured and in the second case the threshold which was calculated should have been
overestimated. However, the straightening mainly occurred at the level of the hypeeetyl between 22 h 30
min and 30 h 30 min (Fig. 5) whereas the gravitropic reaction was located at the teat of the toot tip (Fig.7.
27 h 50 min).Thus, the interaction between both tropisms at that moment should have been weak.
1 his threshold. was found to be between 0 and 2.0 x 10‘3 g by taking into account the interval of
eentidenee bf the angle of curvature of roots grown in microgravity (- 6.00 :1: 4.70;, Tabie 1). it has been
estimated punctually at 1.4 x 10'5 g. The minimal stimulation dose which could be perceived by these
organs at such a low g level should be 0.67 g x s. This value was much less than the presentatieh deses
found in the literature (20~30 g x s) and corresponded better to the perception doses found previously for
Avena coleoptiles or cress roots (Pickard 1973, 0.5 g x. s; Hejhowicz et a1. 1998, 1 g x s). This meant that
roots could perceive stimulus of the order of 1 g x 3 even if they teact (curve) only when they ate
subjected to greater stimuli. The presentation time or presentation dose should therefore be related to the
impossibility of the organ to curve below a certain level of stimulation and should be due to a kind of
“resistance” to bending (Pickard 1973) and not only dependent on the perception phase.

. It has been several times pointed out (Bjérkman 1988; Hejnowicz et al.1998) that the work done by the
gravity force on a statolith settling down (see Appendix) should at least exceed the thermal noise (TN:
l/2KT= 2 x 10 ’21 J, where T is the absolute temperature and K is Bolzman’s constant) and even be
greater than the activation energy for gravisensing (3-4 x 10'20 J ; Bjerkman 1988). For the lentil root, this
calculated work is 5.5 x 10""19 J (see Appendix 1). As shown by ijrkman (1988), the movement of one
amyloplast should be sufﬁcient to trigger gravistimulus. In the case of our space experiment, the threshold
acceleration should be 1.4 x 10'5 g and the work done by this acceleration on one amyloplast should be
7.5 x 10’24 J (Appendix 2). Even if the group of 20 statoliths which are in one statocyte are considered
together, the total work done by the centrifugal force on them (1.6 x 10'22 J) should not be sufficient to
reach the necessary level of the activation energy. Thus such a low level (1.4 x 10'5 g) appeared to be
physically unable to induce a gravitropic stimulus.

However, all these calculations do not take into account the fact that there are forces exerted by the
actomyosin system on statoliths (Volkmann et al. 1991; Driss—Ecole et a1. 2000) in microgravity i.e. in
absence of any acceleration. These forces which move the amyloplasts in microgravity are of the order of
1.6 x 10'14 N (Driss-Ecole et a1. 2000). Due to the orientation of actin ﬁlaments in the statocyte (Perbal
and Driss—Ecole, 2003) the forces are oriented obliquely with respect to the longitudinal axis of the
statocyte. When the roots are subjected to a low acceleration (for instance, 1.4 x 10""""5 g), the force created ’
by centrifugation (1.5 x 10'18 N; Appendix 2) is negligible compared to the force exerted by the

for several hours and is responsible for the directional information which Reads to the differentiai growth.
When the actomyosin system has the same direction as the centrifugal force, the work done by both
forces on oniy one statohth moving 5 pm could not be less than 8 x 1020} (Appendix 3), which is greater
than the presumed activation energy (3-4 x '10‘20 J). So, it is possibie that the actomyosin system provides
a part of the work necessary to overcome the thermal noise and the activation energy. The high sensitivity
of seedling toots grown in microgravity and subjected to very tow eentrit‘ugations should be due to the
ihyoiyemeht of these elements of the cytoskeleton in gravipereeption. 9h earth, when the roots are
stimuiated by gravity, the role of the cytoskeleton should be smaller since the gravity force (Appendix ”1)
is seven times greater than the force exerted by the actomyosin system (Appendix 3).
it must be noted that calculations done by Wayne and Staves (1996) showed that the protopiasm of one
statocyte falling 10‘""9 m dissipated 5 x 10""21 J when the root was subjected to stimulation by earth gravity.
The same calcutations could prove that with threshold aceeietation {in 0th study the maximat value being
2.0 x 10""3 g) the energy dissipated is too low (5 x 10""21 3' x 2.0 x. 103 g = t x 1023 J) to trigger
gravistimulation which indicates that the protoplasm should not be responsible for gravisensing in roots
subjected to low accelerations but does not discard the possibility of a role of the protoplasm in Chara
cells or in roots stimulated in 1 g. Thus, our results support the statolith theory and an involvement of
actomyosin in gravisensing. However studies with drugs which disrupt the actin network (cytochalasins
and latrunculin B) have shown that this treatment did not inhibit the gravitropic reaction (Blancaflor and
Hasenstein 1997; Staves et a1. 1997; Perbal and Driss-Ecole 2007) and that actin ﬁlaments could act by
continuously resetting the gravitropic-signaling system (Hou et a1. 2004).
The reason for so low threshold acceleration for perception of gravity is not quite clear since the earth
gravity has surely not changed signiﬁcantly during the evolution of land plants. The only reason for this
high sensitivity of roots resides in the fact that a strong and fast gravitropic reaction of the root is
absolutely necessary when the seed germinates because this organ needs to enter the soil very quickly to
ﬁnd water and minerals.

it has been shown that oniy the potential energy of a, mass (protoplasm or arnyiopiast) oouid be used; to
trigger gravistimu1us (Bjotkmant 1988). The work W done by the gravity force on such a mass is equai
tozwxmxgxh or W=Fxh

where m is the mass in kg, g is earth gravity (9.81 111 3’2), h is the distance (in tn) the mass moves in the g
direction? F is the force (in N).

1— Work done by the gravity force on one amyloplast moving 5 pm. According to Driss-Ecole et a1
(2000), the force exerted by gravity (1 g) on an amyloplast is 1.1 x 10'13 N. The work done by this
movement should be:

w =11 x10""13 N x 5 x10'6m = 5.5 x1019]

2- Work done by the centrifugal acceleration (1.4 x 10'5 g) on one amyloplast moving 5 pm. The force
exerted by this acceleration on one amyloplast is:

F = 1.1 x 10'13 N x1.4x10'5 =15 XIO'18 N

The work done should be:

w = 1.5 x1018 N x 5 x10’6m= 7.5 x10'24J

3-— Work done by the actomyosin system to move one amyloplast of 5 pm

run, 4 experimentai containers (BC with 2 cultivation chambers, CC, in each) were pieced on each 0f the
two rotors 0f the EMCS facility. For the ﬁrst run the seeds germinated and devetoped during 15 h in
microgravity (that is on the non rotating centrifuges). Then the centrifugation started and lasted 13 h 40
min. For the second run 4 EC, placed on a non rotating centrifuge, were subjected to 30 h 30 min of
microgravity. The other 4 EC were subjected to 21 h 30 min of microgravity and 9 h of centrifugation.
During the whole experiment root growth was followed by Video recording and time-lapse photography
(one shot every 20 min) under infra-red light. At the end of each run the astronaut Sunita Williams
photographed both sides of the CC (at 30 h for the ﬁrst run and 32 h for the second run).

minutes are indicated on the 1eft); 13/ Position of the root tip checked every 40 min (black dots) between 6
h and 30 h of hydration. The lack of measurements between 18 h and 21 h 40 min is due to the break
down of EMCS which had no impact on the sample grown eontinuousiy in microgravity. At the
beginning of the growth in microgravity the root makes a strong hook in the opposite direction to the seed
(automorphogehesis) and the curvature mainly occurred at the junction between the root and the
hypoeotyi. Then the root straightens up ﬁrst and then (between 22 h 30 min and 30 h 30 min) autottopism
took piaee at the 1eve] of the hypoeotyi basis (white arrow). The root tip almost reaches its initiai
orientation after 30 h. The root shghtly oscillates during the period. between the arrows.

(Statistica 7, StatSoft). The ﬁt with the Hyperbolic model (r = 0.999) is better than with the Logarithmic
model (1' = 0.984).

The threshold value was calculated with the equation given in ﬁgures a and b and by considering that for
zero stimulation the curvature was —6.0° (angle of curvature after 30 h of growth in microgravity; see
Table 1). Threshold value for the logarithmic model (a): 1.9 X 10""3 g; for the hyperbolic model (b): 1.4 x
