paper, we have examined the survivability 0f Deinococcus spp. under the environmental
conditions in 188 in orbit (i.e., long exposure to heavy-ion beams, temperature cycles,
vacuum and UV irradiation). A One-year dose of heavy-ion beam irradiation did not affect
the Viability of Deinococcus spp. within the detection limit. Vacuum (10—1 Pa) also had little
effect on the cell Viability. Experiments to test the effects of changes in temperature from
80 0C to —80 0C in 90 min (i80 oC/90 min cycle) or from 60 0C to —60 0C in 90 min
(i60 oC/90 min cycle) on cell Viability revealed that the survival rate decreased severely by
the i80 oC/90 min temperature cycle. Exposure of various thicknesses of deinococcal cell
aggregates to UV radiation (172 nm and 254 nm, respectively) revealed that a few hundred
micrometer thick aggregate of deinococcal cells would be able to withstand the solar UV
radiation on 188 for 1 year. We concluded that aggregated deinococcal cells will survive the
yearlong exposure experiments. We propose that microbial cells can aggregate as an ark for
the interplanetary transfer of microbes, and we named it ‘massapanspermia’.

Introduction

The Viability of life in space and the possibility of transfer of life between the Earth and
extraterrestrial bodies have been actively pursued as research targets in various areas
including astronomy, cosmology, planetary sciences, and biology. This transfer process is
called panspermia, which was proposed by Arrhenius (1903). He proposed that the
interplanetary transfer of single spores is propelled by radiation pressure from the Sun.

To evaluate the panspermia hypothesis, feasibility of natural interplanetary exchange of
microbes inside rocks as the result of natural impacts, a process which is known as
‘lithopanspermia’ 0r ‘transpermia’ (Mileikowsky et al. 2000; Nicholson et al. 2000; Clark
2001; Horneck et al. 2002; Zagorski 2007; Fajardo—Cavazos et al. 2007; Cockell 2008;
Nicholson 2009; Onofri et al. 2012), has been tested both theoretically and experimentally.
The scenario of lithopanspermia consists of several phases: rocks ejected from a certain
planet (e. g. the Earth or Mars), transport of microbes through the space for a long period,
and ﬁnally, landing on another planet (Gladman et al. 1996; Mileikowsky et al. 2000;
Horneck et al. 2008; Nicholson 2009).

"3","The Possible Interplanetary Transfer of Microbes

Since the 1960s, various space exposure experiments have been conducted to determine
the survivability of microbes and fungi during the transfer in space. Accordingly, various
types of microbes have been exposed to selected combined space conditions outside the
Earth’s magnetic ﬁeld (Apollo 16) or in low Earth orbit (LEO): in onboard missions of Spacelab
1, Spacelab D2, ERA 0n EURECA, LDEF and BIOPAN 0n FOTON as well as in EXPOSE-E,
EXPOSE-R, BIORISK and EXPOSE-R which is in progress on the International Space Station
(188) (BaranOV et a1. 2009; Horneck et a1. 2010; Olsson-Francis and Cockell 2010;
Rabbow et a1. 2012; de Vera et a1. 2012).

Environmental parameters in LEO—such as extreme vacuum (10_4~10_6 Pa), intense
solar ultraviolet (UV) radiation, various components of cosmic radiation, and high and low
temperatures—affect the genetic stability of microbes (Mennigmann 1989). For example,
spores of Bacillus subtilis in a multi-layer survived under solar UV radiation for about
6 years though all the spores of B. subtilis in a monolayer were killed (Horneck 1993;
Horneck et a1. 1994). The result suggested that microbe spores might survive for a long
period if the spores are shielded from intense solar radiation (Horneck et a1. 2001).

As described in Yamagishi et a1. (2008), we have proposed to conduct experiments on
capture and space exposure of microbes at the Exposure Facility of J apanese Experimental
Module (JEM) of ISS (Tanpopo mission). In this mission, we are going to expose various
microbes in space including the deinococcal species. Deinococci are known to be extremely
tolerant against ionizing radiation, UV, desiccation and oxidative stress (Anderson et a1.
1956; Battista 1997; Daly 2009; Slade and Radman 2011). In fact, D. radiodurans has been
tested in space in EURECA mission (Dose et a1. 1995). When the cells were exposed to
4><105 kJ/ni2 light (175 nm to 340 nm) under argon or space vacuum, they did not survive the
mission. When a single layer ofD. radiodurans cells (108 cells) was exposed to extreme UV
(A=30.4 nm) radiation and space vacuum during the rocket ﬂight for few minutes or seconds,
the exposure to extreme UV radiation decreased their survival by an extra order of magnitude
below their desiccation tolerance (Saffary et a1. 2002).

Some deinococcal species, such as Deinococcus aerius and Deinococcus aetherius, have
been isolated from the high atmosphere (Yang et al. 2009a, 2010). Among these two species,
the D. aerius exhibited resistance to y ray irradiation that was similar to that of the D.
radiodurans, whereas the D. aetherius exhibited higher resistance to gamma—ray irradiation than
the D. radiodurans. These species also show high resistance to UV radiation (Yang et a1. 2008).
Thus, these bacteria might be able to survive in the space environment.

In this study, we have examined the survivability of three deinococcal species (D.
radiodurans, D. aerius, and D. aetherius) to evaluate whether they are suitable candidates
for the space exposure experiments on 188.

Materials and Methods

Strains and Cell Culture

D. radiodurans strain R1 (ATCC 13939) was purchased from American Type Culture

Collection. D. radiodurans was cultured overnight in mTGE medium (1 % Bacto tryptone,

0.6 % beef extract, 0.2 % glucose) at 30 0C in an incubator with shaking at 150 rpm until it

reached the stationary phase. D. aerius strain TR0125, isolated from the high atmosphere

(Yang et al. 2009a), was cultured for about 7 days in mTGE medium at 30 0C with

shaking at 150 rpm to stationary phase. D. aetherius strain ST0316, isolated from the

lower stratosphere (Yang et a1. 2010), was cultured at 30 0C 0n mTGE agar plates

supplemented with 1 % glycerol for about 2 weeks, as this strain hardly grows in a
liquid medium.
Sample Preparation
D. radiodurans and D. aerius cells were collected from their respective liquid cultures by
centrifugation at 3,000 rpm for 10 min at 4 0C. D. aetherius cells were collected from the
upper parts of the colonies growing on the plate using a platinum 100p. These cells were
washed with 10 mM potassium phosphate buffer (PB: pH 7.0) and the cells were collected
by centrifugation at 3,000 rpm for 10 min at 4 0C. This process was repeated three times. The
optical density (OD590nm) of each cell suspension was measured using a spectrophotometer
and the measured optical density was used to estimate cell concentration. Calibration curves
are shown in Fig. 1.
Heavy-ion Beam Irradiation
Heavy-ion beam irradiation was performed at the Heavy Ion Medical Accelerator at Chiba
(HIMAC) in the National Institute for Radiological Science. Helium (He) ion (150 MeV/u,
2.2 keV/urn) and Argon (Ar) ion (500 MeV/u, 90 keV/urn) beams were used for irradiating
the cells. For this purpose, each cell suspension (20 01) was placed in a test tube (1.3 cm
diameter, 10 cm length and 8 mm inner diameter, IWAKI). The samples were air-dried for
18 h at room temperature. The amount of the sample, 20 pl, was sufﬁcient to obtain
reproducible results, comparing the larger volume. After irradiation, cells were resuspended
in 200 pl of 10 mM PB. The heavy-ion beam was irradiated 0n deinococcal cells at room
temperature. The cell suspension was serially diluted with PB, and the diluted cells were
spread on rnTGE agar plates. The plates were incubated at 30 0C for 3 days, 7 days, and
2 weeks for D. radiodurans, D. aerius, and D. aetherius, respectively. Control samples were
not irradiated but treated, as is the case with irradiated sample.
Temperature Cycles and Vacuum
Aluminum plates containing cylindrical wells (1.5 mm diameter, 2 m depth) with ﬂat ﬂoor
were manufactured as sample holders (Fig. 2). The aluminum plate is made of duralumin
(JIS: A2024-T3), and surface of the plates were anodized. The aluminum plate was dry-heat
sterilized at 180 0C for 4 h. Aliquots (3 pl) of cell suspension containing approximately 105

Fig. 2 Diagram showing the design of the aluminum plate sample holder that was used in the exposure
experiments (i.e. exposure to temperature cycle, vacuum and UV irradiation). Cells were put into each well
(well size: 1.5 mm><2.0 mm)
to 108 cells/ml were applied to and dried in each well three times with appropriate time
intervals, and subsequently the cell aggregate was further air—dried for 18 h at room
temperature. The thermal cycle device (Fig. 3a) was used for the thermal cycle experiment
as described in Takahashi et al. (2011). Experimental conditions were as follows. Temperature
was changed from 80 0C to —80 0C or from 60 0C to —60 0C in a 90 min cycle. A typical
temperature proﬁle is shown in Fig. 3b. Each thermal cycle consisted of cooling for 20 min,
stopping of the machine for 25 min, followed by heating for 20 min, and stopping of the
machine for 25 min, in total 90 min. All temperature cycle experiments were performed under
vacuum (<10_1 Pa). Aluminum plates were retrieved after 0, 1, 112, 224 or 448 cycles. In
vacuum exposure experiments, Deinococcus spp. were exposed to vacuum (<10_1 Pa) for 0, 7,
14 or 28 days. After the treatment, dried cells in each well were resuspended and recovered by
adding 3 pl of PB to each well. The recovery process was repeated for 5 times by adding PB t0
the well, and the recovered suspensions were combined and used for colony counting. In
temperature cycle and vacuum experiment, for the control sample, air-dried cells were
resuspended 0n the day 0 0f the temperature cycle and vacuum experiments. The cells were
analyzed using the same method described above.
UV Exposure
Aluminum plates with wells described above were used for UV irradiation experiment
(Fig. 2). To know how many cells are needed to ﬁll up the well, aliquots of the cell
suspension were dropped into the wells and air-dried. This process was repeated until the
well was completely ﬁlled with air—dried cells. The cells were recovered from each well by
using PB. Recovered cells were then used for colony counting as described above. The
number of air-dried D. radiodurans, D. aerius, and D. aetherius cells needed for ﬁlling up
the well (2 mm) was approximately 8.4><108, 6.1><108, and 7.0><108 cells, respectively.

Monochromatic UV light (VUV172 nm or UVC254 nm) was used to irradiate deinococcal
cells under vacuum (approximately 10—2 to 10—3 Pa). For VUV172 nm irradiation, monochro-
matic light (172i7 nm) from a head-on type lamp (model UER20H-172, Ushio Corp.)
equipped with an MgFZ window at the lamp end was used (Hirose et al. 2002). For UVC254
nm irradiation, a mercury lamp was used. A sample plate was placed on a supporter in the
vacuum chamber at a ﬁxed distance from the lamp. The UV intensity at this distance was
measured using a photodiode before and after each irradiation experiment. A control sample
plate covered with aluminum foil was placed in the chamber away from irradiation area.

When the irradiation experiment was initiated, the pressure inside the vacuum chamber
was kept at approximately 10—2 to 10—3 Pa. The sample plates were exposed to UV for
different periods, up to 17 h and 71.7 h for VUV172 nm and UVC254 nm, respectively. After

for colony counting as described above. Surviving fraction was calculated as the ratio of
counted cells from the irradiated sample and the respective mock-irradiated control sample
that was placed inside the UV chamber under dark.
Survival Curve Fitting for UV—Irradiated Samples
The nonlinear relationship between the survival rates of the Deinococcus spp. against
VUV172 nm and UVC254 nm irradiation was determined by curve ﬁtting. When the
deinococcal cells were irradiated with UV, the intensity of UV at the surface of cells was
deﬁned as 10 and the intensity of UV that affecting the cells was deﬁned as I. 1 depends on
the depth (thickness) of cells 61 and the absorption coefﬁcient 0: (”m_l) and can be described
using the Beer—Lambert’s law (Eq. 1).

The survival rate 51 0f the layer of cells at depth d depended on the energy E and the

D10 is the radiation dose that decreased the number of cells to 10 % 0f the original number.

Results
Heavy-ion Beam
Heavy ions are believed to induce damage to numerous targets within the cells in the space
environment. To determine the survivability 0f deinococcal species against the heavy ion
beam irradiation, we irradiated the dehydrated deinococcal cells with helium ions
(He; 150 MeV/u) and argon ions (Ar; 500 MeV/u) under normal pressure at room
temperature. After irradiation, we calculated the D10 values from the survival curves
(Table 2). The D10 values for the He-ions were higher than that for the Ar-ions.
Among the three species tested, D. aetherius was most tolerant to heavy-ion beams
and D. aerius was least tolerant. Therefore, it was estimated that one-year dose of
heavy ion beams have little effect on the Viability of Deinococcus spp. (Table 2).

experiment was determined based on the temperature model calculated for the Tanpopo
apparatus placed in the Exposure Facility 0f JEM on 188 (data not shown). The effects of
temperature changes from —80 0C to 80 oC and from —60 0C to 60 0C in a 90 min cycle
under 10—1 Pa were examined (Fig. 3b). After 5,840 temperature cycles, which corresponded
to a year of exposure to temperature variation, D10 values and survival rates of all three
species were determined and the results are summarized in Table 3. D. aetherius was the
most resistant and D. aerius was the least resistant species against the temperature cycles.
However, the survival rates for the three species following the —60 0C to 60 oC temperature
cycle were similar (Fig. 4).
Vacuum
Deinococcal cells were exposed to continuous vacuurn(10_1 Pa) for up to 28 days, and then
their survival rates were determined. As shown in Fig. 5, even after 28 days under vacuum,
all three species (D. radiodurans, D. aerius and D. aetherius) exhibited high survival rates
(86.8 %, 80.1 % and 86.9 %, respectively). The calculated D10 values and survival rates after
one-year exposure to vacuum are listed in Table 4. Clearly, the survival rate of Deinococcus
spp. after 1 year under vacuurn(10_1 Pa) was high, and approximately 1 % to 10 % cells are
expected to survive after 1 year.
UV Radiations
We next examined the effect of solar UV radiation on deinococcal cell aggregates of
different thicknesses to determine whether the size of the cell aggregate inﬂuences the cell
survivability. The spectral ranges of UV in the interplanetary space and LEO are different
from those on the ground. In the Tanpopo mission, the MgFZ 0r SiOZ windows will cut off

by VUV172 nm doses higher than 288 kJ/mz, 12.2 kJ/m2 and 73.3 kJ/mz, respectively.
Similarly, monolayers of D. radiodurans, D. aerius and D. aetherius cells were killed by
VUV254 nm doses higher than 8.6 kJ/mz, 1.7 kJ/m2 and 11.1 kJ/mz, respectively. The survival
rate, however, increased with the increased thickness of cells (Figs. 6 and 7). Though some

intensity of UV radiation.

We deﬁned T10 as the thickness that enables 10 % survival of cells following one-year
exposure to VUV172nm and UVC254 nm. Table 5 summarizes the survival rates of cells in
aggregates of various thicknesses (1, 10, 30, 50, 100, 200 and 500 um) after exposure to
VUV172 nm for 1 year. The dose of VUV on 188 orbit was estimated to be 0.12 J/(mzs) for
120 nm to 200 nm radiation (Lean 1991). Thus, the total dose after a year of exposure to
VUV172 nm was 3.8><103 kJ/mz. The calculated T10 values for D. radiodurans, D. aerius and
D. aetherius under 3.8><103 kJ/ni2 0f VUV172 nm exposure were found to be 6 pm, 39 um
and 17 pm, respectively. Table 5 also summarizes the survival rates of cells in aggregates of
various thicknesses (1, 50, 100, 200, 500, 1,000 and 2,000 um) after exposure to VUV254 nm
irradiation for 1 year. The dose of UVC on 188 orbit was estimated to be 5.89 J/(mzs) for
200 nm to 280 nm radiation (Lean 1991). Thus, the total dose after a year of exposure to
UVC254 nm was 1.9><105 kJ/mz. The calculated T10 values for D. radiodurans, D. aerius and
D. aetherius under 1.9><105 kJ/ni2 0f UVC254 nm exposure were found to be 46 pm, 413 um
and 327 pm, respectively. The order of resistance of Deinococcus spp. against VUV172nm
and UVC254 nm was D. radiodurans, D. aetherius, and then D. aerius. In addition, UVC254 nm
was found to be more lethal than VUV172 nm for the Deinococcus spp. However, it
should be noted that the surrounding environment of solar panels with varying
positions, other 188 structure shads the UV radiation. The dose of UV radiation will
be less than the dose of our estimated dose of UV radiation.

Survivability 0f Deinococcus spp. Against the Effects of Multiple Environmental Factors
In space, harsh environmental factors have damaging effects on microbes, including their
DNA, membrane lipids and proteins. We determined the survival rates of Deinococcus spp.
following one-year exposure to multiple environmental factors including heavy ions, vacu-
um (10_1 Pa), y ray, temperature cycles (i80 oC/90 min cycle and i60 oC/90 min cycle), and
VUV172 nm and UVC254 nm radiation. Survivability 0f Deinococcus spp. against the effects
of multiple environmental factors was calculated by multiplying the survival rates after one-
year exposure of heavy-ions, y ray, temperature cycles, vacuum and UV radiation. Results
are summarized in Table 6. The survival rates after one-year of exposure to y ray for all

Discussion
In this study, we evaluated the Viability of species (D. radiodurans, D. aerius and D. aetherius)
after exposure to harsh environmental conditions for a year in the Tanpopo mission. It has been
reported earlier that D. radiodurans can not only tolerate high dose of y ray radiation,
but they are also extremely tolerant to other extreme environmental factors (Battista 1997;
Blasius et al. 2008; Slade and Radman 2011). D. aerius and D. aetherius, which were isolated
from high altitude environment in J apan, also exhibited high resistance to y and UV radiations
(Yang et al. 2009a, 2010).
Effects of Heavy-ion Beam on Deinococcus spp.
The radiation in space mainly consists of two types of radiations: galactic radiation (GCR)
and the solar cosmic radiation (SCR) (Hellweg and Baumstark-Khan 2007). The GCR
originates in space beyond our Solar system, and it consists of 98 % baryon component
and 2 % lepton component. The baryon component is composed of 87 % proton, 12 %
helium ion beams (0c particles), and the remaining 1 % is heavy ions. The SCR component
consists of low energy solar wind particles that constantly ﬂow out of the Sun, and the so-called
highly energetic solar particle events, which originate from the magnetically disturbed regions
of the Sun, which sporadically emits bursts of energetic charged particles (Wilson et al. 1999).
They are predominantly composed of protons with a minor contribution from helium ions
(~10 %) and even smaller portions of heavy ions and electrons (1 %).

Effects of heavy-ions on D. radiodurans have been studied before (Dewey 1969;
Zirnmermann et al. 1994; Kobayashi et al. 1995). The dried cells of D. radiodurans exhibited
high resistance against exposure to particles of He, C, Ne, Ar and Ni (Kobayashi et al. 1995). In
the interplanetary space, annual dose rate of cosmic ionizing radiation is less than 0.1 Gy/year

(Nicholson et al. 2000). In this study, we estimated D10 and survival rate of deinococcal species
after 1 Gy exposure (Table 2). The dose of He and Ar ion will not affect the survival of
Deinococcus spp. after one-year exposure

Generally, damages induced by ionizing radiation in microbes are various types of DNA
damage including double-strand breaks (DSBs), single—strand breaks (SSB s), base modiﬁcation
(AP site), and sugar modiﬁcation (Zimmermann et al. 1994; Goodhead 1994). DSBs
are the most lethal form of DNA damage. It has been shown that D. radiodurans can
repair over 100 DSBs in chromosomes during post—irradiation incubation (Dean et al. 1966;
Narumi 2003).

D. aetherius has been reported to be more resistant against y ray (D10 : 8 kGy) than the
D. radiodurans (D10 : 6.7 kGy) (Yang et al. 2010). In contrast, D. aerius has exhibited lower
resistance against y ray (D10 : 4.9 kGy) than D. radiodurans (Yang et al. 2009a). The order
of resistance to y ray radiation for the three species was similar to the order of resistance
against heavy-ion beam. Interestingly, D. aetherius showed higher tolerance to heavy ions
than D. radiodurans and D. aerius (Table 2). These results implied that D. aethterius might
have better ability to repair DSBs than D. radiodurans.

Effects of Temperature Cycle on Deinococcus spp.

The temperature of a body in space, which is determined by absorption and emission of
energy, depends on its position with respect to the Sun and other orbiting bodies, and
also on its surface, size, mass, and albedo (Nicholson et al. 2000; Mileikowsky et al. 2000;
Horneck et al. 2002).

A previous study has shown that a 10 min of exposure to 60 0C or 80 oC had no effect on
the survival of dried D. radiodurans cells (Bauermeister et al. 2012). These results suggested
that the cells could withstand exposure to high temperature (<80 0C) for a short time
(Bauermeister et al. 2012). Determining the tolerance of other Deinococcus spp. to changes
in temperature cycle is, however, important. In this study, the temperature change tolerance
of three Deinococcus spp. was examined. Whereas the i80 oC temperature cycle severely
impaired the survival of Deinococcus spp., the effect was less severe for the i60 oC
temperature cycle (Fig. 4 and Table 3).

The temperature of EXPOSE-E on 188 was reported to ﬂuctuate between 20 oC and
59 oC (Horneck et al. 2012; Rabbow et al. 2012). It is possible that we might have used an
overestimated condition in our model for the simulated temperature cycles. If i60 oC
temperature cycles were used during the space experiment, then all the deinococcal species
would have survived after 1 year.

Effects of Vacuum on Deinococcus spp.

Dehydration causes severe damage to the cell components—lipid membranes may change
from planar bilayers to cylindrical bilayers, and carbohydrates, proteins, and nucleic acids
may undergo amino-carbonyl reactions that would result in cross-linking, which would
eventually lead to polymerization of biomolecules (Dose et al. 1991; Cox 1993). Based on
the results of the effects of vacuum on deinococcal species (Fig. 5 and Table. 4), it is clear
the 1 to 10 % of the cells would survive following 1 year exposure to 10—1 Pa vacuum. It has
been suggested that the extreme resistance of Deinococci to radiation is a consequence of an
adaptation to prolonged desiccation (Mattimore and Battista 1996). Consistent with this
notion, D. radiodurans, D. aerius and D. aetherius cells were shown to survive under
desiccated condition (Yang et al. 2009b, c; Mattimore and Battista 1996). The observed

resistance of Deinococcus spp. against vacuum may be also related to the resistance against
desiccation.

Effect of UV Irradiation on Deinococcus spp.

The solar UV wavelengths range from ~10 nm to 400 nm. This entire wavelength range is
further classiﬁed into UVC (200—280 nm), UVB (280—315 nm), and UVA (315—400 nm).
Vacuum UV (VUV) (< 200 nm) can be referred to the UV ﬂux found in the interplanetary
space at wavelengths shorter than UVC (Nicholson et al. 2005). From our results, the
absorption coefﬁcients 0: (”m_l) were different as shown in table 1. The absorption
coefﬁcient of D. radiodurans was the highest among the three. The absorption at UV region
of D. radiodurans may be higher than the other two strains.

Results of the space exposure experiments suggest that among all the space enVironmen-
tal factors, solar UV is most lethal to microbes, and this UV correlated with the absorption
wavelength of DNA (Homeck 1993). The DNA directly absorbs the light around UVC
(Homeck et al. 1995). However, when shielded against the inﬂux of solar UV, spores of B.
subtilis survived in space enVironment (Homeck et al. 1994). Bacillus spores with clay, soils
and glucose as a ‘mixed layers’ and ‘artiﬁcial meteorites’ survived for prolonged period in
space (Homeck et al. 2001). Determining the tolerance of other Deinococuus spp. to changes
in temperature cycle is, however, important. It was found that when microbes were covered
with a 1—10 cm thick layer of limonite, they were protected from the solar UV radiation
(Silverman et al. 1964; Green et al. 1971; Hagen et al. 1970; de la Vega et al. 2007). Osman
et al. (2008) also observed signiﬁcant survival of spore-forming bacteria isolated from the
Atacama Desert from full spectrum Martian UV (200—400 nm) irradiation when shielded by
micro soil particles (<60 pm).

The deinococcal isolates from the high atmosphere tended to form cell clumps or
aggregates, which was considered to help their survival under UV irradiating environment
(Yang et al. 2009c). We have proposed that multi-layered (i.e., aggregated) deinococcal cells
may survive in space for a long time (Yamagishi et al. 2008). Consistent with this proposal,
we have demonstrated here that D. radiodurans, D. aerius and D. aetherius cells survived
after exposure to VUV172 nm and UVC254 nm radiation. Though cells in thin layers or
aggregates were killed by UV radiation, large numbers of cells survived the radiation when
the cell layer was thick (Figs. 6 and 7). Results of our study suggest that cells near the
surface layer were killed by UV, and the layers of killed cells protected the cells underneath
from the UV damage. Supposing that the aggregated cells are sphere, the diameter of the cell
aggregate that could shield the cells in the inner layer from solar UV radiation is over
200 pm for D. radiodurans, 850 pm for D. aerius, and 700 pm for D. aetherius.

The tolerance of D. radiodurans against UV radiation of shorter wavelength than VUV
has also been reported. Thus, when layers of various thicknesses of D. radiodurans cells
were exposed to synchrotron light (A=121.6 nm), multi-layered cells (7 pm thick) showed
higher survival rate than the monolayer cells (Paulino-Lima et al. 2010). Consistent with this
observation, we found high survivability of D. radiodurans cells in micrometer-sized
aggregates after exposure to VUV172 nm radiation (Fig. 6).

microbes for the Tanpopo mission. In the present study, we have investigated the effects of
heavy-ions, y ray, temperature cycles, vacuum and UV radiation on the survivability of
Deinococcus spp. In the Tanpopo mission exposure device, cells that are present deep inside
the cell aggregates of few hundred micrometer thickness were shielded from the radiations of
VUV172 nm and UVC254 nm. Thus, if deinococcal cells are embedded in the 2-mm—deep wells of
the aluminum plates (Fig. 2), D. radiodurans and D. aetherius will survive after exposure
experiment for 1 year in the Tanpopo mission (Table 6). Here, the survivability of Deinococcus
spp. after 1 year in space was estimated by multiplying the survival rates after one-year
exposure of heavy-ions, y ray, temperature cycles, vacuum and UV radiation. D. aerius cells
will be killed when the temperature ﬂuctuation is i80 0C, but they would survive if the
temperature ﬂuctuation is less than i60 oC. Based on our results, we conclude that Deinococcus
spp. could be suitable candidate microbes for exposure experiments.

Microbial Cell-Aggregates as a Form for Interplanetary Transfer of Microbes
Lithopanspermia hypothesis proposes the interplanetary transfer of microbes inside of rocks
(reviewed in Nicholson 2009; Horneck et al. 2002, 2010). A few micrometer size of
meteorite, which does not have any crack, would be good enough to provide protection
against UV radiation (Mileikowsky et al. 2000).

Our results suggest that the aggregated cells of D. radiodurans, D. aerius and D. aetherius
are highly resistant to environments of LEO. We would like to emphasize the possible
importance of microbial cell-aggregates as an ark for interplanetary transfer of microbes. We
call this concept ‘massapanspermia’ (‘Massa’ stands for mass in Latin). The proposed
experiment for the Tanpopo mission is intended to test the possibility that this
massapanspermia concept might be true. Aggregated cells of D. radiodurans, D. aerius and
D. aetherius will be prepared to various thicknesses—from l um (monolayer) to 2,000 um.
After the exposure experiments, we will analyze the Viability of Deinococcus spp. to answer
whether the aggregated cells would survive the interplanetary journey.
