Abstract: As a demonstrator for technologies for the next generation of ocean color sensors,
the Hyperspectral Imager for the Coastal Ocean (HICO) provides enhanced spatial and
spectral resolution that is required to understand optically complex aquatic environments. In
this study we apply HICO, along with satellite remote sensing and in situ observations, to
studies of phytoplankton ecology in a dynamic coastal upwelling environment—Monterey
Bay, CA, USA. From a spring 2011 study, we examine HICO-detected spatial patterns in
phytoplankton optical properties along an environmental gradient defined by upwelling
ﬂow patterns and along a temporal gradient of upwelling intensification. From a fall 2011
study, we use HICO’s enhanced spatial and spectral resolution to distinguish a small-scale
“red tide” bloom, and we examine bloom expansion and its supporting processes using
other remote sensing and in situ data. From a spectacular HICO image of the Monterey
Bay region acquired during fall of 2012, we present a suite of algorithm results for
Characterization of phytoplankton, and we examine the strengths, limitations, and
distinctions of each algorithm in the context of the enhanced spatial and spectral resolution.

1. Introduction

The Hyperspeetral Imager for the Coastal Ocean (HICO) is the ﬁrst spaceborne imaging
spectrometer designed for coastal ocean research [1,2]. Sponsored by the Ofﬁce of Naval Research as
an Innovative Naval Prototype, HICO was developed to demonstrate improved coastal remote sensing
products including bathymetry, bottom types, water optical properties, and on-shore vegetation maps.
Enhanced products are supported by HICO’s spatial resolution (<100 X 100 m), spectral resolution
(400 to 900 nm sampled at 5.7 nm) and signal-to-noise ratio (>200:1 for a 5% albedo scene). Based on
the Portable Hyperspectral Imager for Low-Light Spectroscopy (PHILLS) airborne imaging
spectrometers [3], HICO demonstrates innovative ways to reduce the cost and schedule of a space
mission, by adapting proven aircraft imager architecture and using commercial off-the-shelf
components. HICO was installed on the International Space Station (188) on 23 September 2009 and
collected its ﬁrst images the following day. HICO observations have since been targeted for a wide
variety of environments. Here we focus on the application of HICO capabilities to the measurement of
water optical properties and characterization of phytoplankton in a highly productive coastal system.

The study region, Monterey Bay, California (Figure 1) is the largest open embayment along the
west coast of the USA. It is located in the central California Current System (CCS). Wind driven
upwelling 0f nutrient-rich deep water in coastal upwelling systems like the CCS supports high levels of
primary productivity [4]. Most of the wind-driven upwelling supply to Monterey Bay originates from
upwelling centers north and south of the bay [5,6]. These upwelling centers are shown in Figure 1 as
the regions where cold upwelling plumes emanate from the coast: Point Aﬁo NueVO and Point Sur.
Additionally, upwelling within the bay occurs in response to strong diurnal forcing by the sea
breeze [7], and in response to internal oscillations over Monterey Canyon that transport deep water
onto the shelf [8,9]. In addition to supporting great ﬁsheries, coastal upwelling systems host a variety
of harmful algal bloom (HAB) types [10]. In Monterey Bay, blooming 0f toxigenic diatoms has been
directly linked to wind-driven upwelling [11], and blooming of a dinoﬂagellate species that can cause
massive mortality of seabirds [12] has been linked to canyon upwelling [9]. Additionally,
anthropogenic nutrient sources regulate toxicity of HAB diatoms [13] as well as bloom dynamics of a
dinoﬂagellate species linked to seabird mortality [14].

The diversity and variability of natural and anthropogenic forcing in the Monterey Bay region
creates tremendous ecological complexity. This complexity motivates advancement of methods. In this
study, we show how the enhanced spatial and spectral resolution of HICO supports methods to
advance understanding of this complex environment. Using studies during the contrasting seasons of
spring and fall, we illustrate processes of phytoplankton ecology by integrating algorithm results
derived from HICO data with multidisciplinary satellite remote sensing and in situ observations.

2. Materials and Methods

2.]. HICO Image Acquisition and Processing

HICO is a demonstration sensor, and data are collected for particular study areas from a target list
compiled by Naval Research Laboratory (NRL) personnel with input from Navy, academic, and
international partners. The standard HICO scene is 42 X 192 km, and a maximum of one scene is
collected on each 90-min orbit. Data requests are compiled by NRL and sent by NASA to the 18$ for
execution. Data is transmitted from the 188 to NASA Marshall Space Flight Center and then to NRL in
Washington DC for processing. The initial processing from level 0 (raw data) to level 1b (calibrated
radiances with geolocation information) includes dark current subtraction, CCD smear correction,
second-order correction, spectral calibration, and radiance calibration. We requested data collections
for Monterey Bay and obtained the HICO data from Oregon State University [15].

For atmospheric correction (AC) of HICO images we used two software implementations, the
ATmosphere REMoval (ATREM) algorithm [16], and Taﬂ<aa 6s [17]. The purpose of applying multiple
AC implementations was to evaluate (1) the quality and sensitivity of AC results relative to in situ
optical measurements, and (2) results from phytoplankton characterization algorithms that employ
different regions of the spectrum (Section 2.2). Limitations in HICO radiometric calibration required
modiﬁcation of the application of ATREM. A Rayleigh scattering correction was applied based on solar
and Viewing geometry to obtain the Rayleigh-corrected intermediate reﬂectance spectrum. The mean
value of intermediate reﬂectance for eight narrow channels near 760 nm was calculated. This mean value
was subtracted from the intermediate reﬂectance spectrum for all channels to retrieve water-leaving
reﬂectance. This method effectively removed effects of sun glint, thin clouds and fog, and the spectrally
independent portion of aerosol effects (such as those from large oceanic particles). In addition to this

"
"4","Remote Sens. 2014, 6 1010
modiﬁed Rayleigh computation, ATREM also computed atmospheric gas absorption. Based on
ATREM, Taﬂ<aa was similarly conﬁgured to correct for solar- and Viewing-geometry-dependent
Rayleigh scattering and atmospheric gas absorption. For comparison with in situ spectra acquired
during the fall 2011 study, we also examined spectra from a 26 October HICO image processed using
standard NASA ocean color algorithms for the MODIS channels derived from the HICO spectra. This
image was acquired from the NASA ocean color website.

Atmospherically corrected HICO images of Monterey Bay contained a cross-track offset that
depended on wavelength as well as solar and Viewing geometry. For bands above 550 nm, this offset
was small, less than 1% of normalized water leaving radiance (an), but between 550 and 400 nm the
offset increased monotonically. The additional signal in the blue is thought to be a polarization dependent
artifact speciﬁc to the HICO sensor [18]. We corrected for the cross-track artifact using an empirical
procedure that computes a wavelength dependent quadratic function from cloud-free cross-track scans and
applies the correction to all cross-track scans. For geolocation 0f HICO image pixels, we used the
geometry data provided with each image as well as ground control points. This procedure located
pixels to within 2—3 pixels (a few hundred meters).

2.2. Algorithmsfor Phytoplankton Characterization

We employed a suite of algorithms for characterization of phytoplankton from remote sensing of
ocean color, using single 5.7 nm HICO bands whose center wavelengths were closest to those used
with multispectral data (Table 1). The longest standing characterization is the band-ratio chlorophyll
algorithm that uses the blue-green region of the spectrum. Speciﬁcally, we used the 0C4 chlorophyll
algorithm [19]. To quantify inherent optical properties (IOPs), we used a quasi-analytieal
algorithm [20,21], specifically Version 5 [22]. IOP computations used a reference wavelength of
555 nm. The chlorophyll and IOP calculations used remote sensing reﬂectance resulting from ATREM,
followed by cross-track illumination correction (Section 2.1). Additionally we examined results from a
suite of linear baseline algorithms that employ the red to near—infrared region of the spectrum. These were
chlorophyll ﬂuorescence line height (FLH) computed using bands corresponding to both the MODIS and
MERIS multispectral sensors and the maximum chlorophyll index (MCI) used to detect intense “red tide”
blooms by their reﬂectance peak in the near—infrared [23,24]. For all linear baseline results, we used an
resulting from Taﬂ<aa, followed by cross-track illumination correction (Section 2.1).

2.3. Satellite Observations

To extend characterization of the ecology of a nascent “extreme bloom” detected by HICO, we used
MERIS MCI (Section 2.2). These images were computed from MERIS Level 2 radiance data using the
ESA BEAM software. To examine regional sea surface temperature (SST) patterns, we used data from

"
"5","Remote Sens. 2014, 6 1011
the Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer (AVHRR) constellation of sensors. The AVHRR
processing methods applied in this study are documented elsewhere [25].

2.4. In Situ Observations

Observations from the M1 mooring at the mouth of Monterey Bay (Figure 1) were used for study
context, as well as direct comparison with HICO results. Speciﬁcally, we used measurements of
surface wind speed and direction, water column temperature and salinity, and near-surface (1 m)
chlorophyll ﬂuorescence. Details of M1 sensors are documented elsewhere [11]. Hourly data were
daily-averaged. During the spring 2011 study, we used high-resolution multidisciplinary water column
observations acquired by the Dorado autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV). Details of Dorado and
its sensing suite are available in earlier publications [9,26]. During our fall 2011 study, in situ
hyperspectral optical ground truth measurements were made using a Satlantic HyperPro II proﬁling
radiometer. Vertical profiles were binned to 10 cm resolution and propagated to the surface using the
ProSoft software standard processing. Remote sensing reﬂectance was determined using the surface
reference sensor and the propagated an values from the proﬁle.

3. Results and Discussion
3.]. Environmental Overviewfor 20] 1

Wind forcing and oceanic response during 2011 at mooring M1 (Figure 1) provide context for the
spring and fall studies (Figure 2). Upwelling favorable (alongshore, equatorward) winds were most
persistently directed and strongest during April—May. The oceanic response to this wind forcing is
evident as the minimum temperatures and maximum salinities in the upper water column, also during
April and May (Figure 2). These relatively cold and saline conditions reﬂect the presence of deep
water upwelled to the surface (Figure 1). Our spring study took place during this period of maximum
upwelling. Progressing through the summer and into the fall, average wind speed decreased, wind
direction became more variable, and the warmest surface conditions of the year developed during
October (Figure 2). Our fall study took place during this warm period.

3.2. Spring 20]] Study

During the spring study, three HICO images were acquired within an eight-day period (times shown
in Figure 2). During this period, 25 April to 3 May, wind forcing transitioned from a brief
relaxation/reversal to the strongest upwelling-favorable winds of the year (Figure 2). The regional
response to upwelling intensiﬁcation was likewise strong, as evidenced in water column temperature
and salinity at M1 (Figure 2) and regional SST (Figure 3). Flow from the upwelling centers north and
south of the bay generated strong cooling throughout the region, and much upwelled water entered the
bay, primarily from the Point Aﬁo Nuevo upwelling center to the north (Figure 3).

Mooring M1 was in the path of this upwelling ﬂow (Figure 3), and its sensors detected not only the
cooling, but also a decline in chlorophyll ﬂuorescence (Figure 4). Variation in chlorophyll ﬂuorescence
at M1 occurred at two dominant time scales. One time scale was that of the transition to from relatively
warm, high-chlorophyll conditions during 24—28 April to relatively cool, low-chlorophyll conditions

"
"6","Remote Sens. 2014, 6 1012
after 28 April. This was associated with inﬂux of recently upwelled water (Figure 3), which is typically
low in phytoplankton abundance. The second time scale was approximately diurnal (Figure 4). While
diurnal variation in chlorophyll ﬂuorescence may have a physiological basis, this bio-optical variation
coincided with similar diurnal variation in temperature during much of the record. This suggests that
variation at this time scale was associated primarily with a physical process having a quasi-diurnal
frequency, such as advection of gradients. This is supported by the synoptic patterns of chlorophyll
ﬂuorescence line height (FLH) in the HICO images, particularly those for 25 and 27 April (Figure 4b,c).
M1 was amid strong horizontal gradients in FLH, thus periodic currents caused by tidal and/or diurnal
wind forcing would have cyclically advected local gradients and caused the oscillatory signal at M1.

Chlorophyll FLH (w m‘2 11m“ sr“)

While the ﬁxed-point time series at M1 suggests a simple response of decreasing chlorophyll
ﬂuorescence in association with the upwelling event, the HICO spring time-series reveals great
patchiness developing throughout the region (Figure 4). Regions of relatively high FLH moved both
offshore and into the central bay between 25 and 27 April (Figure 4b,c), consistent with the bifurcated
ﬂow that typically develops when upwelled water that originates north of the bay ﬂows across the bay
mouth [6]. The generally lower FLH that prevailed by 3 May (Figure 4d) is consistent with the
inﬂuence of strong wind stress causing enhanced turbulent vertical mixing of the upper water column
and associated decreases in phytoplankton concentrations near the surface. The early onset of this
upwelling event was closely monitored by AUV surveys (Figure 5).

The arrival of recently upwelled water is illustrated by the cooling of the upper water column by ~1.5 °C
(Figure 5, left column). Corresponding with the arrival of cold recently upwelled water was a decrease
in ﬂuorometric chlorophyll concentrations and optical backscattering (Figure 5, middle two columns).
Interpreted as a proxy for the concentration of particulate matter, optical backscattering data indicate a
signiﬁcant decrease in particle concentrations within the northern bay during the upwelling response.
Using the ratio of optical backscattering t0 chlorophyll ﬂuorescence (right column), we can distinguish
particle types. The exceptionally high values of this ratio observed at the offshore end of the last

survey (Figure 5, lower right panel) were associated with suspended sediments that were transported
with the upwelled water. An enhanced color HICO image from 27 April shows a whitish sediment
plume originating from the coast north of the bay (not presented). Considering the potential transport of
trace metals with sediments, this process has signiﬁcant implications not only for phytoplankton
productivity [27,28], but also for toxicity of toxigenic diatoms—as indicated by laboratory studies [29—3 1]
and suggested from ﬁeld studies [11,32].

The ﬁrst HICO image of the spring series, on 25 April, was acquired following a brief (~3 day)
wind relaxation that followed weeks of strong and persistent upwelling (Figure 2). Warming and
freshening 0f the upper water column occurred during the wind relaxation (Figure 2). This change in
the physical environment is characteristic of wind relaxations [9,32] and consistent with the
development of relatively quiescent conditions and a more stably stratiﬁed water column, with
implications for response of the phytoplankton community to the preceding upwelling and associated
nutrient supply. We examine physical and bio-optical patterns for this time to consider patchiness in
phytoplankton bio-optical signal derived from HICO.

SST 011 25 April showed a patchy remnant signature of the upwelling that preceded wind relaxation
(Figure 3a). This relatively cool water extended across the mouth of Monterey Bay and within two
lobes in the northern and southern bay. While evident in the color scaling of the SST time series
(Figure 3), we more clearly illustrate this environmental structure in Figure 6a, for comparison with
bio-optical characterizations.

Chlorophyll FLH observed by HICO one hour after this SST image exhibited similar structure, with
elevated FLH extending across the bay mouth and within two lobes extending into the northern and
southern bay (Figure 4b). Chlorophyll concentration estimates from HICO also show this structure
(Figure 6b). The FLH t0 chlorophyll ratio (F/C) revealed distinct patches (numbered in Figure 6c). F/C
was much higher in the southern bay lobe (Figure 6c, #2) than in the northern bay lobe (Figure 6c, #1),
corresponding with c001er water in the southern bay (Figure 6a). The relatively cool temperature in the
southern bay suggests relatively greater nutrient input during the preceding upwelling period. Further,
F/C was yet higher in a patch observed immediately outside of Monterey Bay (Figure 6c, #3). Nutrient
supply to this area was evidently derived from both upwelling centers (Figure 6a), and upwelling
ﬁlaments from both centers are known to merge in this region during strong upwelling (e.g., Figure 1).
Thus, the combined physical and bi0-0ptical patterns are consistent with different physiological
responses of the phytoplankton along an environmental gradient of increasing nutrient supply,
speciﬁcally greater quantum yield of ﬂuorescence in regions of greater nutrient input [23,33]. It is also
possible that the patchiness in F/C was due to similarly structured patchiness in phytoplankton
communities [34], which in turn had different optical properties and physiology (absorption, scattering,
quantum yield of ﬂuorescence).

3.3. Fall2011 Study

The fall study coincided with the warmest water conditions of the year (Figure 2). A clear HICO
image acquired on 26 October (time shown in Figure 2) supported examination of phytoplankton
ec0types (Figure 7).

"
"10","Remote Sens. 2014, 6 1016

Chlorophyll and FLH exhibited similar patterns, however distinct patches were evident. One patch
was in the northern bay, where a narrow ﬁlament extending from the coastal boundary exhibited
elevated FLH (arrow in Figure 7b), compared to chlorophyll (Figure 7a). Applying the MCI algorithm
to the HICO data further revealed distinction of this patch, which exhibited elevated reﬂectance in the
near-infrared. This signal indicates dense accumulations of phytoplankton near the surface [24]. Such
dense “red tide” patches are most commonly observed during the warm, stratiﬁed fall season in this
region of the bay [9,32,35—37], and they have been linked to HAB effects [12]. Although at coarser
spatial resolution, the MERIS satellite sensor also detected this distinct bloom patch in northern
Monterey Bay on 26 October (Figure 8a). Further, a time-series from MERIS revealed that this bloom
increased in intensity and spatial scale during the following week (Figure 8a—d). MERIS coverage of
the entire bay conﬁrmed that throughout its expansion this distinct bloom remained within the domain
shown in Figure 8. In situ optical measurements for ground-truth 0f the remote sensing data were
acquired on 28 October (Figure 9), at the location shown in Figure 8b (white +), less than one hour
after the MERIS image was acquired.

Patchiness at a scale ﬁner than that resolved by the MERIS image may have inﬂuenced the in situ
optical measurements. However, the location of in situ sensing relative to the bloom distribution
evident in the MERIS image indicates that the in situ measurements were made in an area where MCI
values were comparable to the maximum observed on 26 October (cf. Figures 8a,b). Thus, we compare
the in situ data from 28 October to the HICO spectra from 26 October for the red tide patch (Figure 7),
assuming that each represents signal of enhanced reﬂectance in the near-infrared from the same bloom
type. This comparison (Figure 9) shows similar spectral shapes at wavelengths greater than ~ 570 nm,
and divergence of spectral shapes at shorter wavelengths for different atmospheric correction methods.
The similar spectral shape in both in situ and atmospherically corrected HICO data across the
reﬂectance peak centered near 700 nm, 1.6., the optical signal of the bloom, supports application of this
spectral shape algorithm to describing the bloom.

To investigate the processes underlying expansion of this distinct bloom type (Figure 8), we
examine regional SST patterns during the same period (Figure 10). In each image, the domain of the
bloom patch is overlaid (as indicated by the arrows in Figure 10).

Activity of the upwelling centers north and south of the bay increased during this period, and
cooling occurred throughout the region. This was associated with the return of upwelling favorable
winds following a minimum in wind speed 011 26 October (Figure 2). On 26 October, the small bloom

from the coast south of Monterey Bay, northward across the mouth of the bay (Figure 10a). This
ﬁlament was detected at mooring M1 the previous day (sudden cooling before the image acquisition time
indicated in Figure 2). In addition to local cooling of 3 CC, nitrate concentrations at the surface increased
by ~50M (data Viewable at http://www.mbari.org/lobo/lobovizhtm), conﬁrming the potential of this
water to enrich nutrient supply to phytoplankton. As upwelling increased, the nutrient-enriehed cold
ﬁlament was transported into the nearshore environment of the bloom patch (Figure 10b). By
1 November, the expanding bloom was observed within a more distinct frontal zone between the warm
resident bay waters and the intruding 0001 waters (Figure 100). The intrusion was apparently linked to
a cyclonic ﬂow within the bay, as indicated by the adjacent cool/warm anomalies (Figure 10b, 0).

3.4. Examination ofAlgorithmsfor Characterization ofPhytoplankton
Examination of algorithms for characterization of phytoplankton from HICO data is best supported
by images that contain signals from a range of eeotypes. The fall 2011 study included a small
“red tide” bloom that was optically distinguishable (previous section). However, an image from
6 November 2012 contained much greater signal range, and we use this image to examine the strengths
and limitations of different algorithms (Figure 11). The pseudo true-color HICO image indicates great
patchiness and suggests different phytoplankton eeotypes across the range of blue, green and brown
water color (Figure 11a). Although a light atmospheric haze is evident in the image, a swath of brown
across the northern bay stands out. Results of both band-ratio chlorophyll and IOP algorithms
distinguish this brown water, which contained the highest values of both parameters (Figure 11b,e;
a¢444 is phytoplankton absorption at 444 nm). This dense bloom is further distinguished by
identiﬁcation of the wavelength at which the reﬂectance spectrum peaked in the red to near-infrared

range (Figure 11d). Extending well beyond the chlorophyll ﬂuorescence peak wavelength (~683 11m),
this patch exhibited spectral peaks at wavelengths up to 708 nm, characteristic of intense “red tide”
blooms [24] previously observed in this region With satellite and airborne remote sensing [36,37].

Next we examine a series of results from the linear baseline algorithms (LBAs), also known as
spectral shape algorithms [38]. N0 distinction of the intense bloom patch (Figure 11a—d) is evident in

"

FLH computed using MODIS FLH bands (Figure 11e). Similar FLH levels are indicated in the intense
bloom as in a large phytoplankton patch north of the bay, which exhibited much lower chlorophyll and
a¢444 (Figure 11b,c). The reason for this lack of distinction is illustrated in Figure 12a. The shift of the
reﬂectance peak into the near-infrared, caused by the extremely high concentration of phytoplankton
near the surface, placed the bloom signal to the long wavelength side of center wavelength used by the
MODIS FLH algorithm. The spectral peak shift was more moderate in the bloom patch observed on 26
October 2011 (Figure 9), thus placing the peak closer to the FLH algorithm center wavelength and
yielding greater distinction of the patch in FLH (Figure 7b).

The intense bloom patch of 6 November 2012 was distinguished in FLH computed using MERIS
bands (Figure 111), however the algorithm quantiﬁes it as the largest negative anomaly within the
image. The reason for this inversion of bloom optical signal is illustrated in Figure 12b. The shift of
the reﬂectance peak into the near-infrared lifts the long-wavelength end of the baseline, thus placing
reﬂectance at the center wavelength of the MERIS FLH algorithm below the baseline. Such negative
spectral shape has been used to detect cynobacterial blooms in the Laurentian Great Lakes with both
MERIS and MODIS data [38,39]. The intense bloom patch is effectively isolated by the MCI
algorithm (Figure 11g), which was specifically designed to quantify strong near-infrared reﬂectance
from this bloom type (Figure 12c). However, one consequence of isolating this spectral feature with
this method is computation of the lowest MCI values in waters that have moderately high FLH
(Figure 11e—g). This is because the MCI center wavelength falls in a trough of a spectrum characterized
by ordinary chlorophyll ﬂuorescence. Spatial patterns of intense bloom signal in MCI (Figure 11g)
chlorophyll (Figure 11b) and a¢444 (Figure 11c) are distinct, suggesting considerable patchiness of
phytoplankton community composition and/or physiological state within the bloom patch.

spectrum from the 6 November 2012 HICO image (Figure 11). The spectrum is an average

Each LBA was designed for a speciﬁc purpose using data from multispectral sensing. None was
designed for hyperspectral sensing, and none consistently characterize spatial patterns of

Accurate description of variation in the spectral shape and intensity of phytoplankton reﬂectance
requires algorithms that adapt their ﬁanction according to the attributes of the reﬂectance spectrum itself.
The maximum peak—height (MPH) is one such algorithm designed for MERIS multispectral data [40].
It was developed for operational determination of trophic status and indication of potentially harmful
phytoplankton blooms in coastal and inland systems. MPH uses a baseline subtraction procedure, as in the
FLH algorithm. While the short wavelength end of the baseline for MPH is the same as that used for
MERIS FLH (665 nm), the long wavelength end is greater than that used for FLH (885 nm versus 709 nm).
This is to enable quantiﬁcation of signal caused by exceptionally dense cyanobacterial blooms. MPH
computes the height of the dominant peak Within the wavelength range of the baseline, at band-center
wavelengths of 681, 709 or 753 nm, as caused by the balance of sun-induced chlorophyll ﬂuorescence
and particulate backscatter.

To more effectively localize the reﬂectance peak caused by phytoplankton in the 6 November 2012
HICO image, and to more consistently quantify phytoplankton optical signal across the different
population types, we apply adaptation to the attributes of the reﬂectance spectrum itself in an
algorithm termed adaptive reﬂectance peak height (ARPH). We do not require the Wide baseline of
MPH and thus set baseline wavelengths to the HICO center wavelengths nearest those used for
MODIS FLH (Table 1), which take into consideration the inﬂuence of oxygen and water vapor
absorption on spectral shape [23], and Which are well-placed for characterization of optical signal from
phytoplankton populations in Monterey Bay. We also constrain more narrowly the wavelength range
for adaptive peak localization and quantification. The upper wavelength is constrained to <710 nm to
exclude kelp forest reﬂectance evident in the image While including the maximum wavelength of peak
reﬂectance in the phytoplankton red tide bloom (Figure 11d). The lower wavelength is constrained
based on the observed minimum wavelength at Which the red tide bloom exhibited distinction in its
spectral peak, 690 nm (Figure 11d). With these constraints ARPH allowed adaptive quantiﬁcation of
phytoplankton optical signal across four HICO bands centered at 690, 696, 702 and 708 nm. Outside this
range ARPH is equivalent to the MODIS FLH algorithm using HICO’s nearest spectral bands (Table 1).
Results from the ARPH algorithm illustrate effective adaptation using the spectral resolution of HICO
(Figure 11h). ARPH provides a more consistent characterization of phytoplankton optical signal than any
of the other algorithms. Like MODIS FLH, ARPH represents ordinary chlorophyll ﬂuorescence
consistently (Figure 11e,h). However, unlike MODIS FLH, ARPH distinguishes the extreme bloom patch
that is evident in chlorophyll, a¢444 and reﬂectance peak wavelength (Figure 11b—d). Further, ARPH
avoids the conﬁJsed mixture of negative and positive anomalies caused by displacement of the reﬂectance
peak within the red to near-infrared range, as described for MERIS FLH and MCI (Figure 11 f,g;
Figure 12). The principle of MPH, as applied to HICO data in ARPH, is promising.

The spatial and spectral resolution of HICO and the growing archive of HICO image data in diverse
aquatic environments Will augment the development of methods to effectively characterize
phytoplankton by remote sensing. Satellite remote sensing of freshwater cyanobacterial blooms has
effectively used data of relatively coarse spatial and spectral resolution [3 8—40]; HICO’s greater spatial
and spectral resolutions enable more effective study of the patchiness and ecology of such blooms.
Beyond the spectral analysis methods explored here are a host of algorithms designed for laboratory
spectral analysis that can now be applied to HICO images [41]. An artiﬁcial neural network approach
that analyzes ecological and geographical knowledge together With remotely sensed bio-optical and

Atlantic [42], and hyperspeetral remote sensing data may enhance the effectiveness of this approach.
Distinction 0f eoeeolithophore blooms has employed hyperspeetral remote sensing data and
differential optical absorption spectroscopy analysis [43]. Discrimination of phytoplankton pigment
assemblages in the open ocean during non-bloom conditions had employed cluster analysis of in situ
optical data, including measurements of multispeetral remote sensing reﬂectance and hyperspeetral
absorption [44]. HICO offers the opportunity to extend these analysis methods to high-resolution
remotely sensed data.
4. Conclusions

Coastal ocean environments are profoundly important to global ecology, and they are major societal
drivers through their support of living and mineral resource extraction, recreation, and tourism.
Effective management of these Vital environments requires comprehensive multidisciplinary
understanding. Remote sensing provides one of the most effective tools for understanding coastal
ecosystems and their connections to the greater ocean and land interfaces. As with any research
endeavor, the closer we look, the more we learn. With its enhanced spatial and spectral resolution,
HICO provides just such an opportunity to look more closely at the highly complex processes that
drive coastal ecology. The examples presented in this study represent a small fraction of the HICO
images of Monterey Bay, and a yet smaller fraction of the 8600 HICO images acquired worldwide.
Studies such as this provide the opportunity to explore utilization of enhanced remote sensing
resolutions, toward advancing ecological knowledge, environmental management, and design of ﬁJture
sensors. In particular the ﬁJture NASA ocean color sensors PACE, GEO-CAPE and HyspIRI are all
proposed as hyperspeetral imagers. HICO data provides an opportunity to develop new hyperspeetral
algorithms and evaluate spectral and spatial sampling and signal-tO-noise requirements for these sensors.
