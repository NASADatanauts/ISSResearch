Abstract
Background: National Aeronautical and Space and Administration (NASA) researchers have optimized
training methods that allow minimally trained, non—physician operators to obtain diagnostic ultrasound
(US) images for medical diagnosis including musculoskeletal injury. We hypothesize that these techniques
could be expanded to non-expert operators including National Hockey League (NHL) and Olympic athletic
trainers to diagnose musculoskeletal injuries in athletes.
Methods: NHL and Olympic athletic trainers received a brief course on musculoskeletal US. Remote
guidance musculoskeleta] examinations were conducted by athletic trainers, consisting of hockey groin
hernia, knee, ankle, elbow, or shoulder evaluations. US images were transmitted to remote experts for
interpretation.
Results: Groin, knee, ankle, elbow, or shoulder images were obtained on 32 athletes; all real-time US
video stream and still capture images were considered adequate for diagnostic interpretation.
Conclusions: This experience suggests that US can be expanded for use in locations without a high level
of onwsite expertise. A non—physician with minimal training can perform complex, diagnostic-quality
examinations when directed by a remote—based expert. © 2007 Excerpta Medica the. All rights reserved.
