Preliminary Experiments Using Electromagnetic Levitation
On the International Space Station

Abstract
Calibration and check-out runs during FeCrNi steel alloy melting cycles on the International Space Station are compared to previous test
results from experimental platforms both in microgravity and on ground. Four key thermophysical properties are investigated: density,
thermal expansion, surface tension and Viscosity. Analysis shows that the three facilities yield results with comparable accuracy but the space
results indicate that planned changes to on-orbit processing protocol are required to maximize the potential for signiﬁcantly improved
precision.
