: Abstract c
Emulsions are used in a wide range of applications and industries. Their size distribution is an important parameter because it inﬂuences S
‘ most of the emulsion properties of emulsions. Several techniques of characterization are used to determine the granulometric distribution 11
i of emulsions, but they are generally limited to dilute samples and are based on complex algorithms. We describe a method that allows ‘
>1 characterization of the droplet size distribution of emulsions using thermal analysis (thermogranulometry). This method permits the use of
1 very concentrated samples without any dilution 0r perturbation of the system. We ﬁrst deﬁne our method by a thermodynamic and kinetic
approach. We studied a real system, i.e., crude oil emulsions, which form very concentrated, viscous, and opaque emulsions with water. We
1 present a correlation between the size of droplets and their freezing temperature, corresponding to our system. Then we compare the size dis-
'r’j tributions obtained by our method with those derived by direct microscopy observations. The results obtained show that thermogranulometry ‘7
H . may be an interesting method of characterization of emulsions, even for concentrated systems. 1;
