Abstract

Within a 1.5 year comprehensive fading experiment several batches of LiF:Mg,Ti and
LiF:Mg,Cu,P thermoluminescence detectors (TLDs) were studied. The TLDs originated from
two manufacturers and were processed by three laboratories using different annealing and
readout conditions. The TLDs were irradiated with two radiation modalities (gamma-rays and
thermal neutrons) and were stored at two temperatures (—17.4OC and +18.50C). The goal of
the experiment was to verify the stability of TLDs in the context of their application in long-
term measurements in space.

The results revealed that the response of all TLDs is stable within 10% for the studied
temperature range. No inﬂuence of the radiation type was found. These results indicate that
for the properly oven—annealed LiF TLDs, fading is not a signiﬁcant problem, even for
measuring periods longer than a year.

1. Introduction

The response of thermoluminescent detectors (TLDs) may exhibit some changes during
their storage, both before and after irradiation (Budzanowski, Saez-Vergara et a1. 1998;
Burgkhardt and Piesch 1983; Driscoll et a1. 1985; Horowitz 1990). At each (even low)
temperature there is a probability that charge carriers escape from the trapping centres within
a TLD, resulting in the so-called “fading” of the TL signal. Also during the time between
annealing and exposure, the defect structures, acting as trapping and recombination centres,
may undergo some transformations, leading to changes of sensitivity (decrease as well as
increase). The main external factors affecting fading are temperature and time of the storage.

In case of space-borne application of TLDs, time is the main element making a difference
comparing to ground usage in the context of fading. In radiation protection applications on
Earth the typical measuring periods are up to 3 months. Longer exposure durations, in these
and other typical applications, are rare. However, in case of measurements of cosmic radiation
in Low Earth Orbit (LEO), the situation is quite different and exposure times are commonly
ranging from several months up to years. This was especially true for the MATROSHKA
(MTR) experiment (Reitz and Berger 2006; Reitz et a1. 2009) — the biggest application of
TLDs in space, consisting of the exposure of a human phantom equipped with several
thousands of TLDs inside and outside the International Space Station (188). Within this
experiment four measuring periods lasting up to 1.5 years were performed in the years 2004
to 2011 (Berger et a1. 2012). The speciﬁcity of organization of space experiments extends this
time by additional several months required between the preparation of the detectors in a

"
"4","laboratory and their delivery to the 188. The available data on performance of TLDs for such
long storage periods are in principle missing.

The temperature conditions in the 188 are not different from that encountered on Earth.
The temperature inside the station may be considered as typical room temperature (RT), up to
230C. During the MTR measurements outside the ISS temperature sensors were located inside
the phantom and the measured values ﬂuctuated between —200C and +250C.

The long duration of the measurements raised the question whether the results of the MTR
experiment were not signiﬁcantly biased by fading effects. In order to answer this question,
three of the laboratories participating in the MTR project (IFJ Krakow, DLR Cologne, ATI
Vienna) have realized an inter-comparison experiment aimed 0n the long-term studies of TLD
response stability.

2. Materials and methods

2.] TL detectors

The investigations applied the actual batches of LiF TLDs, which were previously used in
space within the MTR experiment comprising siX batches of LiF:Mg,Ti and one of
LiF:Mg,Cu,P detectors. In case of DLR and ATI these were TLD-700 and TLD-600
(LiF:Mg,Ti) chips manufactured by Thermo Fisher Scientiﬁc Inc., while IFJ used the own
production MTS-7 and MTS-6 (LiF:Mg,Ti) as well as MCP-7 (LiF:Mg,Cu,P) pellets. Each
laboratory prepared, processed and evaluated the TLDs using their own standard procedures
(identical with those used within the MTR experiment), which were different in each case.
The details of the used procedures are summarized in the Table 1.

2.2 Experimental procedure

The fading study was accomplished at IFJ Krakow. All TLDs, after annealing at their
home laboratories, were sent to IF] and were divided into several groups, which then
underwent different irradiation and storage procedures. Two storage locations — a laboratory
room (nominal RT, the real average of 18.50C) and a freezer (—17.4OC) — and two radiation
modalities — gamma rays and thermal neutrons — were used. The use of thermal neutrons was
intended for checking a possible inﬂuence of ionization density on fading effects, as densely
ionizing radiation is abundant in space. Thermal neutron irradiations were performed with a
polyethylene-moderated Pu—Be source and were applied only to TLDs highly enriched in 6Li
isotope: TLD-600 and MTS—6. Gamma exposures were realized using the 137Cs source at the
IFJ reference laboratory. The temporal irradiation pattern consisted of exposures at the
beginning, in the middle and close to the end of the storage at IFJ (see Table 2). The gamma-
ray dose was always 40 mGy in terms of absorbed dose in water. In case of thermal neutrons
the exact dose was unknown, but the rough estimate of the ﬂuence is 2><107 cm'z.
Additionally, for gamma rays, a fourth exposure pattern was applied, with the intention of
simulating a continuous irradiation consisting of siX dose fractions of 4 mGy each, equally
distributed over the storage period, which amounted to the total dose of 24 mGy. The storage
period at IFJ lasted 448 days. Afterwards, the TLDs were distributed to the laboratories and
read out about 2.5 months later. The total time of the experiment was 560 days.

For each TLD the absorbed dose was determined using evaluation and calibration
methods applied normally in the respective laboratories for evaluation of TLDs exposed to
unknown doses during space experiments. To check possible differences in calibration

"
"5","applied at ATI, DLR and IFJ, a separate gamma-ray inter-calibration experiment was
additionally realized. In the frame of this experiment, sets of TLDs were exposed to the same
calibration dose at the three reference calibration laboratories (Laboratory for Calibration of
Dosimetric Instruments at IFJ Krakéw, Poland; Materialpriifungsamt Nordrhein-Westfalen in
Dortmund, Germany; Department of Radiotherapy 0f the Medical University of Vienna,
Austria) and evaluated together. The results conﬁrmed an agreement of calibrations between
the reference laboratories within 2.5%.

3. Results

Figures 1 and 2 show examples of the measured glow-curves for various irradiation
patterns and different storage temperatures. It is apparent that the storage and irradiation
conditions had rather small inﬂuence on the glow-curve shape. Glow-curves measured at
DLR (Figs 1a, 2a) eXhibit somewhat increased low-temperature tails, compared to ATI (Figs
1b, 2b) and IF] (Figs 10, 2c) glow-curves. The reason for this behaviour lies in the application
of a pre-heat cycle before readout at the latter laboratories. On the other hand, the main peak
height of DLR TLDs seems to be very stable (Figs 1a, 2a). Glow-curves 0f the samples stored
in a freezer (Fig. 2) are little increased compared to RT storage (Fig. 1), in particular on the
low-temperature side of the main peak. Glow-curves 0f MTS-7 (Fig. 10) and MTS-6 (not
shown) detectors irradiated at the beginning of the storage show stronger presence of peak 4
(at ~ 200°C), indicating some evolution of the structure of corresponding trapping sites during
the ﬁrst days after annealing (time between annealing at the ﬁrst irradiation was shorter in
case of IF] detectors than for ATI and DLR). For ATI TLD-700 a small decrease of the main
peak height during storage was observed (Fig. 1b). For MCP-7 no changes in glow-curve
shape were present.

—> Fig. 2 (one column)

Figures 3 and 4 illustrate how the observed small changes in the glow-curve shape
inﬂuence the performance of TLDs, i.e., how they affect the measured doses. The results are
presented as the relative response. For gamma-ray exposures (Fig.3) the relative response is
deﬁned as the ratio of the measured dose to the true dose value. For neutron exposures
(Fig. 4), where the true dose value was unknown, the measured doses were normalized to the
values obtained for the exposure #3. The results for gamma rays reveal that nearly all data
points lay within 10% around unity (three data points are distanced by exactly 11%).
Moreover, over 80% 0f the data points were found within 5% around unity. The results for the
freezer storage seems to be somewhat more scattered than those for the RT storage, but there
is no direct trend. Similar results were obtained also for the neutron exposures as given in
Figure 4. The higher uncertainties are caused probably by a not perfect uniformity of the
neutron radiation ﬁeld. This lack of a signiﬁcant fading is contrary to some recent papers
(Carinou et al. 2011; GilVin 2007), which report fading up to 20% within 6 months. This may

"
"6","be explained by the simpliﬁed reader annealing procedures used in those studies, instead of
the full oven annealing as applied in the present work.

4. Conclusions

The obtained results indicate a high stability of the studied thermoluminescent
detectors disregarding their producers and the applied annealing and readout conditions.
Nearly all measured doses were Within 10% from the true values, With over 80% 0f the results
Within 5%. Even the longest storage period (about 1.5 years) did not inﬂuence the results in a
signiﬁcant way. No difference was observed between gamma and neutron exposures, as well
as between the two studied storage temperatures. These results indicate that for the properly
oven-annealed LiF TLDs, the fading is not a signiﬁcant problem, even for measuring periods
of more than a year.
