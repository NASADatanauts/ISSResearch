CONCLUSION
The number and velocities of ice particles ejected
outside of the core region, during the startup
(phase 1), initial shutdown (phase 3a) and
shutdown sputtering (phase 3b) phases were
determined. The core of liquid ejected during the
startup and shutdown phases was contained within
a half cone angle of less than 60 degrees. The
startup phase took approximately 36 seconds, the
shutdown initial phase took approximately 22
seconds, and the shutdown sputtering phase took
approximately 32 seconds. Results from the
experiment were compared with the Boeing lSS
