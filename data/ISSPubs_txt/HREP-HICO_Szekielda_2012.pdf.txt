ABSTRACT
The nature of surface manifestations over internal waves was investigated with a new hyperspeetral
scanner on board the International Space Station. F rom observed internal wave patterns in an area close
to the Strait of Gibraltar, it was found that the observed increase in radiance is mainly due to reﬂected
solar irradianee.

INTRODUCTION
Frequent vertical displacement of the pyeno and/or thermoeline by internal waves leads to alternating
convergence and divergence movements that modify sea surface roughness. This surface effect makes it
possible to detect internal waves in various parts of the electromagnetic spectrum from aircraft or satellite
altitudes with various techniques through remote sensing, as reviewed by Klemas (2012). Related to the
vertical displacement of the pyeno and/or thermoeline is the mixing of nutrients into the euphotie zone
that initiates increasing primary production. Thus, internal waves may be responsible for the change in
primary production by modifying the compensation depth of marine phytoplankton. Productivity and
chlorophyll concentrations are not always related to internal waves, as was shown for the South China
Sea, in areas where internal waves occur frequently (Yang et al., 2010). However, the effects of the
internal wave undulations may be parametrieally disguised as an apparent vertical diffused ﬂux of
nutrients with the underlying mechanism principally different from turbulent diffusion (Kahru, 1983).
The building of convergence and divergence zones related to the dynamics of internal waves also leads to
accumulation of organic surface films that compress over the area of convergence and create lines parallel
to the wave crest. In response, capillary waves are damped over the convergence and change in sea state
over the divergence zone, modifying the optical behaVior of the air-sea interface. Depending on the View
angle, either of the two zones may appear either bright or dark.
In the Visible part of the EMS, internal waves are recognizable through changes in ocean color, and the
question arises whether physical or biological processes are responsible for varying reﬂectance or
radiance from the air-sea interface or the water column underneath. In the following, observations of
internal waves from the International Space Station with a Hyperspeetral Imager for the Coastal Ocean
(HICO) will be described. Data were collected in the Vicinity of the Strait of Gibraltar over a spectral
range of 0.4 pm to 0.9 pm , with a spectral resolution of about 6 nm and a ground resolution of about 100
m (Corson et al., 2010; Lueke et al. 2010; Davis et al., 2010). Radiance spectra were extracted, and in
order to negate partially the atmospheric contribution, the sensor to target path radiance data were referred
to water that was considered to be low in chlorophyll concentration. The resulting difference spectra were
Viewed at the same View angle to keep the atmospheric pathlength the same for each scene element.
Therefore, the difference spectra signify the contents or processes related to changes in the water leaving
radiance of the target, thus providing qualitative information on the nature of its scatterers and absorbers.
This approach further assumes that between the analyzed pixels, the atmosphere is comprised of a
homogeneous layer pathlength.

OBSERVATIONS
The internal wave package in Figures 1a and b is shown in an enhanced image at 0.646 mm with the
difference spectrum in Figure 10. The appearance of internal waves has been detected in the Strait of
Gibraltar for many years, and it was found that they are mainly generated by the interaction of a tidal ﬂow
and the bathymetry (Apel et a1., 1975; Frassetto, 1960; Ziegenbein, 1970; Ziegenbein, 1969 and 1970;
Lacombe and Richez, 1982; Armi and Farmer, 1985; 1988; La Violette and Arnone, 1988; Alpers et a1.,
1996; Jackson, 2004).

Figure 1: (a) HICO sub-image showing location where internal waves with a wavelength of about
1000 m were observed at a View angle of 11 degrees to the south/right 0f the direction of motion of
the ISS; (b) enlarged image (a) at 0.646 pm to enhance the presence of internal waves; (c) difference
spectrum (50*radiance in W m'zp.m'1 sr'l) between bright and darker part of the wave package as
indicated by the arrows.
The spectral analysis given in Figure 10 indicates that increased radiance values are mainly caused by
reﬂected solar irradiance. This conclusion is based on the spectral location of merged Fraunhofer lines
that are observed in radiance data but can also be recognized even in atmospherically corrected remote
sensing data (Szekielda et a1. 2009). The above conclusion is veriﬁed with spectra that were derived with
the same procedure applied in the observation for the offshore region of the South West coast of Spain as
shown in Figures 2a and b where coastal water (Case 2 water) is compared with offshore Atlantic Ocean
water, whereas Figures 20 and (1 show the difference spectrum from an algal bloom in Long Island Sound.

Figure 2: Spectra extraction from HICO images in the offshore region of the South West coast of
Spain as shown in 2a and b Where coastal water (Case 2 water) is compared With offshore Atlantic
Ocean water. Figures c shows the location for an algal bloom in the Long Island Sound With the
corresponding difference spectrum in ﬁgure d.. Numbers in ﬁgure (1 and arrows indicate the
spectral position of the main absorbing photosynthetic pigments. Arrows in Figures Za and c
indicate the location of the analyzed spectra.
The target spectrum derived from the coastal area of Spain has the typical spectral response of suspended
sediments and the difference spectrum derived from a plankton bloom in Long Island Sound reveals the
spectral locations of the major photosynthetic pigments. From this comparison, it is evident that the
observed high radiance pattern over the internal waves is due largely to changes in sea state and most
probably through action by capillary waves but not through increased biomass. This conclusion might be
valid only for the observed image shown in this study, but more observations With HICO are available
and Will be further analyzed.
