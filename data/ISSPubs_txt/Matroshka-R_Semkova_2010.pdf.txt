Abstract
Liulin—S is a particle telescope developed for the investigation of the radiation environment Within the Russian spherical tissue—equiV—
alent phantom on the International Space Station (ISS). Liulin—S experiment is conducted aboard the Russian segment of ISS since 28
J une 2007 as an adherent part of the international project MATROSHKA—R. The main objective of Liulin—S experiment is to study the
depth—dose distribution of the different components of the orbital radiation ﬁeld in a human phantom. Additional objectives are mapping
of the radiation environment in the phantom and its variations With time and orbital parameters (such as solar cycle, solar ﬂare events,
inclination and altitude). Liulin—S is an active instrument, capable to provide real—time radiation data for the particle ﬂux and dose rates,
energy deposition and LET spectra. Data are recorded automatically on memory cards, periodically transported to ground by returning
vehicles. In this report we present some ﬁrst results from data analysis including energy deposition spectra, absorbed dose, dose rate and
ﬂux distribution measured simultaneously at 3 different depths of phantom’s radial channel and linear energy transfer (LET) spectrum.
Data discussed are for the period J uly 2007—April 2008.
