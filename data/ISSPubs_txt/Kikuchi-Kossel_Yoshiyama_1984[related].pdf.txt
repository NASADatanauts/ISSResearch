An analysis of Kossel lines is reported for colloidal crystals of highly charged polystyrene
particles in semidilute aqueous solutions. The phase transformation between fcc and bcc
structures and their coexistence is observed. Lattice constants are found to be systematically
smaller than those calculated from the uniform particle distribution throughout solution.
This observation shows that a long-range weak attraction also exists between colloidal parti-
cles. The fine structure of the Kossel line is explained by use of dynamical theory.
