Abstract. A tWO-dimensional multi-scale cellular automaton - ﬁnite element (CAFE) model is
used to simulate grain structure evolution and microsegregation formation during solidiﬁcation
of reﬁned A1—7wt%Si alloys under microgravity. The CAFE simulations are ﬁrst qualitatively
compared With the benchmark experimental data under microgravity. Qualitative agreement is
obtained for the position of columnar t0 equiaxed transition (CET) and the CET transition
mode (sharp 0r progressive). Further comparisons of the distributions of grain elongation factor
and equivalent diameter are conducted and reveal a fair quantitative agreement.
1. Introduction
Grain morphology has a great inﬂuence on the ﬁnal performance of as-cast products [1]. Depending
on the applied processing parameters and the alloy physical properties, solidiﬁed grain structures
could be purely columnar, or totally equiaxed, or a mixture of columnar and equiaxed. Columnar
grains often grow from near the mold surface under a highly imposed thermal gradient [2]. Although,
the castings With columnar structure signiﬁcantly increase the strength in the columnar direction,
columnar structures have been found to be more prone to cracking. Castings 0f equiaxed structure are
desirable for many applications, since they exhibit homogeneity in physical and mechanical properties
[3]. Therefore, an accurate control of columnar-to-equiaxed transition (CET) and a quantitative
understanding of the relationship between CET and casting parameters are essential to industrial
application and scientiﬁc development.

Within the ESA CETSOL (Columnar t0 Equiaxed Transition in SOLidiﬁcation Processing) project,
six experiments With different solidiﬁcation parameters were carried out to study CET transition under
microgravity in the Microgravity Science Laboratory (MSL), using the Low Gradient Furnace (LGF)
on board the International Space Station (188) [4]. Experimental characterizations of the experimental
samples were performed by Zimmermann et a1. [4], Mirihanage et a1. [5] and Liu et a1. [6].
Experimental studies are essential to identify mechanisms at the state of CET. However, during
solidiﬁcation, a complex interplay of multi-scale phenomena cannot be observed and then, numerical
modelling offers the possibility to study the CET mechanism and the parameter impacts in details.

Direct macroscopic modelling, such as cellular automaton - ﬁnite element (CAFE) model, has been
developed by Gandin and co-workers with advantages in numerically investigating CET [7,8]: at the
size of casting, the topological description of grain structure transition and composition heterogeneity
can be realized. Comparisons with benchmark experimental data obtained from microgravity
experiments are necessary to guide further improvement of model.

In this publication, CAF E simulations of CET transition during solidiﬁcation of reﬁned Al-7wt%Si
alloys under microgravity are compared with benchmark experimental data. Three aspects are
considered: distributions of grain equivalent diameter and elongation factor, CET position and CET
transition mode. The inﬂuence of pulling-velocity jump on CET is investigated. The reason why
simulations cannot quantitatively match some of the experimental results is discussed.

2. Experiment
The schematic setup of the sample cartridge assembly inserted in the low gradient furnace (LGF)
available in the Materials Science Laboratory (MSL) on board the International Space Station (188)
was presented in [4-6]. Rod-like samples of 7.8 mm in diameter and 245 mm in length were placed in
a protective A1203 cylindrical crucible. The main solidiﬁcation parameters are summarized in table
1[4]. In the present article, we focus on the samples (FMI / FM5) which are reﬁned Al-7wt%Si alloys
with 0.5 wt % A1 — 5 wt% Ti — 1 wt% B reﬁner. Processing conditions are identical except the pulling
velocity. In F M1, a pulling-velocity jump is applied from 0.01 mm s'1 in stage I to 0.2 mm s'1 in stage
II. For F M5 , the pulling velocity keeps at a low constant value, 0.01 mm s'l, through stages I and II.

The characterization of the experimental grain structure was performed using electron
backscattered diffraction (EBSD). For each identiﬁed grain, the grain equivalent diameter and grain
elongation factor were calculated based on the numerical analyses of EBSD output data ﬁle. The
equivalent diameter of a non-spherical obj ect is equal to the diameter of a sphere of equivalent area [6].
The elongation factor is deﬁned as the maj 0r aXis length to the minor aXis length ratio. The two axes
intersect orthogonally at the centroid of the grain [6].

The end of columnar growth is determined by Visual examination of the polished sample surface.
On the one hand, the highest position of dendrites Which develop from the beginning of solidiﬁcation
is named as CETmm, that is the top boundary of columnar zone. On the other hand, the deﬁnition of
CET position between transition zone and equiaxed region is dependent on the distribution pattern of
averaged elongation factor along the solidiﬁcation direction. A critical elongation factor equal to 2 [9]
is chosen as a criterion. If the proﬁle of the averaged elongation factor varies around 2 Within an area,
an intermediate zone eXists Where equiaxed and short elongated grains coeXist. If the proﬁle drops
below 2 at a position and barely bounces back, an equiaxed region is established and this position is
deﬁned as CETmaX. If there is only CETmm identiﬁed, a sharp CET from columnar to equiaxed grains
occurs. If CETmm and CETmax coexist, an intermediate region forms and the CET mode is progressive.

The difference in CET transition manner between F M1 and F M5 is explained as: a pulling-velocity
jump used in FMl leads to a higher degree of constitutional undercooling ahead of the solidiﬁcation
front. Under such condition, the nucleation rate is enhanced. With an intensive and frequent nucleation
of grains in the liquid, the newly nucleated grains compete over the continued growth of existing
grains to form a truly equiaxed zone after columnar zone [9].

3. Modelling

3.1. CAFE modelling

Conservation equations over ﬁnite element mesh (F E) are solved using a volume averaging approach.
A more detailed presentation of these equations is presented elsewhere [7,8]. For simulation of
solidiﬁcation under microgravity, the computation of momentum equation is switched off. A few
assumptions are made. (i) Equal and constant densities in the phases. (ii) No movement of solid phase.
(iii) Only heterogeneous nucleation of equiaxed grains is considered.

The F E mesh is divided into a regular lattice of ﬁne square named CA cells. The CA technique is
used to track the development of grain envelopes. A Gaussian distribution is adopted to describe
nucleation of equiaxed grains [8]. Three input parameters are needed: mean nucleation undercooling
ATmean, the standard deviation AT6 and maximum nucleation density Nmax. A dendrite tip kinetics
deﬁned in [8] is used to calculate dendrite growth.

3.2. Calculation domain, boundary and initial conditions

The experimental system that includes the sample cartridge assembly and the heating system is not
directly simulated. The right half of cylindrical geometries, including alloy sample, crucible and plug,
are chosen as the computational domains (ﬁgure 1). The conﬁguration is two-dimensional and
aXi-symmetrical. Since the bottom part of the sample ranging from 0 mm to 70 mm remains at solid
state through the Whole experimental process, the alloy sample is numerically divided into two parts.
The top part is simulated using CAF E model and the bottom using only F E model.

To simulate the directional solidiﬁcation, Dirichlet thermal boundary conditions [10] are used in
this study by imposing temperature proﬁles on the outer surface of three sub-domains “plug”, “top
crucible” and “bottom crucible”.

Twelve input cooling curves (TCl to TC12) are placed on the outer surface of the top crucible
(ﬁgure 1) and correspond to experimentally measured proﬁles. The thermocouple positions range from
(TCl) 72.5 mm to (TC12) 182.5 mm deﬁned from the reference plane (0 mm). Another ﬁve
temperature proﬁles (SCO: -5.0 mm, SC13: 202.5 mm, SC14: 222.5 mm, SC15: 243.0 mm and SC16:
281.5 mm) are imposed to strictly maintain the unidirectional heat ﬂow through the “A17Si alloy”
domain. These temperature proﬁles are deﬁned as a function of time by propagating the time evolution
of the temperature gradients between thermocouples TCl and TC2, TC11 and TC12, TC12 and SC13,
SC13 and SC14, SC14 and SC15.

At the beginning of the simulation, the Whole system has an initial temperature of 800.0 0C. F ive
nuclei With different growth orientations and With a nucleation undercooling of 0 0C are ﬁxed at the
bottom boundary of “A17Si alloy” domain to reproduce the columnar grain nucleation and competition.

CAFE model is used through the software XR2801-CAFE developed by MINES ParisTech
CEMEF. The thermo-physical properties of Al-7wt% Si alloy are presented in details in [11]. Here,
only critical parameters used in the present CAFE simulations are listed. FE mesh size is 0.3 mm and
CA cell size 0.04 mm. The heat transfer coefﬁcients at alloy / crucible, alloy / plug and crucible / plug
interfaces are 104 W m'2 0Cl, 103 W m'2 0C1 and 103 W m'2 OC'l, respectively. The nucleation
parameters ATmean = 4 OC, ATS = 0.5 0C and Nmax = 5 X 1010 m'3 are chosen to get a match With the
experimentally observed grain structures in FMl. All these parameters stay the same for different
simulation cases. These parameters are kept constant for all the simulations.

4. Results and discussion

4.1. CAFE Simulation ofgrain structure

Figure 2 compares the distributions of averaged grain elongation factor and equivalent diameter along
two sections (L4 and L5) cut in the longitudinal direction obtained from EBSD analyses (dashed line)
and from CAFE simulations (solid line) [12]. The experimental CET values given here agree With the
values obtained from grain size analysis in [13]. According to the deﬁnition methodology proposed in
section 2, for FMl, the predicted CETmm is 130 mm very close to the measured 127 mm (ﬁgure 2(a)).
For FMS, both simulation and experiment show two CET positions (ﬁgure 2(a)). The simulated
CETmm is 140 mm that is 10 mm higher than the measured 130 mm. The predicted CETmax is 165 mm
Which is 9 mm higher than the measured 156 mm.

A good agreement between simulation and experiment is obtained for the distribution of grain
equivalent diameter for FMl (ﬁgure 2(b)). In simulations, 67 % and 78 % grains With a diameter
smaller than 1.0 mm on sections L4 and L5 are measured, respectively, Which is close to the respective
experimental measurements of 65 % and 63%. For FMS (ﬁgure 2(b)), the general tendency that grain
size decreases from the intermediate zone to the equiaxed zone is reproduced. Without the application
of the pulling-velocity jump, both simulation and experiment present a coarse and non-homogenous
grain structure. In simulations, 19% and 31 % grains With a diameter smaller than 1.0 mm on sections
L4 and L5 are measured respectively, Which are different from the respective experimental
measurements of 43% and 53 %. Difference between simulations and experiments is attributed to the
fact that the formation and development of the grain structure in the tWO-dimensional aXi-symmetrical
simulation do not exactly correspond to the real experiments regarding the number of effective nuclei,
the random growing orientations, and the branching in 3D. This discrepancy is less pronounced for the
cases Where many grains are formed, because statistical reasons minor these effects.

F igure 3 compares grain structures on section L4 obtained from EBSD analyses (ﬁgures 3(a) and

(0)) and from CAF E simulations (ﬁgures 3(b) and (d)) [12]. From the simulated grain structures, it can

be noted that the CET is sharp for FMl (ﬁgure 3(b)) since there is only one CET position (CETmm).

For FM5 (ﬁgure 3(d)), the CET is progressive. The two CET positions (CETmm and CETmaX) are

located on sections L4 and L5, respectively. The predicted CET transition mode is consistent With

experimental observations.

5. Conclusion

Numerical simulations of two MSL-LGF microgravity experiments (F M1 and F M5) performed using

CAF E model are compared qualitatively and quantitatively With the experiments. The inﬂuence of the

pulling velocity on the grain structure is qualitatively and quantitatively reﬂected in CAF E

simulations. The CET transition mode, be it sharp 0r progressive, is retrieved. Distributions of grain

elongation factor and equivalent diameter are fairly reproduced. The discrepancy between the

predicted and measured CET positions is due to the fact that the grain structure development in the

two-dimensional aXi-symmetrical simulations does not correspond to that in the experiments regarding

the nucleation positions and growth orientations. The distributions of grain size and elongation factor

are retrieved but cannot be perfectly identical With experimental measurements due to the statistical

aspect of nucleation events.
