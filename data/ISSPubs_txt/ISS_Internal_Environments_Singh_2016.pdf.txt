Draft genome sequences of Aspergillus fumigatus strains (ISSFT-021 and IFlSW-F4), opportunistic pathogens isolated from the
International Space Station (ISS), were assembled to facilitate investigations of the nature of the Virulence characteristics of the
ISS strains to other clinical strains isolated on Earth.
