Control of water and air in the root zone of plants remains a Challenge in the microgravity environment of
space. Due to limited ﬂight opportunities, research aimed at resolving microgravity porous media ﬂuid
dynamics must often be conducted on Earth. The NASA KC—135 reduced graVity ﬂight program offers
an opportunity for Earth—based researchers to study physical processes in a variable graVity environment.
The obj ectives of this study were to obtain measurements of water content and matric potential during the
parabolic profile ﬂown by the KC—135 aircraft. The ﬂight profile provided 20—25 s of microgravity at the
top of the parabola, while pulling 1.8 g at the bottom. The soil moisture sensors (Temperature and Mois—
ture Acquisition System: Orbital Technologies, Madison, WI) used a heat—pulse method to indirectly
estimate water content from heat dissipation. Tensiometers were constructed using a stainless steel po—
rous cup with a pressure transducer and were used to measure the matric potential of the medium. The
two types of sensors were placed at different depths in a substrate compartment filled with 1—2 mm
Turface (calcined Clay). The ability of the heat—pulse sensors to monitor overall Changes in water content
in the substrate compartment decreased with water content. Differences in measured water content data
recorded at 0, 1, and 1.8 g were not signiﬁcant. Tensiometer readings tracked pressure differences due to
the hydrostatic force Changes with variable graVity. The readings may have been affected by Changes in
cabin air pressure that occurred during each parabola. Tensiometer porous membrane conductivity (func—
tion of pore size) and ﬂuid volume both inﬂuence response time. Porous media sample height and water
content inﬂuence time—to—equilibrium, where shorter samples and higher water content achieve faster
equilibrium. Further testing is needed to develop these sensors for space ﬂight applications.
