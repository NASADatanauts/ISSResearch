Abstract
Samples of the extremotolerant Antarctic endemite lichen Buellia frigida are currently exposed to low—Earth orbit—
spaoe and simulated Mars conditions at the Biology and Mars Experiment (BIOMEX), which is part of the ESA
mission EXPOSE—R2 on the International Space Station and was launched on 23 July 2014. In preparation for the
mission, several preﬂight tests (Experimental and Scientiﬁc Veriﬁcation Tests, EVT and SVT) assessed the sample
preparation and hardware integration procedures as well as the resistance of the candidate organism toward the
abiotic stressors experienced under space and Mars conditions. Therefore, we quantiﬁed the post—eXposure Viability
with a live/dead staining technique utilizing FUN—l and confocal laser scanning microscopy (CLSM). In addition,
we used scanning electron microscopy (SEM) to investigate putative patterns of morphological—anatomical damage
that lichens may suffer under the extreme exposure conditions. The present results demonstrate that Buellia frigida
is capable of surviving the conditions tested in EVT and SVT. The mycobiont showed lower average impairment of
its Viability than the photobiont (Viability rates of >83% and >69%, respectively), and the lichen thallus suffered no
signiﬁcant damage in terms of thalline integrity and symbiotic contact. These results will become essential to
substantiate and validate the results prospectively obtained from the returning space mission. Moreover, they will
help assess the limits and limitations of terrestrial organisms under space and Mars conditions as well as Char—
acterize the adaptive traits that confer lichen extremotolerance. Key Words: Astrobiology—BIOMEX—EXPOSE—

FIG. 2. Cross sections of B. frigida stained with FUN—l and documented by CLSM. The micrographs depict mostly Vital
thallus areas in 2a—2b and 2d—2f and mostly metabolically inactive thallus areas in 2c. The stratiﬁcation of the thallus is
presented by the epicortical gelatinous sheath (6); the cortex (6), which is encrusted with melanin and thus dark in
ﬂuorescence microscopy; the layer of clustered algal cells (a); and the medulla (m, 2a—2b). Areas of intense production of
extracellular gelatinous substances (g) are found occasionally (2b, 2d). Some areas of the investigated thallus sections show
exposure—induced impairment of photobiont Vitality and are predominantly metabolically inactive (2c), as demonstrated by
the green—colored hyphal cells of the mycobiont (im) and 0f the photobiont (ip), While degenerating photobionts (dp) are
intensely stained by passively accumulating dye (2c, 2e). Metabolically active photobiont cells are characterized by the
accumulation and pH—induced change of color in small spherical vacuoles at the margin of the algal cells (ap, 2e). Within
the medulla of several samples (2f), yet—unidentiﬁed metabolically active cell clusters survive the exposure conditions
(encircled areas), neither resembling fungal hyphae nor algal cells. The samples are (2a) SVT, rock, non—irradiated; (2b)
