M1orograv1ty metal prooessmg: from undercooled 11qu1ds to
bulk metalho glasses
Douglas C Hofmannt'2 and Scott N Robertst'2

Bulk metallic glasses (BMGs) are a novel class of metal alloys that are poised for widespread commercialization. Over 30 years of

NASA and ESA (as well as other space agency) funding for both ground-based and microgravity experiments has resulted in

fundamental science data that have enabled commercial production. This review focuses on the history of microgravity BMG

research, which includes experiments on the space shuttle, the ISS, ground—based experiments, commercial fabrication and

currently funded efforts.
