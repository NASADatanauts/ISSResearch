v ABSTRACT

This experiment was conducted as pan of a risk mitigation payload aboard the Space Shuttle Atlantis on STS-lOl.
The obj ectives were to test a newly developed water delivery system, and to determine the optimal combination of
water volume and substrate for the imbibition and germination of ﬂax (Linum usitatis'simum) seeds in space. Two
different combinations of germination paper were tested for their ability to absorb, distribute, and retain water in
microgravity. A single layer of thick germination paper was compared With one layer of thin gemlination paper
under a layer of thick paper. Paper strips were cut to ﬁt snugly into seed cassettes, and seeds were glued to them
with the micropyle ends pointing outward. Water was delivered in small increments that traveled through the paper
via capillary action. Three water delivery volumes were tested, with the largest (480 pL) outperforming the 400 0L
and 320 pL volumes for percent germination (90.6%) and root growth (mean = 4.1 mm) during the 34-hour
space ﬂight experiment. The ground control experiment yielded similar results, but with lower rates of germination
(84.4%) and shorter root lengths (mean = 2.8 mm). It is not clear if the roots emerged more quickly in
microgravity and/or grew faster than the ground controls. The single layer of thick germination paper generally
exhibited better overall growth than the two layered option. Signiﬁcant seed position effects were observed in both
the ﬂight and ground control experiments. Overall, the design of the water delivery system, seed cassettes and the
germination paper strip concept was validated as an eﬁ‘ective method for promoting seed germination and root
growth under microgravity conditions. © 2003 COSPAR. Published by Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.
INTRODUCTION ‘

The BIOTUBE Precursor risk mitigation experiment was designed to assess critical technologies and protocols
to be used in the upcoming BIOTUBE/Magnetic Field Apparatus (MFA) experiment on STS-107 (Anderson et a1.,
2000). It ﬂew aboard the Space Shuttle Atlantis on STS-lOl (launched May 19, 2000) and had a mission duration
of 9 days 20 hours. The experiment's objectives were: (1) to provide a demonstration and test of a newly deve10ped
water delivery system, (2) to investigate potential risk factors associated with the new hardware, and (3) to
determine the optimal water volume and germination paper combination for ﬂax. Because the BIOTUBE/MFA
experiment contains seeds that are launched dly and imbibed on orbit, the successful delivery of water to the seeds
is critical for germination and overall success of the experiment. To evaluate the system, germination paper of
varying thickness and layers was tested for its ability to absorb, distribute and retain water in weightlessness.
Under microgravity conditions, the surface tension of water can cause excess water to pool on the surfaces of seeds
that, combined with the lack of convective gas exchange, forms a barrier to oxygen uptake. If the barrier forms
prior to seed germinatien, the seeds may die. The BIOTUBE Precursor experiment tested a method to alleviate this
problem. By delivering water in small increments, the water slowly traveled [down the gennination paper via
capillary action and thereby eliminated the complications caused by excess water pooling around seed surfaces.

METHODOLOGY
The Magnetic Field Chamber (MFC) is a six—sided, rectangular box (19 x 15 x 5.8 cm; Figure 1) with a
transparent polycarbonate cover and a silicone gasket. A total of three MFC’s ﬂew as part of the BIOTUBE
Precursor payload. Eight polycarbonate seed cassettes (5.1 x 3.3 x 1.0 cm; Figure 2A) were ﬂown in each MFC.
Each seed cassette held eight seeds and provided a water port to imbibe the seeds on orbit. Each seed cassette
contained germination paper with eight ﬂax seeds attached (Figure 2B).

The germination paper was cut into 4 cm x 1.6 cm pieces to ﬁt snugly into the seed cassettes. The strips
functioned as liquid distributors and reservoirs for the germinating seeds by wicking the introduced water into
contact with the dry seeds. Two paper combinations using heavy (“H”) and normal (“N ”) thickness

Germination paper (Seedboro Equipment Co., Chicago, IL; 400HPT and 400PT, respectively) were tested for the
ability to absorb, distribute and retain water in microgravity. The ﬁrst consisted of one layer of “H” paper, the
second consisted of one layer of “H” paper on top of one layer of “N” paper, resulting in a treatment referred to as
“N+H.” In both cases, ﬂax seeds (Linum usitatissimum) were attached by applying gum guar (1.25%w/v) drops
to pre-marked spots located at 5, 14, 23 and 32 mm from the front edges of the ""H"" paper strips (Figure 2B). Four
seeds were glued to each side of the long edge of the substrate strips with the micrOpyle facing the paper edge.
The seeds were aligned perpendicular to the long paper edges to assure a precise orientation of the roots upon
emergence. Within each MFC, 4 seed cassettes (and therefore 32 seeds) were “H” treatments and the remaining
four (containing 32 seeds) were “N+H” treatments (in alternating positions).

The Small Quantity Imbibition Delivery System (SQUID; F igure 3) was a hand-operated water-dispensing
device (8.6 x 5.1 x 3.8 cm) designed for this experiment. Each SQUID included a syringe-like watering device
with eight pistons and barrels that were attached via Teﬂon® tubes to the back of an MFC (Figure 4). A twist
handle enabled a crew member to deliver the prescribed amount of water to the seed cassettes. The total water
volume delivered by each SQUID varied per treatment, with SQUID A delivering 480 p.L of water to each of the
8 seed cassettes in MFC A, SQUID B delivering 400 pL of water to each of the 8 seed cassettes in MFC B, and
SQUID C delivering 320 pL of water to each of the 8 seed cassettes in MFC C. A HOBO® temperature data
logger (Onset Computer Corp., Pocasset, MA) was inserted into the back cavity of each MFC and secured with
Velcro (Figure 4).

The entire payload was contained within a Space Shuttle single stoWage tray (Figure 5). Double-distilled water
was placed in a vacuum chamber for 15 minutes to evacuate air bubbles and then ﬁlled into each SQUID (but not
into the attached Teﬂon tubing). The tubing was then connected to the corresponding MFC. The stowage tray
was installed into the locker, and transferred to the pad approximately 48 h prior to launch.

There were two in-ﬂight— water delivery sessions. At landing minus 31:04 hours, the astronaut made 5 turns of
the handles on each of the three SQUIDs (delivering 5/8 of the ﬁnal volumes, i.e., 200-, 250~.and 300 “L
respectively). The second water delivery occurred at landing minus 6 hours 15 minutes, when the remaining 3/8 of
the volumes (120-, 150- and 180 uL respectively) were dispensed (3 turns of the respective handles). The
experiment tray was received two hours and forty-three minutes following landing, and all tissue was ﬁxed within
a half hour after receipt by submerging the seed cassettes into individual vials containing 4% formaldehyde. After
two days, the roots were measured. The seedlings were thus exposed to microgravity for about 30 hours, followed
by varying levels of gravity during landing and prior to ﬁxation. The total age of the seedlings at the time of
ﬁxation was about 34 hours. Each wetness level treatment was applied to 8 seed cassettes (within separate MFCs),
each of which contained 8 seeds for a total of 64 seeds per wetness level treatment. -

Two months following the STS-lOl landing the ground control experiment was conducted in the Orbiter
Environmental Simulator (OES) at the Kennedy Space Center Life Sciences Support Facility. The CBS simulated
the environmental conditions seen on the Orbiter, including relative humidity, temperature and carbon dioxide. The
samples were loaded into the same hardware ﬂown on STS-lOl and preparations for turnover were identical to the
ﬂight operations. The ﬂight HOBO temperature data were used to provide an accurate representation of
temperature conditiOns inside of the precursor tray. A11 in-ﬂight and post-ﬂight Operations were undertaken at
comparable time-points to the ﬂight experiment.

Data were statistically analyzed by performing a series of two treatment t-tests (assuming unequal variances)
using two-tail diétribution p values with statistical signiﬁcance (*) assigned at or T-'~ 0.05. When p values were
below 0.01 they were assigned a highly signiﬁcant designation (* *), and those below 0.001 were labeled ***. NS
signiﬁes comparisons which were not signiﬁcantly different. In Figures 7, 9,and 10, statistically indistinguishable
groupings were indicated by using the convention of placing lower case letters above the treatment means being
compared.

RESULTS AND DISCUSSION

The overall germination rate in the ﬂight experiment was 77%, with the 480 pL germination rate (90.6%)
exceeding the 400 pL (79.7%) and 320 pL (60.9%) germination rates (Figure 6A). The ground control showed
similar results. The 480 pL treaunent (84.4%) had the highest percentage of germination, followed by 62.5% and
29.7% for the 400 pL and 320 pL treatments, respectively. The two paper treatments exhibited equivalent
germination rates within the ""best"" 480 ttL treatment from both the ﬂight and ground control experiments. The
400 p.L water delivery for the ﬂight ""H"" substrate slightly outperformed the ""N+H"" treatment whereas the ""N+H""
treatment was slightly better than the ""H"" treatment in the ground control. -

The ﬂight experiment showed statistically signiﬁcant differences between the 480, 400 and 320 pL water

treatments (Figure 7A), with the 480 ttL treatment producing signiﬁcantly longer roots than the 400 pL treatment,

and the latter yielding roots which were signiﬁcantly longer than the 320 pL treatment. Roots from the ground

control (Figure 7B) were signiﬁcantly shorter than their ﬂight counterparts except at the 320 “L level, and the 320

nL ground control roots were signiﬁcantly shorter than those obtained from the 480 pL and 400 ML ground control
treatments (which were statistically indistinguishable).

The two substrate treatments in the ﬂight experiment (Figure 8A), showed no difference in root lengths,
although in the 400 and 320 pL treatments the ""H"" treatments averaged slightly longer roots than the ""N+H""
treatments. However, in the ground control 480 [1L treatment, the ""N+H"" strips signiﬁcantly outperformed their
""H"" counterparts. This suggests a slight excess of water that was reduced by the presence of the second paper strip,
and may indicate that the optimum rate of water provision for the single ""H"" strip case would be somewhere,
between 400 and 480 pL (at least for the ground control experiment).

Because of the design 0f the seed cassettes, 7 FLIGHT

seeds in positions A&E were ﬁrst exposed to the E A a b c
delivered water (Figure 23). Then the water E 6 J
moved"" via capillary action toward seeds in ' E 5
positions D&H. If water volumes are less than 5 4 '

the wettest condition at seed positions A&E, to a 3
the driest at seed positions D&H. Roots in s 2 -
positions D&H will be imaged by a video system Q

We observed signiﬁcant position effects in both MFC A (480) ‘ MFC B (400) MFC C (320)
the ﬂight and ground control experiments (Figures
9, 10). This effect was not as prevalent in earlier #I [til
ground experiments in which there were much
longer root growth intervals (typically 42 h vs. 34
h) that resulted in much greater variability in the GROUND CONTROL
root length data sets. In addition to being of a A 7 B
shorter than optimum duration, the precursor E 6
spaceﬂight experiment ended up on the lower end V 5

nature of the experiment coupled with crew U 4 I

ground control were signiﬁcantly longer in positions A&E compared to C&G and D&H. B&F was also
statistically distinguishable from the D&H positions. No signiﬁcant differences were noted in the 320 pL ground

For the ﬂight experiment, “N+H” paper and 480 nL resulted in roots in positions A&E significantly longer than
roots in locations more removed from the site of water input (Figure 10A). Similarly, those in positions “B&F”
were statistically longer than those in positions “D&H”. For the 400 pL treatment, roots in positions “D&H” were
signiﬁcantly shorter than roots at the other (wetter) positions. No signiﬁcant differences were noted in the 320 pL
ﬂight experiment treatment. For the ground control “N+H” treatment (Figure 108), roots in the 480 pL “A&E”
treatment were signiﬁcantly longer than those in the “C&G” and “D&H” positions. No signiﬁeant differences
were noted in the 400 and 320 “L ground control treatments. The results from Figures 9 and 10 show clear
position effects that have implications for the BIOTUBE/MFA experiment since video images of roots will be
taken from the positions that yielded the shortest overall root lengths (i.e., “D&H”).

Fig. 11. Projected root lengths as a function of temperature. The emp'irically—deri ved root length polynomial was
used to predict ﬂax root lengths for mission durations of 30-34 hours at temperatures ranging between 23-35° C.
Prior to ﬂight, an extensive series of laboratory tests was performed to empirically model expected ﬂax seedlin g
root lengths as a Motion of temperature (Figure 11). This predictive equation was to be one means of
determining the time of ﬁxation for the STS-107 ﬂight. The mean temperature (derived from the HOBO“
temperature data loggers inserted into each of the three MFCs) for the portion of the BIOTUBE Precursor ﬂight
experiment extending from the time of imbibition through recovery was 243° C (range = 23.6°-24.8° C). The
comparable temperature for the ground control experiment was 23.6° C (range = 23.2°-23.9° C). The biologically
relevant duration for both experiments (i.e., ﬁ'om time of imbibition through ﬁxation at recovery) was 34 hours.
Figure 11 presents both the observed root lengths from the ﬂight and ground control experiments and the
experiment durations expected to produce the observed root lengths based upon this lab-generated algorithm.
Unexpectedly, the lengths of theroots obtained from the two experiments were found to match those which were
predicted for experiment durations of only 31 hours (ﬂight) or 30 hours (ground control). This corresponded to
durations of 3 and 4 hours less than the 34-hour experiments. We believe that part of this difference is attributable
to the algorithm under-emphasizing the cooler temperature ranges experienced during the MFA Precursor
experiment. Most mid-deck Space Shuttle experiments are exposed to warmer temperatures than was the case
here, and the data set used to generate the algorithm was sparse at these temperatures. However, despite the
polynomial being off by 3-4 hours, the fact that this offset was 25% less for the ﬂight experiment may reﬂect
another example of microgravity conditions resulting in enhanced root production relative to ground controls
(Levine and Krikorian, 1996; Levineet al., 2000).

CONCLUSIONS

1) The incremental delivery of water by the SQUIDs was validated as an effective method for the imbibition of dry

seeds under microgravity conditions. ' .

2) The 480 pL treatment provided the best water volume for percent germination and overall root growth.

However, there was some indication that the 480 pL treatment was slightly too wet for the ground control. This

argues for a slight reduction in the overall quantity of water to be delivered, e.g., 450 “L. Of critical importance is

the indication that the optimum wetness level in microgravity is not the same as the optimum wetness level under

conditions of lg. A11 spaceﬂight experiments should carefully weigh the implications of this ﬁnding when

planning water delivery for ﬂight and ground control experiments.

3) Seedlings germinated on the single layer of ""heavy"" germination paper generally exhibited better overall root

growth than'the (N+H) option. This in conjunction with the simplicity of using a single strip per seed cassette

argues in favor of a single layer for the BIOTUBE/MFA ﬂight experiment.

4) Both the germination rates and ﬁnal ﬂax root lengths were greater in the microgravity ﬂight experiment than in

the lg ground control. It is not clear if the roots emerged more quickly in microgravity and/or grew faster than the

ground controls. Possible explanations could relate to changes in the temperature or moisture environment in

microgravity compared to lg. There may also be a physiological basis for the better perfonnance of the roots in

microgravity.

5) Signiﬁcant seed position effects were observed in both the ﬂight and ground control experiments. This position

effect was not observed in previous ground testing presumably due to a combination of higher temperatures and

longer experimental durations. All previous tests showed greater variability that made it impossible to discern this

effect statistically.

6) Our preferred method for the detennination of time of ﬁxation during the BIOTUBE/MFA experiment on STS«

107 will be to use downlinked images of the roots to help predict the optimum root length and thereby adjust the

ﬁxation time. Results obtained from the precursor experiment will aid in the reﬁnement of the algorithm for the

determination of automatic termination of the experiment if downlinks are not available.

7) Since the success of the BIOTUBE/MFA experiment is dependent on seed germination and root growth, the

BIOTUBE Precursor results have proven invaluable in answering questions related to the design of the water

delivery subsystem. This experiment showed that well designed “technology demonstration” spaceﬂight

experiments can reduce risk and yie 1d better science for the investigator at minimal cost. '
