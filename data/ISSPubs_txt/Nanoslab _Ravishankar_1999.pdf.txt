ABSTRACT

Nana Silicalite-l and TS-l with particle sizes of 2-3 nm are synthesized from clear solutions
prepared from TEOS, TBOT, TPAOH and water, isolated as powders and characterized using
TGA, IR, UV~VIS DRS and ‘3C MAS NMR. TPAOH physisorbed at the external surface of the
nano particles can be removed by heating at 503 K without causing structural damage. Attempts
to remove the occluded TPA by calcination and UV irradiation resulted in structural collapse. In
phenol hydroxylation and l-hexene epoxidation, nano T 3-1 with occluded template exhibits
catalytic activity and selectivity similar to that of conventional TS-l.
INTRODUCTION

Depending on synthesis conditions, the particle size of Silicalite—l (Sil-l) [1] can be varied
from hundreds of micrometers [2] to a few tens of nanometers [3,4]. Clear solutions prepared at
room temperature by mixing telraethyl orthosilicate (TEOS), tetrapropyl ammonium hydroxide
(T PAOH) and water in the appropriate proportions contain very small embryonic particles with
dimensions of ca. 2 to 3 nm and having Sil-l properties [5]. The detailed structure and
dimensions of these nano Sil-l type species abundantly present in solution will be reported
elsewhere [6]. In this paper we have concentrated on the isolation of the nano particles from the
solution, removal of the occluded template from these particles, characterization of the
nanophase powder by thermogravimetric analysis and Spectroscopic techniques and on the
catalytic activity of titanium containing specimens in hydroxylation and epoxidation reactions
catalyzed by conventional TS-l using P1202 as the oxidant.

"3","EXPERIMENTAL Q
The synthesis recipe for the nano particles was adapted from ref.5. At 293 K, 9.0 g of TEOS ~
was added dropwise to a vigorously stirred aqueous solution containing 7.9 g of TPAOH (Fluka, ""
40 % aqeous solution). After 30 minutes, 9 g of distilled water was added dropwise and stirring .
continued for 24 h. Instead of heating to 373 K as for the synthesis of colioidal Sil—l [4,7], the .
clear solution was cooled to 273 K. An amount of 5 ml of it was added to 15 ml of 0.5 NHC] ‘
aqueous solution, pre-cooled at 273 K. After 30 min., 20 ml of tetrahydrofuran (THF) was added .
and stirring was continued for 30 min. Addition of 10.7 g of NaCl resulted in phase separation. ‘
The THF layer containing the nano particles was separated from the aqueous layer using a .
separating funnel. The extraction with THF was repeated thrice to ensure maximum extraction :
efﬁciency. Finally, THF was evaporated at 333 K to obtain the nano-powder of Sil-l. In the '
preparation of nano TS-I, a trace amount of tetrabutyl orthotitanate (TBOT) {Ti/(Ti+Si) = 1.5 i.
%} was added after the hydrolysis of the T308. '
TG/DTA were carried out on a Setaram instrument (Model 92-12) on 20 mg of sample
heated from 293 K to 773 K at a heating rate of S K min"" under 20 vol.% of oxygen in helium '
atmosphere. The difﬁlse reﬂectance UV-VIS spectrum was recorded on a Varian Cary 5 ,
spectrophotometer using halon white reﬂectance standard. The FTIR spectra were recorded using
the KBr pellet technique on a Nicolet 730 instrument. The spectra were averaged over 400 scans
with a resolution of 2 cm"". The nitrogen adsorption isotherm was recorded at 77.23 K using a
Coulter Omnisorp instrument on a sample degassed at 383 K for 4 h. Decoupled l3C MAS NMR 3
measurements were carried out on a Bruker 300 MSL instrument at 75.5 MHz using a contact :
time of 3 ms, a delay time of 5 s, a spinning rate of 4 kHz and TMS as the reference. .
CHARACTERIZATION OF THE NANO~POWDERS ?
The TG/DTA proﬁles of the nano Sil-I and nano TS-l samples were very similar. The 'I
TG/DTA proﬁle for the as~synthesized (as-synth.) nano TS-l is shown in Figure 1. There is an ,
endothermic weight loss of 4.8 % below 425 K ascribed to water (I). The endothermic weight
loss (11) of 2.2 wt.% (on dry weight basis) from 425 to 513 K is ascribed to desorption of :
TPAOH hour the extemai surfaces of the particles. For comparison, weight loss of type II in I
TPA—Sil-l with particle size of 20-100 nm represent 1.5 Wt.% [7], whereas they are not observed '
1'11 micron size Sil-l. onthennic weight loss III (6.6 wt.%) at higher temperatures is ascribed to
occluded TPAOH and TPA‘-Si0- . Owing to the small particle size and the abundance of .

considerably lower than in larger crystals of TPA—Sil—l. Micron size Sil—l [2] and colloidal Sil-l ;
crystals [7] have almost 4 TPA/96 T sites (every intersection occupied with 1 TPA), whereas -
based on weight loss III, (Figure 1) the as-synth. nano TS-l contains only ca. 2.0 occluded TPA
molecules per 96 T sites. In addition, 0.7 TPAOH molecules per 96 T atoms are located in the '
incomplete channel intersections at the particle boundaries (weight loss II, Figure 1).

The FTIR spectrum of a reference, as-synth. colloidal Sil-l sample (particle size of 20-100 :
mu [’3‘], is compared to that of nano Si1~1 and nano TS-l in Figure 2 (a-c). The three samples I
exhibit a band in the region 550—590 cm"", characteristic of a pentasil framework [8]. The
inere ase in particle size from 2-3 am to 20-100 nm gives rise to a shift of this structure sensitive
band from 590 - 570 cm“ to 570- 550 cm"".
Partially calcined nano TS-l (PC nano TS-l) devoid of physisorbed TPAOH according to
TGIDTA was prepared by gentle heating of the as—synth. sample at 503 K in ﬂowing helium.
After partial caleination, the absorption maximum is shifted from 570 cm"" (Figure 20) to 560
cm"" (Figure 2d), suggesting some increase in particle size. The B.B.T. speciﬁc surface area of
the partially calcined nano TS-l (PC TS—l) determined with nitrogen physisorption was 291 m2
g"".
Aﬁer calcination at 823 K in a mufﬂe fumace for 2 h, and subsequently under oxygen ﬂow
for [0 h, the band at 570 cm"" became very weak, indicating the collapse of the MFI framework

methanol and exposed to UV radiation (7L = 350 nm). In a sample irradiated for 15 min, the
absorbance in the 550-590 cm"" region became very weak (Figure 2f). It is concluded that the
removal of the template from the nano powders without causing damage to the structure is very A
difﬁcult.
The absorption around 960 cm"" in as-synth. and PC nano Sil-l/TS-l samples is attri buted to I
silanols and to the Si-O vibration perturbed by linkage to a Ti atom [9]. Upon deuteration with
020, the band around 960 cm‘1 disappears and shiﬂs to the Si-O region in the case ofnano Sil-l, _
wh ereas there is a residual absorbance in the nano TS-l (spectra not shown). ‘ '

The presence of an absorption maximum below 250 nm in the UV-VIS DRS spectrum of as-
synth. nano TS-l (Figure 3) is indicative of isolated, tetrahedral Ti(IV) sites. The weak '
absorption at larger wavelengths can be due to the formation of octahedral Ti sites through the
insertion of water ligands. 'r

Figure 4. Decoupled I3C MAS NMR of the partially calcined nano TS-l.

The decoupled l3C MAS NMR spectrum of PC nano TS-l (Figure 4) exhibits three
resonances at ca. 11, 15.6 and 61 ppm, respectively, as expected for intact TPA molecules. There
is a substantial line broadening, caused by strong dipolar interaction of the TPA with the
hydroxylated surface. The ""C MAS NMR spectra of TPA in micrometer size MFI crystals
exhibit a splitting of the 13C signal at 11 ppm (C3), which was attributed to the two possible
environments for the propyl groups in the straight and sinusoidal channels, respectively [10].
Due to the large linewidths, it is not possible to verify whether such line splitting is also present
in name T84 powder.

"7","EVALUATION OF CATALYTIC PERFORMANCES OF NANO TS~1
Hydroxylation of phenol and epoxidation of 1-hexene, using hydrogen peroxide as the l
oxidant, were carried out over the as-synth., PC and FC nano TS-l sample and compared with
conventional TS-l with a same Ti content as well as with a blank experiment without catalyst
(Table I).

: Asasynthesized and calcined nano TS-l were found to be inactive. PC nano TS-l is active in
; both reactions and the activity and selectivity were similar to that of conventional TS-l (and
‘I :F' I much higher than the blank experiments). It is concluded that the titanium sites responsible for
' L the catalytic activity become accessible when the template is removed ﬁ‘om the external surface
E a of‘ the particles. The location of the titanium in the shape selective environment of the pore
I mouths is conﬁrmed by the enhanced para selectivity in phenol hydroxylation (Tabte 1). The
hydroquinone selectivity of the PC nano TS-I approaches that of conventional TS-l.
A conventional TS-l crystal of 100 nm diameter contains in the order of 10“ titanium atoms
acting as potential catalytic sites. Nano TS-l is estimated to contain less than 10 Ti atoms per
. particle. It is improbable that the removal of the physisorbed TPAOH from the external surface
would render all Ti sites catalytically active, as the micropores remain occupied with TPA.
Assuming an even distribution of the Ti atoms over the nano particles, it is estimated that only
about one third of Ti atoms are accessible and catalytically active. Given the comparable
activities of PC-nano and the conventional TS-l samples, the catalytic turnovers per accessible
Ti atom in PC-nano TS-l are much higher compared to the conventional TS-l. Many reactions
catalyzed by zeolite crystals including TS—l suffer from diffusional limitations [11], particularly
1830 :

more efﬁcient utilization of zeolite mass.

A competitive epoxidation exp eriment of l~hexene and cyclohexene was performed over PC
nano TS-l and compared with conventional TS—l (T able 2). The higher reactivity of l—hexene
compared to cyclohexene over TS-l is due to reagent shape selectivity and the much more
difﬁcult penetration into the micropores for cyclohexene compared to 1~hexene.

Despite the higher activity of the conventional TS-l compared to nano TS-l under these
conditions, the ratio of the yields of the two epoxides are very similar over both catalyst samples,
suggesting the existence of a same shape-selective effect.

CONCLUSIONS

Nano Sil-l and nano TS-l with particle size of 2 to 3 am can be isolated from solution and
handled as a powder. These samples exhibit the IR spectrum of MFI frameworks including the
characteristic band at 550-590 cm"". About two thirds of the TPA is occluded in the pores, one
third is adsorbed on the extema] surface of the particles. Attempts to remove occluded TPA by
calcination and irradiation with UV lead to structural collapse. Part of the titanium atoms located
in the pore mouths of nano TS-I can be rendered catalytically active by evacuating the TPAOH

. molecules from the external surfaces of the particles by gentle calcination at 503 K. Removal of
all TPA is eXpected to result in a superior partial oxidation catalyst, provided the structure can be
preserved.
