Background Back pain and intervertbral disc (IVD) damage are
common problems experienced by astronauts. We hypothesize
this is from paraspinal muscle deconditioning, ~5 cm body
lengthening from spinal swelling and straightening, and
biochemical tissue changes.
Objective Examine morphological changes in the lumbar spine
induced by spaceﬂight.
Design Prospective, case series clinical study.
Setting We studied crewmembers from the National
Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA).
Participants Recruitment from International Space Station
NASA/European Space Agency/Canadian Space Agency crew-
members, starting 2011. We enrolled 8 NASA crewmembers.
One crewmember completed the study. The others are in
various stages of testing.
Risk factors Assessment Crew members were studied before
and after a ~18O day mission in the International Space Station.
Main outcome measurements In pre-ﬂight and post-ﬂight

studies of the lumbar spine, evaluate: 1) degenerative
changes using MRI, 2) compressibility using an upright MRI
backpack loading protocol, 3) spinal kinematics with X—ray Vide-
ography, 4) Visual analog scale pain.
Results Comparing pre-ﬂight and post- ﬂight data, there
were 1) increased lumbar IVD heights in the supine
position, 2) increased lumbar IVD compressibility in the upright
position, 3) decreased ﬂexibility, and 4) increased low back pain
post-ﬂight.
Conclusions The data support the idea that decreased gravita-
tional forces on the IVDS, during prolonged microgravity,
increases their water content but decreases proteoglycan. This
increases disk degeneration risk on Earth. We have a sample size
of one for complete Pre- and Post-Flight testing. It’s difﬁcult to
make conclusions with this preliminary data. However, the
acquired images are very high quality and provide conﬁdence
for future tests. The next crewmember returns to Earth for ﬁnal
testing November, 2013. Testing of 4 crewmembers and
ongoing recruitment are underway.
