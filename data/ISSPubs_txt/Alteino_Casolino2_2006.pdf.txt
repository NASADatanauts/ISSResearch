Abstract
The experiment Sileye—3/Alteino was ﬁrst operational on board the International Space Station between 27/4 and 1/5/2002. It is con—
stituted of a cosmic ray silicon detector and an electroencephalograph and is used to monitor radiation environment and study the light
ﬂash phenomenon in space. As a stand—alone device, Sileye—3/Alteino can monitor in real time cosmic ray nuclei. In this work, we report
on relative nuclear abundance measurements in different regions of the orbit for nuclei from B to Fe in the energy range above =60 MeV/
n. Abundances of nuclei such as O and Ne relative to C are found to be increased in respect to particle composition outside of the station,
whereas the Fe group is reduced. This effect could be ascribed to nuclear interactions with the hull of the station.
