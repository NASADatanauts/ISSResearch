Abstract
Although bioﬁlm formation is widely documented on Earth, it has not been demonstrated in the absence of graVity. To explore this
possibility, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, suspended in sterile buffer, was ﬂown in a commercial payload on space shuttle ﬂight STS-95. During
earth orbit, biofilm formation was induced by exposing the bacteria to sterile media through a 0.2-11m (pore size) polycarbonate membrane.
Examination of these membranes by confocal microscopy revealed biofilms to be present and that these biofilms could persist in spite of
Vigorous agitation. These results represent the first report of biofilm formation under microgravity conditions. © 2001 Federation of
