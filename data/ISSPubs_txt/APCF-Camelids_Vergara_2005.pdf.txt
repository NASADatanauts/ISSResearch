Abstract
The crystallographic quality of protein crystals that were grown in microgravity has been compared to that of crystals that were grown in
parallel on earth gravity under otherwise identical conditions. A goal of this comparison was to assess if a more accurate 3D-structure can be
derived from crystallographic analysis of the former crystals. Therefore, the properties of crystals prepared with the Advanced Protein
Crystallisation Facility (APCF) on earth and in orbit during the last decade were evaluated. A statistical analysis reveals that about half of the
crystals produced under microgravity had a superior X-ray diffraction limit with respect of terrestn'al controls. Eleven protein structures could
be determined at previously unachieved resolutions using crystals obtained in the APCF. Microgravity induced features of the most relevant
structures are reported. A second goal of this study was to identify the cause of the crystal quality enhancement useful for structure
determination. No correlations between the effect of microgravity and other system—dependent parameters, such as isoelectric point or crystal
solvent content, were found except the reduced convection during the crystallisation process. Thus, crystal growth under diffusive regime
appears to be the key parameter explaining the beneﬁcial effect of microgravity on crystal quality. The mimicry of these effects on earth in
gels or in capillary tubes is discussed and the practical consequences for structural biology highlighted.
