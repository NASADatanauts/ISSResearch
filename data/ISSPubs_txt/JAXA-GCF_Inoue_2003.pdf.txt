E Here we report the crystal structures of human hematopoietic prostaglandin (PG) D synthase bound to
«3 glutathione (GSH) and Ca2+ or Mg“. Using GSH as a cofactor, prostaglandin D synthase catalyzes the isomerization
E of PGHZ to PGDZ, a mediator for allergy response. The enzyme is a homodimer, and Ca2+ or Mgz+ increases its
E activity to ~150% of the basal level, with half maximum effective concentrations of 400 pLM for Ca2+ and 50 pLM
3 for Mg“. In the MgZ+-bound form, the ion is octahedrally coordinated by six water molecules at the dimer
§ interface. The water molecules are surrounded by pairs of Asp93, Asp96 and Asp97 from each subunit. Ca2+ is
E coordinated by five water molecules and an Asp96 from one subunit. The Asp96 residue in the Ca2+-bound form
g makes hydrogen bonds with two guanidium nitrogen atoms of Arg14 in the GSH-binding pocket. Mgz+ alters the
E coordinating water structure and reduces one hydrogen bond between Asp96 and Arg14, thereby changing the
'3; interaction between Arg14 and GSH. This effect explains a four—fold reduction in the Km of the enzyme for GSH.
E The structure provides insights into how Ca2+ or Mgz+ binding activates human hematopoietic PGD synthase.
