Abstract
Two hypotheses have been invoked so far to explain performance decrements in space: the microgravity hypothesis and the
multiple stressors hypothesis. Furthermore, previous investigations of cognitive performance did not speciﬁcally target executive
functions. The aim of this study was to investigate the impact of Operational stress on cognitive control, towards both neutral and
emotionally loaded material, using both psychometric and physiological indicators (autonomic nervous system activity computed
through cardiO-respiratory recordings). We applied the same design in a study on student pilots (N = 12) in baseline conditions
and right before a major evaluation ﬂight and on astronauts (N = 3) before, during and after a short—duration spaceﬂight. To
address the problem of scarcity of subjects, we applied analytical methods derived from neuropsychology: comparing each
astronaut treated as a single subject to a group of carefully matched controls (N = 13). Results from both student pilots and
astronauts showed that Operational stress resulted in failing cognitive control, especially on emotionally loaded material that was
relevant to the subjects’ current concern. This impaired cognitive control was associated with a decreased physiological reactivity
during mental tasks. Furthermore, for astronauts, this performance decrement appeared on the last data-collection before launch
and lasted for the two in-ﬂight measurements. These results thus allow us to conclude that: (i) performance testing including an
emotional dimension seems more sensitive to Operational stress, (ii) decreased heart rate reactivity was associated with impaired
cognitive control and (iii) microgravity is not the sole causal factor of potential performance decrements in space, which are
more likely due to the combination of multiple stressors.
