Abstract . . g ‘
Plant grow1h in limited volumes of porous substrates is of interest for advanced life A
support systems for NASA’s ﬁature space missions Liquid behavior under
microgravity introduces special considerations for selection of suitable porous plant
growth media and the design of root modules for reliable water, air,.and nutrient
supply. It has recently become evident that the macroscOpic dynamic behavior ‘of the
temporal and spatial under-saturation levels in root modules strongly depends on the
physical behavior of the ﬂuid at the microscopic (pore-scale) level. ”Ultimately,
stability and break-up of liquid-bﬁdges, —columns, and -ﬁlms, confounded by,
contact angle dynamics and hysteresis, phase discontinuities, capillary ﬁngering and
entrepment of the non-wetting phase together with dynamic rearrangement of solid
pameles and the complex geometry of porous media determine the saturation levels
and 1ts stability at macroscopic scales However, it is not yet clear if and to‘what

Introduction
A basic understanding of behavior and distribution of liquids in plant growth porous
media under microgravity is essential for the design of advanced life support
systems, part of NASA’s vision for future space travel. Previous plant growth
experiments during Space ﬂight revealed difﬁculties with water, nutrient, and air
supply to plant roots (Steinberg et al., 2002). These limitations were attxibuted to
design flaws due to limited understanding of liquid behavior and conﬁguration in
Particulate porous media under reduced gravity. Microgravity could affect pore-scale
liquid organization by enhancing phase entrapment and changing interfacial
Conﬁgurations (J ones and Or, 1999). Such effects must be considered in the choice
of plant growth media and the design of root modules. Evidence suggests that
macroscopic quantities such as gaseous diffusion and hydraulic conductivity are
Strongly affected by ﬂuid behavior at the pore-scale. Some of these effects have been
observed in parabolic ﬂight on NASA’s KC-135 aircraft and on the International
, Space Station (188). Here we employ the Augmented Young-Laplace AYL equation
» to simultaneously consider contributions of capillary and adsorptive forces (1- g and
0-g) to calculate liquid conﬁgurations in angular pores as a ﬁmction of chemical
potential.
T heoretical

\ Vapor interface in angular corners is calculated according to Philip's (1977) solution
for slit-shaped gaps capitalizing on symmetiy. The equilibrium liquid-vapor interface

Figure 1 illustrates the difference between 1— and O-g conditions for the basic parallel
plate solution. The calculations indicate that the effect of gravity becomes signiﬁcant
for mm-sized pores and for porous media matn'c potentials near zero. This is
approximately in the range of pore sizes used for porous plant growth media having
particles sizes from 0.5 up to 2 mm in diameter (Steinberg et a1., 2002). ,

decreasing potential.
Air entrapment and development of locally immobile ﬂuid clusters is an important
aspect affecting ﬂuid conﬁguration in reduced gravity that may lead to Water and
nutnent stress in plants. Spontaneous displacement of liquid at certain critical ;
potentlals due to pore snap-off (Fig. 3) and particle rearrangement and separation
due to wettmg front advance and recess [J ones and Or,.1999] are potential '
mechamsms for an entrapment and formation of extended ganglia. Relationships
between pore-space geometry, pore-size distribution, matric potential and phase
patterns (hquld and gaseous) for reduced gravity need to be developed based on
vxsual and tensmmetmc measurements in various geometries under microgravity
condltlons.

Indications of the interplay between capillary and gravitations forces on liquid phase
organization can be expressed by the bond number. The relationships (eq. 6) for both
earth’s gravity (l—g) and microgravity (0.001—g) are plotted as a ﬁmction of pore
radius in Figure 4. The microgravity forces associated with both the KC-135 ﬂight
and the 183 are due to body forces and micro-accelerations from motors and'other
mechanical devices and true O—g is rare experience. However, even at 0.001-g, the
differences in ﬂuid—phase behavior become signiﬁcant compared to l-g. Evidence
suggests that for B>0.05 water ﬂow under 1g becomes unstable. This condition
corresponds to water ﬂow in pores with a radius larger than 0.6 mm. For smaller
pores and for lower ambient matric potentials, the shape of liquid vapor interface
with and without gravity are indistinguishable.

to complete sample saturation that only occurred for the largest particles. Preferential

of water was a function of pore-size and ﬂow direction relative to the gravitational

occurs at a smaller pore radius than expected based on a bond number of 1 (Fig. 4) - a _
where theoretically, gravitational and capillary forces are similar for a pore radius of
0.14 cm. Horizontal and vertical ﬂow scenarios at l-g fonn an envelope around the
pore volume pumped in O-g suggesting earth-based measurements may provide

The inﬂuence of zero gravity if further illustrated in Fig. 6 Where the top sequence
shows water “pumping” in the absence of gravity and restoration of the interfaces
with gravitational force. A suspended liquid cluster (pinned by capillary forces —1eft
bottom) falls down with the onset of gravity. Subsequent injection of additional
liquid clusters exhibit preferential ﬂow within the exact same pn'med pathways, in
more complex wetting patterns can lead to gas entrapment between adj acent wetted
pathways.
Conclusions
Calculations based on the Augmented Young-Laplace equation reveal that for all
practical purposes, the effect of gravity on interfacial conﬁguration at the single pore
scale is relatively small and may be negligible for porous media with pore sizes less
that ~ 1 mm. The impact of gravity is more signiﬁcant at the intermediate scale of
several pores (or liquid cluster). Such processes give rise to phase entrapment (either
liquid entrapment — Fig. 3), or gas entrapment and reduced overall wetting of the
porous medium. Quantiﬁcation of these processes is being pursued by observations
of micromodels aboard KC~135 ﬂight experiments, and theoretically using the
Lattice Boltzmann method.
