Radiation measurements of surface and deep organ doses were performed aboard the International Space Station, for the
period of January 2006 to April 200?, using a MOSFET desimetry system eemhined with the Matmshka-R spherical
phantom. The averaged internal and surface dose rates are found to be 0.19 and 0.29:1](33' 11—1., respectively. The levels of
radiation dose to hleed-ferming organs (BFO) and to surface organs are tempered with recommended safe limits. The
maximum measured BFO dose has an as'erage dose rate of 0.23 [IIGFIi—l (84 mGy y—i), eerrespending to 44 % ef the ree-
emmended annual limit ef0.5 St, for a space radiation quality fatter of 2.6. The annual surface dose is found to be higher at
126 [110}; eerrespending to 16 '5’:- of the eye dese limit and to 11 '5’:- of the skin dese limit. Doses calculated using the Spenvis
software showed deviations of up to 3'7 % from measurements.
