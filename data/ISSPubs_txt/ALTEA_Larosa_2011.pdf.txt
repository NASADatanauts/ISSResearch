Abstract
Solar Particle Events (SPEs) are a major concern during prolonged space
missions. During such events, a large amount of light ions, mostly protons and
helium nuclei, are accelerated With enough energy to traverse the spacecraft
hull and therefore represent a high hazard for the crews’ health. The ALTEA
particle telescope was collecting continuous data inside the USLab module of
the International Space Station (188) during most of the December 2006 SPEs.
The telescope is able to measure protons and helium respectively in the 42—
45 MeV and 42—250 MeV/nucleon energy ranges, heavier ions up to relativistic
molybdenum, and to discriminate nuclei for Z 2 5. First measurements of the
Charged radiation environment inside the USLab during a SPE are presented.
The data averaged over the entire SPE week show an increase of the light ion
rate (about a factor 1.5 in the energy range of the detector) When compared
to quiet Sun conditions. The increase becomes much higher during the SPE
climax (13 December) reaching a factor 10 (when averaged over three 188
orbits showing the highest activity). The extension of these results beyond the
detector range is discussed. Conversely, the rates of ions With Z 2 5 are shown
not to Change signiﬁcantly during the SPE week.
1. Introduction
Radiation hazards are of highest concern When planning long human presence in space for the
future exploration, 0n the Moon, Mars and beyond, but also during prolonged presence in the

Space radiation is composed of high—energy ions, with a dominant component in quiet
Sun condition consisting of 99% H and He ions and 1% heaVier nuclei, along with particles
accelerated during explosive solar events such as solar particle event (SPE). A SPE can be
caused by a coronal mass ejection or by a solar ﬂare. The former is an eruption of plasma
of the enclosed magnetic ﬁeld from the solar corona into the interplanetary space and is
potentially more dangerous than a solar ﬂare. The latter is a Violent eXplosion in the Sun’s
atmosphere with an energy emission up to 1025 J that seems to happen when energy stored
in twisted magnetic ﬁelds, usually above sunspots, is suddenly released. Solar ﬂare events
take place in the solar corona and chromospheres and are probably primarily due to magnetic
reconnection mechanisms. They heat plasma to tens of millions degrees and accelerate the
resulting electrons, protons and heaVier ions to near the speed of light.

The rate and nature of radiation play an important role in the quantiﬁcation of the health
risks related to the exposure of humans to the space radiation environment [2]. A SPE may
produce a sufﬁcient amount of radiation to increase the risk well above acceptable thresholds
during space voyages outside the protective shielding provided by the Earth’s geomagnetic
ﬁeld [3, 4]. The dominant contribution is primarily protons, and we expect to observe inside
the 188 an increase of light ion components, while the heavy ion radiation environment is not
expected to Change signiﬁcantly.

The ALTEA facility has been placed in the USLab since July 2006, and it has been
operative almost continuously from August 2006 to J uly 2007 and from J une 2009 to present.
The device, which is the development of our previous detectors [5 , 6], was designed in the
framework of the ALTEA program [7] which aims at monitoring the radiation environment
inside the ISS and investigating its effects on the brain function of the astronauts. We present
here a Characterization of the radiation environment inside the ISS (USLab) during the SPEs
occurred between 5 and 14 December 2006. A comparison with analogous measurements
during quiet Sun conditions is also shown.

2. Methods

The ALTEA—Space particle detector is composed of siX identical telescopes (silicon detector
Units, SDUs), arranged on a helmet—shaped holder4. Every SDU consists of three couples of
parallel detector planes; each plane consists of two (striped square) silicon Chips with a size
of 8 cm X 8 cm and a thickness of 380 ,urn. Every silicon plane is diVided into 32 strips
with 2.5 mm pitch and alternatively oriented along the X and Y directions (see ﬁgure 1). The
energy resolution of the detector ranges from a threshold of 3 to 800 keV ,um‘l (linear energy
transfer (LET) in Si).

Each SDU can discriminate particle trajectory and the corresponding energy deposition
with a threshold selectable from 0.9 to 3 keV ,um‘l (in silicon) [8, 9]. During the presented
measurements, the threshold was set at 3 keV ,um‘l. The particle rate is obtained considering
the events that traverse at least ﬁve of the siX planes. The distribution of the energy deposited
on each detector plane by each ion is measured taking into account pedestal subtraction and
normalization to the vertical direction (for details, see [10]). Here, we present the particle
rate and the energy deposition spectrum from SDUl, which is the telescope that was operative
over the entire time frame considered. This telescope was oriented along the transversal
aXis of the USLab module, thus facing a direction with the lowest amount of shielding,
measured to be equivalent to 5 cm Al [11, 12]. The analysis was performed only on ‘fast
4 This structure has been chosen to perform also measurements of the radiation impinging on the astronauts’ head;
in this case the astronaut would position his / her head inside the helmet—shaped detector [7].

particle’ events, i.e. events whose energy loss difference between the ﬁrst and the last couple
of silicon planes was less than 10%. This ﬁlter is needed to use the ion recognition algorithm
described below and, taking also into account the 3 keV ,um‘l threshold, selects protons with
energy of approximately 42—45 MeV and heavier ions up to Fe with energy greater than 187
MeV/nucleon5 [10]. The contribution of each ion type, with Z 2 5, has been calculated from
the energy spectrum with a multiple Landau ﬁt [10], using a software developed within the
Minuit framework of the (CERN) ROOT software package [13]. This package provides three
output parameters for each peak, namely amplitude, most probable energy value and width
(standard deviation). We ﬁtted the measured spectrum with the sum of several Landau curves,
each ﬁtting single nuclear species. The Landau ﬁt is therefore given by
00
f(k) = 190/ u_”e_”(x_p1)p2 sin(7w) du,
0
where A is a dimensionless variable, [90 is proportional to the height of the single nuclear
peak, 191 is proportional to the most probable energy value of each peak in the spectrum
and 192 is related to the standard deviation of the peak. This ﬁtting method features quite
good agreement with the ALTEA data [10]. We also tested the method with a Monte Carlo
simulation demonstrating good agreement between simulated and experimental data.

The ALTEA SPE rates of the nuclear species from B up to Si and Fe have been obtained
dividing each ion abundance by the effective operation time (the dead time of the instrument
has also been considered). In order to assess the SPE contribution over the galactic radiation
environment, we compared the rates measured during the SPE with those measured during a
reference week (2—8 November 2006), Characterized by quiet Sun conditions. To assess the
inﬂuence of light ions (Z < 5) on the energy spectrum, the SPE rates for heavy ions (Z 2 5)
have been obtained by ﬁxing the most probable energy value and the standard deviation of B
(Z = 5) and C (Z = 6) peaks to the values obtained from the analysis of the reference week
and leaving as free parameter only the peak amplitude.

5 This correspondence does not take into account straggling. We expect to select with this ﬁlter a smaller subset of
these ions, as in many cases the straggling effect would make the ions not meeting the selection criteria.

The climax of the SPE (maximum recorded particle rate) was reached during three 188
orbits on 13 December. Because of the short time of observation when focusing on these three
orbits, the statistics of heaVier ions (i.e. C, N, O and Fe) was too low to allow the analysis of
the spectrum with the Landau ﬁt method. In this case, the rate estimates were obtained using
a different data analysis technique [14], based on the comparison of the energy loss spectrum
with a reference spectrum (the one relative to the time interval August 2006—July 2007) on
which it was possible to apply the standard multiple—Landau ﬁt analysis. The number of
particles of a given Z in an energy bin is proportional to the ratio for that Z and that energy bin
between the Landau curve and the total ﬁtting function calculated on the reference spectrum.
This method was validated on simulated data and proved ion recognition accuracy better than
1 sigma.

The uncertainties on the rates have been evaluated takin g into account the statistical errors
from the ﬁt parameters and the corrections related to the ALTEA apparatus (instrumental
efﬁciency and packet loss).

3. Results

The December 2006 SPEs occurred between 6 and 14 originated from the active region NOAA
10930. The 6 December event originated at the East limb, resulting in a gradual proton event
reaching the Earth on 7 December and lasting until the events of 13 and 14 December. On
13 December at 0238 UT, an X3.4 / 4B solar ﬂare occurred in the same active region NOAA
10930 (SO6W23). The intensities of the events were unusual for a solar minimum condition,
because of the poor magnetic connection of the interplanetary ﬁeld lines.

Figure 2 shows the plot of the fast particle rate from SDU1, recorded for the period
7—14 December 2006 (ALTEA was turned off before 7 December and after 12 pm of
14 December). The comparison with the (>50 MeV) proton ﬁuX measured by the GOES—
11 satellite [15] shows the good time coincidence of the events recorded with the two
instruments.

The ALTEA particle rate as a function of time depends on the modulation due to the
geomagnetic ﬁeld on the particle trajectories. The faster oscillation, with a period of about
45 min, is due to the latitude effect (reﬂecting the highest geomagnetic cutoff value in
the equatorial region, allowing only the high—energy ions to penetrate). The larger period
oscillation, with a period of almost 24 h, depends on the longitude of crossing the cutoff
regions and is due to the inclination of the geomagnetic dipole aXis with respect to the Earth’s
rotation aXis. The highest isolated peaks in the particle rate in ﬁgure 2 represent the passages of
the 188 over the South Atlantic Anomaly (SAA), the region out of the Brazil coast Characterized
by trapped proton rate inside the Van Allen Belt. The SPE effects can ﬁnally be identiﬁed in
the unusually high rate peaks of ﬁgure 2, happening for example on 7 and 13 December.

Figure 3 shows the energy loss distribution of the particles triggering the detector during
the whole SPEs (same period of ﬁgure 2). Distinguishable peaks are those up to Si. Also
the Fe peak is Clearly Visible, while the others are just slightly pronounced. In the inset the
zoomed spectrum ﬁtted with a sum of Landau curves up to the silicon peak is shown.

The leftmost peak in ﬁgure 3 is due to protons and helium (more than 99%), as well as
about 1% of lithium and beryllium nuclei that ALTEA is not able to resolve. The tail of this
peak distribution gives a contribution to elements up to Z = 18. The inﬂuence of this tail on
the boron peak is most eVident in ﬁgure 4, where a comparison between the deposited energy
spectra during the SPE and the reference quiescent week is displayed up to oxygen.

The largest event occurred on 13 December (ﬁgure 2). T0 detail the radiation monitoring
during this more intense activity, we followed the particle rate over each single orbit, in order
to average the effect of the geomagnetic cutoff in a consistent way. Figure 6 represents the rate
for light ions (Z < 5), as a function of the 13 December ISS orbits. Each orbit corresponds to a
revolution period of about 91 min. The SPE strongest effect was detected in the time interval
ranging from the third to the ﬁfth orbit (i.e. from 03:03: 16 amUT t0 07:38:09 amUT, the start
time being 13 December at 00:00 amUT).

To investigate Whether the SPE had a signiﬁcant effect on the radiation ﬁeld, the
ratio between the rate during the SPE climax (three orbits With the maximum activity on
13 December) and the rate during the quiescent Sun week has been estimated for several ion
types. The results are reported in ﬁgure 7, for light ions (Z < 5), for the complex C—N—O and
for Fe. If averaged only during passages of the 188 over the polar regions, the relative ﬂuX for
Z < 5 is >>10.

inside the ISS—USLab during a SPE, discriminating the nuclear species from B to Fe.

Figure 7. Rate of light ions (Z < 5), C—N—O group and Fe during the three (188) orbits (13
December) of the SPE maximum activity, normalized to the values of the reference week.

The highest rates (7 and 13 December) are synchronous With the (>50 MeV) proton
rate that increases as measured by the GOES—ll satellite—the missing part of the peak rate
between 7 and 8 December is related to the geomagnetic cutoff. The days from 9 December to
12 December do not show instead any deviation from solar quiet condition. All spectra show,
as expected, even Z nuclei more abundant than odd ones [10].

The inﬂuence of the H—Be peak on the adjacent B peak is most noticeable in ﬁgure 4
Where the two spectra can be almost superimposed from carbon to oxygen, While they differ
for the lighter ions. This effect is the reason for ﬁxing the Width and most probable value
of the B and C peak parameters to those measured in the quiet Sun period (only the amplitude
of the peaks are left free, see section 2). In this way, the contamination of the light ions’ peak
in the analysis of heaVier ions is minimized.

Although the ALTEA detector has a narrow acceptance Window for protons (from 42 to
45 MeV), we have proved that the SPE produces, as expected, a strong increase in the rate
of the light ions (Z < 5, but essentially protons and helium nuclei) With respect to the values
recorded during the quiescent period. This trend is evident in the rate averaged over the Whole
SPE week (see ﬁgure 5), Where an increase of about 50% is observed and becomes much more
relevant during the three orbits With the strongest solar activity (ﬁgure 7) When, averaging over
each orbit, it increases by about a factor of 10. This ratio represents a lower limit of the SPE
contribution to the proton rate due to the limited acceptance Window for this particle species.
It should also be remarked that the ratio refers to a value averaged over full orbits, including
the equatorial regions Where, due to the high geomagnetic cutoff, the low—Z low—energy SPE
radiation cannot penetrate. During the passages over the polar regions, Characterized by a
much lower geomagnetic cutoff, our measured ratio is >>10.

By contrast, and as expected, there is no signiﬁcant increase of the heavy ion component,
as selected by our ‘fast particle’ ﬁlter (see section 2), neither in the averaged rate (ﬁgure 5)
nor during the hours with the strongest solar activity (ﬁgure 7). The slight increase of
CNO with respect to the reference week is most likely due to the contribution of lower—
Z ions, which is minimized but not cancelled by the procedure described in section 2.
It should also be noted that the Fe rate might not be accurate due to low statistics: the
relative rate is based only on two ions detected during the three orbits of maximum activity,
against an average of 1.5 :l: 1.1 ion/orbit detected during the reference week in November
2006.

As mentioned, the results show the ﬁrst nuclear discriminated measurements of the
charged radiation inside a space vessel during a solar ﬂare. These are of interest in the frame
of radiation risk assessment. As far as heavy ions are concerned (Z 2 5), the measurements are
compatible with an unchanged radiation environment with respect to quiescent Sun conditions
(see the introduction).

For the light ions (Z < 5, but mostly protons and, in a lesser extent, helium), we have the
narrow energy acceptance window for protons. To fully eXploit the radiation protection value
of these results, the proton spectral components that cannot be measured by ALTEA should
be reconstructed. This problem can be approached using an algorithm based on independent
proton measurements, such as the ones obtained with the Pamela spectrometer [16, 17],
during the SPE and quiescent solar periods, in LEO at a comparable geomagnetic cutoff. This
reconstruction algorithm should also rely on a suitable code for the transport in the 188, so as
to match our measurement inside, within our energy window. This work just started and will
be the object of a future paper.

Nevertheless, these results indicate that a SPE affects signiﬁcantly the LET in the ISS
producing a substantial increase of low—LET radiation rate which reaches the highest values
in quite short periods, conﬁrming the need to consider the SPE in those biological processes
for which radiation rate plays an important role.

5. Conclusions
In this work, we have shown the charged radiation rates obtained with the ALTEA detector on
board of the 188 during the solar particle events of December 2006 and compared them with
analogous measurements during quiet Sun conditions. These results provide ﬁrst information
for charged radiation risk assessment in space habitats during a SPE. The SPE produces, as
expected, an increase of the light ion (Z < 5) rate with respect to the values recorded during
the quiescent times. In our limited acceptance window for proton, the mean measured rate
over the whole SPE week is 1.5 times greater than the rate during the quiescent condition, but
the ratio rises to about 10 (lower limit) when averaged over the solar most active period (three
188 orbits). By contrast, the abundance of heaVier nuclei results unchanged within the errors
with respect to quiet Sun conditions.
