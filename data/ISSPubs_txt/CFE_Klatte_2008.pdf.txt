Abstract The surface evolver (SE) algorithm is a valued numerical tool for computations of complex
equilibrium interfacial phenomena. In this work, an iterative procedure is implemented such that SE can
be employed to predict steady—state ﬂows along capillary channels of arbitrary cross~secti0n. As a demonstra—
tion, a 0ne-dimensi0nal stream ﬁlament ﬂow model is solved that approximates the pressure Changes inside
the channel. Despite its simplicity, the precision, stability, and speed of the method afﬁrm it as an efﬁcient and
unique design tool for a variety of capillary ﬂow problems. The procedure is ideally suited for slender column
ﬂows such as open wedge Channel ﬂows, several of which are validated herein Via parabolic ﬂight and drop
tower experiments.

, and time—dependent Stokes solvers [4]. Exact analytic approaches for free surface ﬂows in groeve and wedge
geometries exist [5, 8], but are limited herein to the viscous—dominated regime.

The proposed numerical procedure is demonstrated for liquid ﬂows inside wedge and rectangular groove
open capillary Channels, where analytical and experimental data are available for comparison. As will be seen,
interface proﬁles, ﬂow rates, and ﬂow rate limits compare well with the experimental data.

2 Medet
A laminar, isothermal, incompressible, and Newtonian liquid ﬂow through an open wedge-shaped channel is
sketched in Fig. 1. A passive overlying gas is assumed such that stresses at the interface may be neglected.
The liquid—gas interface is represented with a moving ﬁnite element grid, and precise contact angle 01‘ pinning
conditions can be deﬁned at the interface boundaries. The liquid pressure p(x) is approximated using the 1-D
stream ﬁlament theory along the x-axis, where

Employing a mass balance, the convective term with density ,0 appears in Eq. (1) as a function of the constant
“ ﬂow rate Q and eross—seetional area A. Constant pressure throughout each cross~seetion is assumed. The
constant C is deﬁned by the pressure difference to the overlying gas phase, but is insigniﬁcant if the liquid
volume of the system is constant. The additional friction factor pf,

a see in T able 1, numerical integrations of Poisson’s equation are used to determine the pressure loss coefﬁcient
Kg. The friction model assumes a fully developed velocity proﬁle at each cross—section and neglects transition
losses [8—10]. As long as the ﬂuid pressure p(x) can be evaluated from the interface position, one is free to
extend or modify the pressure model t0 suit.

In SE, the pressure p(x) or any other quantity must be implemented as an energy integral over the liquid

boundaries S , e.g., the surface tension 0 is applied as a surface energy E, 2 MS ordS. With the deﬁnition

3 Appiieatieiis and vaiidetieh '
It is necessary to validate the numerical model and show its generality for capillary systems. In the f0110wing, the
model is first compared to analytical results for capillary wedge ﬂows for different wedge angles. Comparisons
are then made to reduced—g and terrestrial experimental data for both wedge and rectangular groove eapi11ai‘y
channels. The example ﬂows selected demonstrate the capability of the model to study systems with ﬁxed
or variable controi volume V for different eross—seetions and different inlet and outlet contact 1ine boundary
- conditions.
. 3.1 Analytical comparison
The model is ﬁrst used to examine viscous-dominated capillary wedge channels ﬂows for which anaiyticai
solutions are in hand [8]. The good agreement within the limit of the viscous analytic solution (Re < 90) in
Fig. 2 and Table 2 provides a degree of validation of the SE model. Additional computations for greater wedge
angles 01 (R e > 90) are performed to identify the limit of the viseous—analytic model and the inﬂuence of inertia.
The SE model captures this presence of increased inertia in the ﬂow and identiﬁes the limits of applicability
of the viscous solution. This point is clariﬁed by review of Table 2, where quantitative comparisons are made.
As expected, deﬂection differences between the analytic versus numeric surface predictions increase with R e.
In this approach the liquid volume V is ﬁxed and independent of gas pressure pa. Thus, the constant C of
Eq. (1) has no bearing on the solution. At the inlet and outlet, the contact line is free to move with a defined
contact angle known from the analytical selution for capillary driven ﬂow.
32 Viscous—dominated capillary ﬂows: wedge
, In Fig. 3, the SE model is compared to experimental data from M. M. Weislogel. Two plots are shown in
the ﬁgure to demonstrate the accuracy of the method. The ﬁrst comparison is performed in a reduced gravity
environment(parab01ic ﬂight) with a constant ﬂow rate of 0.0 1 9 m1/s, Fig. 3 (lower left). The second comparison
plot is selected for a terrestrial experiment with a ﬂow rate of 0.039 ml/s, Fig. 3 (lower right). Good agreement
is obtained for both the environments with errors less than 2% (note the exaggerated scales). Experimental
uncertainty 0f i2 px is shewn using dashed lines on the ﬁgure.

The experiments employ an apparatus that strives to maintain constant pressure at the ehahheT inlet allowing
the hquici volume V at the test section to vary. Nevertheless, the constant C of Eq. (1) is well—deﬁned by the
