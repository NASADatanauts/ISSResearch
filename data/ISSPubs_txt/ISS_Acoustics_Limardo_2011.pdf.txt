The International Space Station (188) is a unique workplace environment for U.S.
astronauts and Russian cosmonauts to conduct research and live for a period of six months
or more. Noise has been an enduring environmental physical hazard that has been a
challenge for the U.S. space program since before the Apollo era. Noise exposure in [SS
poses signiﬁcant risks to the crewmembers, such as; hearing loss (temporary or permanent),
possible disruptions of crew sleep, interference With speech intelligibility and
communication, possible interference With crew task performance, and possible reduction in
alarm audibility. Acoustic measurements were made onboard ISS and compared to
requirements in order to assess the acoustic environment to Which the crewmembers are
exposed. The purpose of this paper is to describe in detail the noise exposure monitoring
program as well as an assessment of the acoustic dosimeter data collected to date. The
hardware currently being used for monitoring the noise exposure onboard 188 Will be
discussed. Acoustic data onboard 188 has been collected since the beginning of ISS
(Increment 1, November 2001). Noise exposure data analysis Will include acoustic dosimetry
logged data from crew-worn dosimeters during work and sleep periods and also ﬁxed-
location measurements from Increment 1 to present day. Noise exposure levels (8-, 16- and
24-hr), LEQ, Will also be provided and discussed in this paper. Future directions and
recommendations for the noise exposure monitoring program Will be highlighted. This
acoustic data is used to ensure a safe and healthy working and living environment for the
crewmembers onboard the ISS.

I. Introduction
THIS paper presents an overview of the noise exposure assessment strategy used for monitoring the
crewmembers onboard the International Space Station (188). The strategy includes crew monitoring data
collected from the work and sleep periods on 188. The 188 is an orbiting laboratory in low-earth-orbit that provides
a facility for conducting science research. Science research is conducted in several pressurized modules. These
include; the US Laboratory module, the European Space Agency’s Columbus module, the Japanese Experiment
module and the Russian’s Service Module. Besides laboratory modules, 188 also includes three other modules called

Russian On-Orbit Segments (ROS). Node 2 connects the US, European and J apanese laboratory modules as well as
berthing ports for docking. It also contains four sleeping crew quarters. The other two sleeping crew quarters are
located in the Russian Service Module. Node 3 is attached to the port side of Node 1 and houses the regenerative
life-support equipment which includes the ISS air revitalization, oxygen generation, and the water recovery systems.
Node 3 also accommodates one of the bathrooms for crew hygiene called the Waste and Hygiene Compartment
(WHC) and exercising equipment (treadmill and weight-lifting devices). The other bathroom and exercising
equipment is located in the Russian Service Module, see Fig. 1. The 188 facility is a large, complex spacecraft that

must be maintained by its crew onboard. Monitoring of the enVironment is accomplished by the crew, With all
technical support provided by ground personnel. The space station was ﬁrst occupied in November 2001. There
were a total of three crewmembers onboard 188 during the intial stages. Later, in October 2009, the permanent crew
onboard ISS increased from three to siX. The 188 crewmembers are rotated every four to siX months. The period of
time from the launch of the Soyuz Russian vehicle with the rotating ISS crewmembers to the undocking from the
station of the return vehicle of that same crew is called an ISS Increment.

These pressurized modules contain many pieces of equipment that generate noise. The noise exposure program
has been in existence since the ﬁrst 188 module was occupied. Noise exposure in 188 posed signiﬁcant risks to the
crewmembers, such as; hearing loss (temporary or permanent), possible disruptions of crew sleep, interference with
speech intelligibility and communication, possible interference with crew task performance, and possible reduction
in alarm audibility. Before we can discuss the details of the noise exposure data, we need to provide some
information with regards to the ISS acoustic emission requirements, hardware used onboard 18$ for noise
monitoring, and how we train the crew to conduct the noise monitoring on 188.

Acoustic monitoring measurements were made onboard the ISS in order to assess the acoustic environment to which
the crewmembers were exposed. This data was used to ensure a safe working and living environment for the crew as
well as determine when actions were required in order to reduce the noise onboard the ISS. These requirements are
documented in the Medical Operations Requirements Document2 (MORD), the Medical Requirements Integration
Document3 (MRID), the Generic Groundrules and Constraints Documer1t4’5 (GGR&C), the Increment Deﬁnitions
and Requirements Document6 (IDRD) and from the Noise Level Constraint ISS Flight Rule (J SC Flight Rule B13-
152),7 see table 1. If 24-hour crew-worn noise exposure levels (L A, 24) measured by the ISS acoustic dosimeters were
67 dBA or higher, then the crewmembers were required to wear approved hearing protection devices according to
the ISS Flight Rule. Table l was taken from J SC Flight Rules — Bl3-152, and was devised to prevent the crew from

developing hearing loss. Adherence to these guidelines should keep the sound energy levels to which the ear was
exposed at an acceptable level. NASA and the Johnson Space Center’s Acoustics Ofﬁce developed and
implemented acoustic requirements that must be met for hardware and payloads to be certiﬁed for spaceﬂight. This
was the ﬁrst step in the noise control process for the International Space Station.8 The acoustic requirements were
based on the US. Noise Criterion (NC) family of curves.9 The pressurized modules on ISS have an acoustic
requirement of NC-50. The non-integrated government furnished equipment (e.g. exercise equipment) and payload
racks within the modules must meet the NC-4O criterion. The total complement of payloads inside a given
pressurized module were required to meet the NC-48 criterion. All of these allocations were provided at the different
hardware levels in order to ensure a safe and healthy working and living environment for the crewmembers onboard
the ISS. Detailed information regarding the acoustic requirements and measured sound levels on ISS are
documented in Ref. 10 and 11.
111. Noise Monitoring Hardware/Crew Training
A. Monitoring Hardware
Acoustic dosimeters are instruments used to measure noise
exposure over extended periods of time. The instruments used on
orbit during ISS Increments 1-15 were the Ametek Mark I® Audio , *
Dosimeters, see Fig. 2. A total of three acoustic dosimeters were » .-
onboard ISS at all times. The Mark I series featured simple
pushbutton operation. Pressing a button sequentially displayed W
sampled data without disrupting the sampling process. Status —_
indicators allowed the user to see at a glance that the unit was “ff
operating or if the battery needed to be changed. The instruments ""
also included a large, easy-to-read display. A microphone on a m ‘
cable was also included allowing the microphone to be clipped to A ”w §§Jg
the crewmembers’ collar. The instrument conformed to SZA i ‘
accuracy requirements in ANSI Sl.4-l983, and IEC 60651. The ‘
dosimeters can either be worn or placed in a static location to
determine noise ex osure, and equivalent sound pressure level, in . . .

24-hours. The sessions were split into a 16-hour workday and an 8-hour sleep period. These values were then
combined mathematically into an equivalent 24-hour exposure level. The dosimeter also recorded other levels such
as Lmax, the loudest level the dosimeter was exposed to during the recording period. The batteries were changed
before each operation because they last 40 hours nominally. There was no mechanism in place to calibrate the
dosimeters once on-orbit. The dosimeters were sent to the vendor for calibration each year, and a similar approach

"4","was used for re—supply before they left the ground at launch minus seven months. The drawback of these dosimeters
was that they provided one only number per measurement session and required the crew to provide hand—tabulation
of data which then was called down to Mission Control by the crew. The data provided by this dosimeter was
difﬁcult to interpret because single events were unidentiﬁable.

During the summer of 2008, the Mark I audio dosimeter was replaced with a Quest NoisePro DLX—1® acoustic
dosimeter, see Fig. 3. This new acoustic dosimeter has many capabilities and features. The Quest NoisePro DLX—l

dosimeter is a battery powered (2—AA alkaline), programmable
I acoustic dosimeter using a backlit 128 X 64 pixel graphical
I ”‘7"". Liquid Crystal Display (LCD) and is programmable to measure
I L audio levels in three user selectable measurement ranges (40—1 10
I .I ' dB RMS, 70—140 dB RMS and 115—143 dB Peak). The dosimeter
. kw "" :- also has ﬁve frequency weighting proﬁles (RMS A, RMS C,
I v ‘ a Peak A, Peak C and Peak Z). The internal non—volatile memory

_ . .‘ allowed for a maximum of 40 hours of data storage.
The most useful new feature of this dosimeter is the “logging”
feature, where this dosimeter provides dBA values for each one—
I minute interval during the selected sampling period collecting
"" useful time—based information. Data can also be recalled on the

display or downloaded Via infrared serial interface.
This new dosimeter has many technical and operational
beneﬁts. The data—logging feature provides an accurate account

calibration life of two years set by the vendor. The newly
calibrated dosimeters are exchanged for those that have been in use since the last supplied ﬂight. The dosimeter was
supplied to 188 with a protective cover that protects the entire face of the dosimeter. This cover is attached to the
face of the acoustic dosimeter using hook and loop fasteners. Clear medical tape was also applied to the LCD screen
to aid in the containment of shatterable materials in the event the LCD screen was impacted. When the acoustic
dosimeter was mounted in a static location, the protective cover was secured to the face of the acoustic dosimeter
and the dosimeter was mounted with the hook and loop fasteners facing the wall to provide an additional level of

protection.

"5","The acoustic dosimeter was used to measure and monitor crew exposure to ambient noise as they performed
nominal activities and tasks throughout 188. This monitoring was also used to characterize the internal acoustic
environment of ISS, and to assist in the implementation of effective countermeasures to reduce or eliminate crew
exposure to high noise levels. As part of nominal on—orbit operations, the acoustic dosimeter ran for 48 hours
periods (24 for crew—worn and 24 for static locations). The acoustic dosirneter collected data that was then
transferred to the SSC. Before a second 48 hour increment had begun, the crew replaced the two AA alkaline
batteries in each of the acoustic dosimeters. The batteries required for operation were acquired from the 188 battery
pantry. Before the two year calibration life expired, three new acoustic dosirneters were supplied to 188. The
dosirneters were returned to ground on the Space Shuttle for refurbishment, but after the Shuttle retires they will be
disposed of and replaced with new dosirneters every two years. The acoustic dosirneters were calibrated and
functionally tested prior to and after ﬂight, when possible (if returned to ground). Once the pre—ﬂight calibration and
functional testing was completed, the batteries used in the test were removed and disposed of before ﬂight. No on—
orbit rnaintenance was required on the acoustic dosimeters. All rnaj or calibrations and maintenance activities done to
the acoustic dosirneters were completed on the ground.

B. Crew Training

Environmental monitoring was one of the key tasks required by all a \
crewrnember onboard 188 in order to ensure a healthy and safe § 7 i
environment. On—orbit crewtime was a high demand asset for all g . a ' 3kg: ~»
operational tasks. Many environmental monitoring tasks were very ‘ Q. ,3.” . ‘ ‘1‘ ; 'v’ :7

molded to each speciﬁc crewrneniber’s ear canal and provided to each
188 crewmember. The ﬁrst custom earplug included ﬁlters for lowering sound levels. A prime (25 dB ﬁlter) and a
spare (15 dB ﬂlter) custom earplug, for each crewrnernber, were sent to 188 at the same time.

The second type of custom earplug provided to the ISS crew was primarily used for performing on—orbit hearing
assessrnents. These custom earplugs were also used for attenuating arnbient sound levels (up to 37 dB).
Additionally, each crewmember was equipped with an active noise reduction headset. The ANR headset used on 188
was the Bose® Quiet Cornfort® 2 Headphone (cancels low frequency noise in bandwidths below 750 Hz). The
ANR headset can also be used as a passive hearing protection device. However, the prolonged use of hearing
protection devices could have health implications. Sorne crewmembers have reported discomfort, such as; constant
irritation in their ear canals or from the pressure from the headsets.15 The hearing protection devices were not

on 188.

IV. Data and Analysis
A. Acoustic Dosimetry

Acoustic dosimetry data were collected from crew-worn and static location measurements. The acoustic
dosimeter activity was divided into two days; (1) crew-worn measurements during the ﬁrst day and (2) static
measurements the following day. The frequency of these activities was monthly with static measurements
performed every other month. For the crew-worn activity, the crewmember donned the acoustic dosimeter and
started the measurement before breakfast during the day of the planned activity. The crew-worn session concluded
immediately before post sleep activities the following day. The crew-worn session included day time and sleep time
periods (24-hours).

For the static measurement session, the crewmember deployed the acoustic dosimeters in predetermined
locations (three) during the 2nd day of the acoustic dosimeter activity. The static locations included speciﬁc areas in
the modules or in the Vicinity of speciﬁc hardware (e.g. near the treadmill or fans) for conducting assessments and
evaluations. These locations were selected by the J ohnson Space Center’s (J SC) Acoustics Ofﬁce and were rotated
throughout 18$ for trending purposes.

After completing the crew-worn and static measurements, the data was then transferred from all three dosimeters
to the Space Station Computer (SSC) and downlinked Via the Orbital Communications Adapter (OCA) as shown in
Fig. 4. The following paragraphs will discussed the crew-worn and static location measurements.

1. Crew-wom measurement

The crewmembers donned acoustic dosimeters before breakfast on the day of the acoustic dosimetry activity for
the duration of 24 hours to record the work—day and sleep period data, see Fig. 5. The 24-hour equivalent noise
exposure levels, LA,24 or LEQ, given in Table 2, as an example, reﬂects the actual crew-wear times, T. All noise
exposure levels were recorded using the S-dB exchange rate (ER).16

LA, T was the equivalent noise exposure level during the work and sleep time periods. LAPK was the highest
instantaneous noise level measured during the measurement period. Required use of hearing protection was given in
Table 2 in the far right column, based on the Flight Rule Bl3-152, see table 1. Per recommendations of the
Multilateral Medical Operations Panel (MMOP) Acoustics Sub-Group, the 3-dB exchange rate will, in the future, be
used instead of a S-dB exchange rate when measuring noise exposures on 188. The 3-dB exchange rate has been
adopted by the National Institute of Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) and is used internationally.17 The
current acoustic dosimeter has the capability for recording the noise data using both exchange rates. For reference
only until the new 188 Acoustic Flight Rule update is approve, the acoustic dosimetry data was also reported using
the 3-dB exchange rate.

As discussed above, the acoustic dosimeter also has the capability for logging data. An example of a crew-worn
acoustic dosimeter logged data can be seen in Fig. 6. The work—day and sleep periods are easily distinguishable from

Fig. 6, the cumulative LA; had also been plotted against time using both 3— (dotted line) and 5—dB (solid line)
exchange rates, respectively. This logged data provides information with regards to the overall crew noise exposure.
As it can be seen in the graph, several crew tasks/actiVities were above 80 dBA but below the hazard limit of 85
dBA. Overall, based on the current ISS Acoustic Flight Rule, this particular crewrnernber was exposed to a noise

level of 69 dBA which required wearing hearing protection for 11 hours based on the ISS Acoustic Flight Rule (see
Table 1). This hearing protection requirement only applied to the crewrnernber wearing the acoustic dosirneter and
the information was obtained after the fact. This illustrates why the ﬂight rules are being updated.

Crew—worn dosirnetry data on ISS has been collected since Increment 1, see Fig. 7. This data was based on all
crewrnembers who were a long—tirne resident in ISS since November 2001. Based on the trend of the data and the
current ISS Acoustic Flight Rule, many crewrnembers’ LEQ were above the 67 dBA ISS Flight Rule level. Since
Increment 21, more crewrnernbers’ LEQ levels have been below the ISS Flight Rule. This decrease in noise exposure
levels was mostly the result of general improvements in acoustic levels on ISS as described in Ref. 11.
Improvements include noise mitigation in the Russian Segment, as well as the addition of new quiet modules.

The noise exposure level for the work period was dependent on where the crewrnember spent most of their time.
The crewrnernber can work in the Russian segment, the US segment or spend time working equally in both
segments, see Fig. 8 for a distribution of LEQ during work hours. The data showed that the crewrnembers who
worked in the Russian segment were exposed to higher noise levels than crewrnembers who worked in the US
segment. Use of hearing protection was recommended when working in the Russian Service Module, when
exercising on the treadrnills, and when exposed to higher noise levels.

The crew quarters were designed to provide a personal, private area for a crewrnember to rest, sleep, and work
and for personal actiVities. Work actiVities included reading/writing, computer usage, and reView of reports and
procedures. Personal actiVities included changing clothes, reading/writing, and computer usage or watching movies
or writing ernails, listening to music, personal communication, and private work consultations. It also provided
lirnited stowage for personal items, clothing, and computer accessories. Design features included isolation from
exterior light and noise as well as reduction of exposure to space radiation and it also provided a thermal
environment and internal illurnination that is comfortable and adjustable.18 The Ternporary Early Sleep Station

crewmembers slept in the Russian crew quarters (Port and Starboard kayuta). The TeSS was the precursor to the US
crew quarters (CQs); it did not have an adjustable ventilation system or an alarm annunciation system. The TeSS
was deployed in the US Lab and later retired as a sleep station once the four permanent US crew quarters were
supplied to ISS. All four US crew quarters are located in Node 2. It has been estimated that long—duration
crewmembers can expect to spend one—third of their entire mission inside one of the CQs.

hearing protection devices while sleeping due to high noise levels. Initially, the kayutas were designed with a
porthole and a door, but the door was then removed on—orbit during Increment 1. A door was later provided and
installed to the kayutas as well as noise control mitagations to Russian segment hardware components were
incorporated. The crew quarters used during the NASA—Mir Program did not have any door. Many of the
crewmember’s comments were related to the lack of door on the crew quarter, preventing noise and light from
entering the sleep station.19 Due to the noise control strategies, noise levels in the kayutas have decreased on the

recorded above 70 dBA during Increment 6 and as low as 50 dBA during Increment 25.

The ISS crew’s sleep—time noise exposure levels for crew quarters located in the US segment are shown in Fig.
10. During early stages of ISS, when the US crew quarters were not available, crewmembers slept in the TeSS
(located in the US Lab), and in locations within the other pressurized modules such as Node 1, J apanese Pressurized
Module (JPM), the Columbus module and even in a Visiting vehicle. These locations were all temporary. The four
permanent US crew quarters (Port, Startboard, Deck and Overhead) became available to ISS crewmembers starting
in Increment 18. Currently, there are a total of six crew quarters, two Russian (kayutas) crew and the four US crew
quarters. The US and Russian crew quarters are adequately quiet to provide hearing rest and do not caused an
increased risk for hearing loss. The exceedances 0f the sleep requirements (US: 49 dBA and Russian: 50 dBA) were
an increased risk to restful sleep. The World Health Organization (WHO) recommends a night noise exposure
(Lnight) value 0f 40 dB to be the target of the night noise guideline to protect the public.20 However, WHO also
recommends an Lnight value of 55 dB as an interim target when the 40 dB level cannot be initially met. Crew debriefs
have indicated that crew sleep had not been effected by ISS sleep station noise levels. Different types and sizes of
hearing protection devices were always available to crewmembers 0n ISS if needed to help mitigate this risk.

Figure 11 shows the distribution of LEQ levels during sleep hours. The data shows that the noise levels in the
kayutas, in the Russian segment, were higher than the crew quarter levels in the US segment. The median noise
levels for the TeSS are lower than the US and Russian crew quarter median levels. This followed the same trend

levels had a median level of 58 dBA, ranging from 44 to 72 dBA. This resulted in a 12 dBA difference. This was
mainly due to the difference in median noise levels between the Russian and US segments Where the crew quarters
are located, and also by the design differences between the US and Russian crew quarters. In addition to the design
differences, the variation in the sleep period noise exposure levels could also be due to Whether or not the crew

dosimeters were cycled through each of the ISS pressurized modules or areas of concern, such as; areas near

had been collected in this location since Increment 16. As expected, the noise level in this location had decreased (as

as few as three or as many as twelve crew—worn measurements. In this case and for this reason, an Increment was
considered a homogenous noise exposure group.
The standard also identiﬁes the main sources of uncertainty that can contribute to the results. For the ISS
study, these sources were: (1) variations in the daily work, operating conditions, uncertainty in sampling, (2)
instrurnention and calibration, (3) microphone placement, (4) false contributions, for example: airﬂows 0r impacts
on the microphone and/or the microphone rubbing on clothes, (5) lacking or faulty work analysis, and (6)
contributions from non—typical noise sources; speech, music alarrn signals, and non—typical behavior. After
identifying the sources of uncertainty, the evaluation of measurement uncertainties was completed. There were three
measurement uncertainties that were calculated, 111 (standard uncertainty for sampling of job noise levels), uz
(standard uncertainty for the instrumentation used), and u3 (standard uncertainty due to measurement position). The
three standard uncertainties were then used to calculate the combined standard ucertainty, u, and ﬁnally the
expanded uncertainty, U. The standard also provides an Excel© spreadsheet for performing the calculations. The
equations and the spreadsheet used for calculating the standard uncertainties and the expanded uncertainty are
discussed in detail in the ISO Standard 9612 and will not be discussed in this paper. Based on the calculations
performed, the crewrnernbers onboard ISS were exposed to a daily (LEQ_24) A—weighted range noise exposure level
of 65 to 71 dBA, during Increments 1—26, with the associated expanded uncertainty for a one—sided coverage
probability of 95% (k = 1.65) of 2.2 to 6.1 dBA, see Fig. 16. The data showed that Increments 2—4, because of the
large uncertainty, may have more than one homogenous noise exposure group; further analysis will be required in
these three Increments (2—4).

V. Discussion
This paper describes the noise exposure monitoring program as well as an assessment of the acoustic dosimeter
data collected to date. Acoustic data onboard ISS has been collected since it was inhabited by three crewrnembers on
November 2001 (Increment 1). The data collected from Increments 1 through 16 do not include logged tirne—history
data. These data points provided one noise exposure value per measurement session and required the crew to
13

"
"14","provide a hand-tabulation of data which then was called down to Mission Control. This is the ﬁrst time that this
acoustic dosimetry data has been published as a complete dataset. Noise exposure data from Increments 1-9 have
been previously published. 22

The data also provided trending information with regard to the work and sleep environments experienced by the
crewmembers on 188. The work environment average noise level tended to remain fairly constant, ﬂuctuating from
67 to 73 dBA, with higher levels recorded in the Russian On-Orbit Segments. In contrast, the sleep enVironnient
average noise level has declined, decreasing by approximately 10 dBA in the noise exposure levels in the kayutas
located in the Russian Service Module. However, the average noise level for the full-day tracked the work levels and
variations seen in the work environment data log. Overall, there has been an improvement in the acoustical
environment on 188. These measurements were highly dependent on the actiVities/tasks the crew on 188, whether
occupational or leisure, have been engaged during their stay on 188.

The sleep period noise exposure levels can vary depending on many factors such as where is the crew quarter
located (US or Russian On-Orbit Segments), if the crew quarter’s door is opened or closed, and what the fan’s speed
(low, medium or high) was or if the crewmember listened to music or watched movies. Many of these factors can
contribute to the variation seen in the measured data. Better understanding of these factors will provide a better
understanding of the contribution that each factor can add to the overall noise exposure level.

The static dosimetry data has proven to be an excellent asset for evaluating hardware or payload performance, for
example: evaluating clogged IMV fans, and can also assist as a preventative maintenance guide by providing
correlation as to when maintenance should be performed. This data can also serve as an environmental data point or
spot check for validating crew-worn dosimetry data. Having an environmental data point will help in calculating the
uncertainty of the dataset and will provide a better representation of the noise exposure environment. Understanding
the acoustical environment is Vital for all space programs.

The data suggests an improvement in the environment; however hearing loss has been documented in long-
duration spaceﬂights. For example, one of the seven US crewmembers who ﬂew on the Mir Space Station returned
with a temporary threshold shift (TTS).23 Data from the Russian Space Program on long-duration space ﬂights (i.e.
Salyut and Mir) reported TTS and in some cases permanent threshold shifts (PTS) on some of their cosmonauts.24 A
Russian long-duration ground study showed that continuous exposure to levels of 75 dBA can lead to TTS.25
However, during short-duration space ﬂights, e.g. Space Shuttle program, clinically signiﬁcant temporary and
permanent threshold shifts were not observed on the crewnienibers.24’26’27 To date, clinically signiﬁcant PTS have
not been documented for 188 crewmenibers, however cases of TTS with subsequent recovery has occurred.”<
Lessons learned from past space programs have shown to be very beneﬁcial to the 188 Program.

VI. Future Directions

The crewmembers on 188 have several modules in which they can spend time during the day. Accurately
tracking their activities, tasks, and noise exposure in these modules is a signiﬁcant task all by itself. The current
dosimeters used onboard 188 have the capability for recording and logging data in one-minute intervals. However,
correlating crew activities to recorded data can be a difﬁcult task unless a crewnieniber’s timeline is well deﬁned
with time stamps corresponding to completed activities. Currently, this correlation between the recorded data and
crew timeline is lacking. An activity is being planned for collecting on-orbit data that will provide a basis for a noise
hazard mapping of areas and activities on 188 that contribute signiﬁcantly to the noise exposure experienced by the
crew. Presently, hearing protection requirements are based on 24-hour noise exposure measurements which provide
little information as to the cause of the exposure (188 Flight Rule). As a result, hearing protection usage is speciﬁed
as hours per day with no consideration for when (according to acoustic loading) the hearing protection would be
most effective. Also, the Flight Rule requires HPD to be worn after the data has been collected, with no predictive
capability. As a result, the current Flight Rule is not implementable and is not enforced. HPD use recommendations
are made through the Flight Surgeons and medical teams. But J SC Flight Rules — Bl3-152 is not strictly enforced.

"
"15","The Noise Hazard Inventory (NHI) will provide a correlation between noise exposure increments and identiﬁed
activities and locations so that informed recommendations for when the crew should wear hearing protection can be
made. In addition, the data will be analyzed to determine sources of excessive noise and indicate need for future
noise mitigations. The information, gathered through implementation of a data logging activity, will be correlated
on the ground with the time-dependent sound levels measured by the current acoustic dosimeters, and the NHI will
be developed. The NHI will reduce the risk for noise-induced hearing loss, and will improve voice communications
by avoiding non-productive mandated hearing protection use. The NHI will be used for implementing a new
acoustic ﬂight rule that is based on a “task-based” hearing conservation approach. Task—based methods have distinct
advantages over full-shift methods in that they provide a better understanding of sources of high noise exposurezg’29

Another area that needs great consideration is crewtime allocation for maintenance tasks. As ISS moves from
Assembly Complete to a National Research Laboratory, less and less crewtime will be available for performing
nominal environmental monitoring tasks. The crew on 188 will be very busy performing research activities. An
automated system is a possible solution for monitoring sound pressure and noise exposure levels in long-duration
space vehicles. The automated system should require little to no crew interaction for normal operations thus freeing
up time for scientiﬁc research.

VII. Conclusions

Crew-worn acoustic dosimetry data have been collected onboard 188 since November 2001, when the 188 was
ﬁrst occupied by the ﬁrst three crewmembers. Data has shown that acoustic requirements at all levels and noise
control mitigations have produced a decrease in sleep-time noise exposure levels, by approximately 10 dBA in the
kayutas crew quarters. Static dosimetry has also helped identify hardware anomalies. Overall, there has been an
improvement in the acoustical environment on 188. These dosimetry measurements which are highly dependent on
the actiVities/tasks the crew perform on 188, whether occupational or leisure, have been captured during their stay on
188. As we learn how to better correlate the crew timeline with the recorded acoustic dosimetry data, our ability to
protect the crewmembers onboard 188 will be enhanced.
