SUMMARY
The unfolded protein response (UPR) is a signaling network triggered by overload of protein-folding
demand in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), a condition termed ER stress. The UPR is critical for growth and
development; nonetheless, connections between the UPR and other cellular regulatory processes remain
largely unknown. Here, we identify a link between the UPR and the phytohormone auxin, a master regulator
of plant physiology. We show that ER stress triggers down-regulation of auxin receptors and transporters in
Arabidopsis thaliana. We also demonstrate that an Arabidopsis mutant of a conserved ER stress sensor
|RE1 exhibits defects in the auxin response and levels. These data not only support that the plant |RE1 is
required for auxin homeostasis, they also reveal a species-specific feature of |RE1 in multicellular eukary-
otes. Furthermore, by establishing that UPR activation is reduced in mutants of ER-localized auxin trans-
porters, including PIN5, we define a long-neglected biological significance of ER-based auxin regulation. We
further examine the functional relationship of |RE1 and P|N5 by showing that an ire1 pin5 triple mutant
enhances defects of UPR activation and auxin homeostasis in ire1 or pin5. Our results imply that the plant
UPR has evolved a hormone-dependent strategy for coordinating ER function with physiological processes.
