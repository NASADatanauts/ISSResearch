Fig. 5. Temperature—dependent locomotor activity. (A) The locomotor activity increases at low and high temperature and is dependent on the rate of change of temperature.
Low temperature corresponded to 22 °C< T< 33 0C, and high temperature to 33 °C< T< 37.5 0C. High rate of temperature change corresponded to dT/dt= 0.8 OC/min and low
rate of change to 0.2 OC/min. N=Total number of events. (B) Event frequency versus measured temperature for the ﬂies. The rising and falling temperatures are shown in
separate shades of gray to illustrate the hysteresis in the response to temperature.
