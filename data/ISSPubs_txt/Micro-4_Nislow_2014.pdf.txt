Spaceﬂightis a unique environment Withpro found effects on biolo gic a1 systems including tissue
redistrlbution and musculoskeletal stresses. However, the more subtle biological effects of
spaceﬂighton cells and organisms are difficult to measure in a systematic, unb iased manner.Here
we test the utility of the molecularly-bareoded yeast deletion collection to provide a quantitative
assessment of the effects of micro gravity on a model organism We developed robust hardware
to screen, in parallel, the complete collection 0f~4800 homozygous and ~5900 heterozygous
(including ~1100 single- copy deletions of essential genes) yeast deletion strains, each carrying
unique DNA that act as strain identiﬁers. We compared strain ﬁtness for the homozygous and
heterozygousyeast deletion eolleetionsgrown in spaceﬂight and ground, as well as plus and
minus hyperosmolar sodium chloride, providing a second additive stres sor. The genome-Wide
sensitivity pro ﬁles obtained from these treatments were then queried for their similarity to a
compendium ofdrugs Whose effects on the yeast collection have been previously reported. We
found that the effects of space ﬂight have high concordance With the effects of DNA- damaging
agents and changes in redox state, suggesting mechanisms by Which spaceﬂight may negatively
affect cell ﬁtness.

"4","Introduction
Physical effects of microgravity during space ﬂight can often be de scrlb edbyequations that
allowtheir quantifieati0n[1, 2].F0r example, microgravity has well-deﬁned effects on
sedimentation in association With reduc ed terminal velocity and shear in suspension culture [3]
andredueed gravity—dependent convection of gases [4].Bi010giea1 effects of spaceﬂight 011 cells
and organisms on the other hand, are much harder to deﬁne [1, 2].F0r example, spaceﬂight also
entails radiation exposure, Which has been studied in diverse systems but Whose effects are not
ﬁally underst00d[5]. What is needed is a r0bust,unb iased, quantiﬁable system that is relevant for
translation to ground-based applicationsand that is able to clearly distinguish sp aeeﬂight
effectslt is our premise that yeast deletion eollectionsare ideally suited for this type ofanalysis
as ye ast can be precisely controlled genetically and are readily grown under space ﬂight
conditionsBiological responses of yeast strains during spaceﬂight can be quantiﬁed and
compared to well- established databases of ground-based stressors and the comparisons can
reveal features that are unique to micro gravityas well as features that are shared With ground-
based perturbationsWhile yeast cannot completely reﬂect the complexities of a mammalian cells
organized into tissues, the high degree of homology shared With human (~70% of all es sential
yeast genes have a significant human h0m010g)pr0vides hypotheses for the mechanism of many
responses of interest [6, 7].
Previous studies have attempted to identify, isolate, and offset the various physical factors
changing during spaceﬂight to demonstrate their effects in an iterative fashi0n[8- 10]. Earlier
studies on the effects ofspaee radiation on yeast failed to ﬁnd any change in point mutation
rates, DNA replication and/or repair, heritable damage, or colony morphology [5, 8, 11, 12].

"
"5","However, those studies were limited by the available endpoint analysis too Is. In contrast, we
applied the yeast deletion collection as a biological reporter to understand the metabolic
pathways affecting survival during culture in spaceﬂight. In this fashion, we are able to make
genome-wide comparisons and test for concordance a gainst an extensive library of more than
3200 physical and pharmacological stressors [13].
Yeast is the ﬁrst, and to date only, organism for which a complete, genome-wide
knockdowneollection is available. This collection is comprised of a genome-wide set Ofstrains
whereeach strain carries a precise deletion of a single gene [14].Assemb1ed over a four-year
period by a consortium 0f351ab0rat0ries, this collection has been used by hundreds of
laboratories to test thousands of different environmental stressors to de ﬁne the genes required for
survival in the se conditions (see [15] for review).The molecular barcodes present in each strain
allow the yeast deletion colleetionto be grown as a pool in the presence or absence of the stressor
of interest after which the relative abundance ofeach strain is subsequently quantiﬁed[16].
Strains carrying a deletion of a gene requiredfor survival in the presence of the stressor grow
more slowly, and thus exhibita ﬁtness defect reﬂected by the irreduced abundance at the end of
the culture period. In this manner, all genes required for growth can be readily identiﬁed in a
single experiment, revealingthe genes and associated pathways affected by the stressor.
T0 identifythe metabolic and genomic pathways affected by spaceﬂight,the homozygous and
heterozygous yeast deletion collectionswere grown in space ﬂight and ground control conditions,
with and without hyperosmolar sodium chloride, providinga second stressorln sp aceﬂight
a10ne,the homozygousdeletion collectionrevealed the importance of processes linked to

"6","mitochondria, While the heterozygous collection highlighted genes involved in regulating
translation and r1130 somal RNA transport. Both homozygous and heterozygous collections
highlighted DNA repair.With the addition ofNaCl, the homozygous collection also revealed the
importance of RNA—related processes including ribosome assembly and biogenesis, mRN A
processing and decay, as well as modiﬁcation of tRNAs. Moreover, the NaCl addition
highlightedreplieation processes more clearly (compared to the homozygous collection Without
NaCl), sugge sting that spaceﬂight has measurable effects on the se core and evolutionarily
eonservedproeesses. With the heterozygous collection, the addition ofNaCl led to the
identiﬁcation of a nuclear pore organization gene, potentially providing additional insight
intohow RNA transport is affected by spaceﬂight.Taken together, the deletion collections
identiﬁed several biological processes associated With space ﬂight, and the additional
hyperosmolar stress emphasized the importance ofrelated proees ses.
In a follow-up analysis, we queriedthe effects of spaceﬂightagainst a database of drugeffeets 0n
yeast to search for the se that are most concordant, thereby suggesting similar mechanisms of
perturbation. Not only do the effects of space ﬂight have relatively high concordance With the
effects of DNA-damaging a gents, but also there is tight a greement amongst multip 1e therapeutic
agents in this drug class, providing additional support for the se ﬁndings.
Materials and Methods
Ove rall design
The OpticellTM Processing Module, described below, was used to perform a series 0f~21
generation pooled growth experiments on two yeast deletion collections: i)~4800 homozygous
6

"
"7","strains and ii) ~5900 heterozygous strains (including ~1100 single-eopy deletions ofessential
genes), each carrying unique DNA bareodes that act as strain identiﬁers. Experiments were
performed in both rich media, and in rich media supplemented with 0.5M NaCl to as sess the
additional effect of osmotic stress on survival. The samples ﬂew sortie on space shuttle mission
STS- 135 to the International Space Station (188). Parallel control exp eriments were performed
in static 1G terrestrial controls in the Orbital Environmental Simulator at Kennedy Space Center
to match temperature, humidity, air composition, and volatile organic compounds. Ground
controls were conducted in a 24-hour asynchronous fashion to allow matching of the
experimental timelines 011 188 as relayed through air-to ground communication by the ﬂight
crew. At the end of the growth period, the ﬁtness of each strain in each exp erirnental pool was
assessed as described [17]. Brieﬂy, genomic DNA was extracted from each sample, the
barcodes in each p001 were ampliﬁed by PCR, and the abundance ofeach barcode was quantiﬁed
by next generation sequencing. A barcode count re ﬂeets the abundance of the corresponding
strain at the end of the experiment, that is, a quantiﬁcation of the relative requirement of the
deleted gene for growth in the tested condition. In total, the experiment results in a count for
each gene resulting in a gene list rank ordered by their imp ortance for growth in the tested
condition.
Yeast Deletion P001 c0 nstruction
The yeast deletion collections were stored as individual strains in YPD containing 7% DMSO at
—800C, in 96-wellplates. The plates were thawed, mixed, and robotieally pinned onto YPD a gar
plates as an array of 384 strains. After two days of growth at 30°C, colonies were consolidated
(four plates of 384 to one plate of 1536 colonies) and robotieally pinned in triplicate. Cells were

"8","grown in 30°C for 2—3 days until colonies f0rmSlow growing strains were grown separately for
2—3 additional days. All plates were then ﬂooded with 5—7 n110fn1edia, scraped and pooled in
YPD-7% DMSO to a ﬁnal concentration 0fOD600 = 50, and frozen at —800C until use, as
described [17].
Construction of Opticell culture system and spaceﬂight experiment
In this study, we designed the OpticellTM Processing Module 0r OPM (F igure 1)that was capable
of maintaining the ye ast deletion collection as a pool grown in liquid culture for at least 20
generations in micro gravity. The hardware comprised a liquid- sealed system of growth chambers
(OptieellsTM) that allowed for gas exchange across polystyrene membranesEach OPM consisted
of threeNunc OpticellsTM held to gether with a common manifo 1d and valve system that is
autoclaved and attached with watertight O-ring seals. A 3m1 syringe connected to the manifold
with a Luer ﬁtting is used to trans fer liquid between chambers and mix without breaking sterility
and with minimal operator intervention. The valve on the manifo 1d has four settings that connect
the syringe to 1 = no Optieells, 2 = Opticell A, 3 = Optieell B, or 4 = Opticell C. The OPM
allows propagation of each deletion collection for a combined ~21 generations of growth when
three chambers are used and the inoculum and trans fer volumes are 0.5m1.
To perform a growth assay in the OPM, each of the three chambers was preﬁlled with 7ml of
sterile growth mediaDeletion collection aliquots were preloaded into each syringe and shipped
to Kennedy Space Center, frozen in media containing 7% DMSO (V/V) as a
cryoproteetantDuring ﬁnal integration at Kennedy Space Center, the OPMs were pre-chilled t0
4°C.Eaeh deletion collection aliquot was thawed, attached to an OPM manifo 1d,injected and
8

"
"9","mixed into chamber A. Cultures were maintained at 4 OC and ﬂown to the International Space
Station (ISS).The growth experiment was initiated on orbit by warming the OPMs t0 300C.After
16-24h at 300C, a 0.5 ml sample was removed from chamber A using the same syringe and
inoculated into chamber B.The process was repeated 16-24h0urs later to inoculate 0.5ml of
sample from chamber B into chamber C.After an additional 16-24 hours, the OPMs were cooled
back down to 40C to greatly reduce any further growth and preserve the samples for return to
Earth and post- ﬂight analysis.EXp0nential yeast growth leads to early depletion of growth media
nutrients and signiﬁcant retardation of further growth well before 16-24 hours. Growth is
limited by media volume early and strain distrlbution within the yeast deletion library reaches a
steady state within that Opticell
Next generation sequencing
The ﬂight samples returned from the ISSwere handled in parallel with the ground control set.
The OPM was disassembled into its three Opticells, and the entire contents were transferred to a
storage tube using a blunt needle connected to a 20ml syringe. One ml of each sample (at a ﬁnal
OD600 0f1.0-2.0)was processed to extract genomic DNA.Puriﬁed deletion p001 DNA was
ampliﬁed in two separate PCR reactions as described [17]and the amplicons purified prior to
sequencing on an Illumina HiSeq2000. Each puriﬁed amplieon library was sequenced to a
minimum depth of 500 eounts/strain/sample as described [18]. Duplicate experiments were
performed for all conditions; to ensure that at least one complete time course was collected for
each p001(heterozyg0te and homozygote) and each condition. Due to failures in sample
processing, several time points were not recovered, or did not meet our in- house quality metrics
9

"
"10","(e.g. if sequence eounts/strain were below threshold values). Accordingly, we focused on
evaluating each experimental condition using singleton data as described in Table 1.
Data Analys is
All computational analyses were performed using R [19]unless otherwise indicated.
Normalization of sequence counts
Sequence counts for each strain in each experiment were quantiﬁed and normalized according to
[18].Brieﬂy, each 20- mer barcode was ampliﬁed with primers comprised of the common barcode
primers in addition to the sequences required for cluster formation on the Illumina ﬂow eell.F0r
multiplexed Illumina sequencing, 5-mer ta g sequences were incorporated into each primer
between the Illumina and barcode primer sequencesThis multiplexing ta g allowed post-
sequencing assignment ofeach arnplieon to a particular experiment. Results for the 7-generati0n
time point of the heterozygous deletion p001 grown in spaceﬂight without NaCl did not pass our
quality control and consequently, that time point was omitted from analyses of the heterozygous
p001with0utNaCl.All other counts were mean—norrnalized between experiments such that each
experiment had the same mean count. We added ten pseudo-eounts to all sequence tag tallies
(and thus, all sub sequent gene tallies) to prevent division by zero during data analyses (see Table
81, Table 82 for mean normalized counts).
Barco de selection for each strain
For each strain, we used signal from only the upstream or the downstream barcode(relative t0 the
deletion site).First, we as sumed that barcode counts ClO se to zero represent background 110 ise

10

"
"11","(e.g. p0ss1bly due to incorrect mapping of reads to barcodes). We thus selected a background
threshold(bgThresh0 Id: 100, see Parameter selection), assuming that counts below it do not
accurately reﬂect strain abundance. Then, for eachtime course, we ﬁltered out barcodes where
the average (normalized) count for the ﬁrst 14 generations(the earliest time point with usable
data in all experiments) was below bgThreshoZd.This ﬁltering removed all barcodes for ~650-
3200 strains (depending on the time course), and these strains were omitted from subsequent
analyses; see Supplementary Table S3 (homozygous strains) and S4 (heterozygous strains).
For time courses that only had two time points (and thus an inefﬁcient number to compute ﬁts),
strains that still had two barcodes after ﬁltering were represented by their upstream barcodes due
to their overall better behavior observed in a previous study [20].F0r other time courses, linear
ﬁts (with and without the time 10 gged) were computed for each remaining barcodeWe de ﬁned
the best ﬁt as the ﬁt with the lowest residual sum ofsquares (RSS), and used the F -test to
compute a P value estimating the significance with which the ﬁtted model is better than the null
model (of a ﬂat line at the average count value).The Benjamini and Hochberg method was used
to correct the P for multiple comparisons and generate F DR values [21].Strains with two
remaining bareodes were represented by the barcode with the higher R2(a measure of the amount
of variation in the data explained by the ﬁtted model), and thus the better ﬁt andpotentially less
noise.
Parameter selection
The selected normalization method (tested mean and quartile normalization) andbgThreshold
(tested 50, 100 and 150) is the combination that resulted in the most signiﬁcant enrichment of

1 1

"
"12","slow growing strains identiﬁed in the heterozygous deletion p001, sampled every two generations
for 20 generations (data not shown),with slow growersidentiﬁed in a previous study [22].
Brie ﬂy, we de ﬁned slow growers as those exhibiting sizab 1e decreases in abundance over
timeThe signiﬁcance of the decrease was estimated with F DR values (see Bareode selection for
each strain), and the magnitude was estimated with AA U C = (<area under the growth eurve> -
<area under the ﬂat growth curve>)/(tmax — to), where the ﬂat growth curve is ﬁxed at the t0
abundance level, and the area under a curve is estimated using the trapezoid methodAlso, if at
some time point the abundance of a strain is 1e ss than or equal to bgThresho Id and remains at
negligible levels for the rest of the time course, we identiﬁed the strain as slow growing.
Identification of significant fitness defects in time point c0 mparisons
To identify strains that exhibited significant ﬁtness defects at a later time point (14 or 21
generations) compared to the ﬁrst time point (7 generations), normalized counts less than
bgThreshoZd were ﬁrst forced to equal bgThresho Id. Then for each strain, we computed 10 gzratio
= 10g2(abundanee7g/abundanee14G/21g) where abundaneeyG is the count of the strain at y
generations. For a given time point, robust Z scores were computed from the set of 10 gzratios,
e.g.Z,~ = (10 gzratiol- - <10g2rati0 median>)/<10g2rati0 MAD> for strain 1'. Each Zl- was then used to
obtain P,- from the standard normal distribution, and we assume that strains with low P values are
outliers in the distribution of 10 gzratio s. Moreover, strains with counts abo ve bgThresho Id at the
ﬁrst time point and counts equivalent to bgThreshold at the later time point of interest are
deﬁned as having dropped out. Taken to gether, we de ﬁne strains with signiﬁcant ﬁtness de feets
at a speciﬁc time point as strains with 10 gzratio 2 1 and P 3 0001, and/or strains that dropped
0ut(Tab1e SS, Table S6).

"
"13","Spaceﬂight ve rsus ground co mparisons

For comparisons involving speciﬁc time points, we identiﬁed the set of strains that exhibited

signiﬁcant ﬁtness de feets (relative to the ﬁrst time point) in the ﬂight condition but not in the

ground condition. This set is then further re stricted to the set of strains with useab 1e data in both

conditions.

Gene ontology (GO) enrichme nt analysis

We obtained Gene Onto 10 gy (GO) annotations of yeast genes from the Saccharomyces Genome

Database (downloaded on May 26, 2012). GO biologicalproeesses that were too specific

(contain less than ﬁve genes) or too genera1(eontain greater than 300 genes) were excluded from

the analysis.

Given a query set of genes (e.g. genes deleted from a set of (ﬂight— ground) strains), we used the

hypergeometrie test to obtain a P value estimating the significance with which the set is enriched

with genes annotated to a given biologicalproeess, relative to a gene universe deﬁned as the set

of genes with usable data for both ﬂight and ground conditionsDue to a limited number of

signiﬁcantly enriched processes following correction for multiple comparisons (FDR S 0.1), here

we report significantly enriched processes prior to the correction (PS 0.01).

We Visualized GO enrichment results with enrichment maps shown in Figures 2 and 3 that were

generated using an appro aeh similar to the Enrichment Map Cyto scape Plugin V1.1 [23, 24].In

contrast to the plugin, the nodes in each map were clustered with MCL (inﬂation = 2), using the
13

"
"14","overlap coefﬁcient computed by the plugin as the similarity metric (coefﬁcients less than 0.5
were set to zero).Nodes in the same cluster were assigned the same node color, and a cluster
label was determined based on common themes in the processes within the oluster.Moreover, the
size of a node was made to be proportional to the significance with which the corresponding
process is enriched [-log10(P)].anh bar plot summarizes the genes that contribute the most to the
enrichment of processes with the same node color as the plot border. Specifically, a plot shows
the ﬂight— associated genes that are annotated to the largest number of relevant proo esses (if more
than 10 genes, only the top 10 are shown). For each gene, the bar length is proportional to a
ﬁtness defect measure (i.e. logzratio).
The enrichment maps also combine two sets of enrichment results, with the processes enriched in
one set shown with circle nodes, the prooes ses enriched in the second set shown with square
nodes, and the processes enriched in both sets shown with diamond nodes.
Simila rity between ﬂight-associated genes and co mpound-associated genes
We previously treated pools of yeast deletion strains with ~3200 compounds separately
[13].anh compound was sub sequently associated with a set of genes deleted from strains that
exhibited signiﬁcant ﬁtness defects induced by the compound. Like sets of ﬂight-assooiated
genes in this study, sets of oompound-assooiated genes were assessed for enrichment of genes
annotated to speciﬁc biologicalprooesses (as described above), resulting in an ""enrichment
pro ﬁle"" for each condition of intere st. In each pro ﬁle, each process is associated with a P
measuring the signiﬁcance of enrichment. Similarity between a pair of enrichment pro ﬁles was
computed by concordance of - lo g10(P) across all processes common to both pro ﬁles, where

14

"
"15","concordance is like Pearson correlation except that scale is not ignoredCompounds With
enrichment pro ﬁles that are most similar to a given ﬂight enrichment pro ﬁle may induce cellular
responses that are most similar to the response induced by ﬂight.

"17","in YPD plus 0.5M NaCl, 3) heterozygous deletion collection in YPD, and 4) heterozygous
deletion collection in YPD plus 0.5M NaC1.Each culture was sampled at three different time
points: 7 generations, 14 generations and 21 generations and shown in Table 1.Sarnp1es from
ground controls were compared to the corresponding samples grown in microgravity 0n the 188.
We analyzedchanges in strain abundance by comparing the each time point to a later time
pointUsing thisapproaehallowed us to capture these strains that became depleted in any seven-
generation intervaLStrains with sizable decreases in measured abundance or with abundances
that drop to background levels (and remain there) were identiﬁed as exhibiting ﬁtness defects
(FDS). Moreover, strains with ﬂight— speciﬁc FDswere identified by subtracting the strains with
FDs in the ground condition.
For the purposes of our Gene Ontology (GO; http://amig0. geneontology.0rg) enrichment
analysis, we considered the homozygous and heterozygous data sep arately.Based 011 a wealth of
published data [14, 15], the homozygous, non-essential deletion collection tends to reveal a
similar set of genes involved in pathways required for resistance to/surVival in multip 1e
environmental conditions, whereas the hetero zygous collection of all strains tends to be more
speciﬁc, identifying essentialproteins uniquely required for growth in aspeeiﬁc condition [13].
For the homozygous deletion collection, strains that were depleted from the poolspeciﬁeally in
spaceﬂight conditions aresigniﬁeantly enriched for genes in biologicalprocesses related to
different asp ects of RNA metabolism and catabolism, including: r1130 some bio genesis, regulation
of rlbosomal protein transcription, cytoplasmic RNA translation, rRNA processing, tRNA

"
"18","modification, and InRN A decay (Table 2, Figure 2 and Table SS). We also found that processes
related to DNA integrity were required for survival in spaceﬂightln particular, the linked
processes of DNA repair, DNA recombination and replication as well as chromatin remodeling
were all required for resistance to the effects of S13 aceﬂight. Finally, the se DNA repair
requirements extend to the mitochondria, which, by virtue of its small genome, is hypersensitive
to DNA damage. Consistent with this, we found that genes required for both mitochondrial
maintenance and for proper protein localization to the mitochondria were enriched in the
homozygous samples.
The enrichment of these particular processes is consistent with a general induction of DNA
damage, which, in turn, perturbs RNA biogenesis[25].Interesting1y we have previously observed
this phenomenon with a class 0ftherapeuties that act as nucleotide analogs, such as 5-
ﬂuorouridine and ﬂuoroeytosine (described in detail below).Additi0nally, it is particularly
noteworthy that, although we do see evidence of a requirement for RNA and DNA processing
genes in spaceﬂight alone, the requirement is exacerbated when spaceﬂight is combined with the
additional hyperosmotic stress imposed by the addition of 0.5M NaCl (Table S6). We speculate
that the added salt stress potentiates the DNA-darnaging effects of spaceﬂight Via the induction
of reactive oxygen species (ROS). The ability of salt stress to induce ROS and subsequent DNA
damage has been previously reported [26]and in particular, the yeast mitochondria appears to be
hypersensitive to this type Ofstres s, consistent with its small genome being susceptible to the
effects of DNA damage [27]. Furthermore,mitoch0ndrial protein abundance has been shown to
rapidly increase upon osmotic shock, and therefore the enrichment for mitochondrial protein
10 calization we ob serve may re ﬂeet this requirement.

18

"
"19","To gain further insight into the pathways that modulate the response to both micro gravity stress
and combined sp aeeﬂight and salt stress, we used the GO enrichment pro ﬁles to query a database
ofover 3200 distinct drug treatments of the yeast deletion collections [13].Specifieally we
quantiﬁed the similarity between the GO enrichments by computing the concordance 0f - lo g10(P)
between any two pro ﬁles, where P measures the signiﬁcance of enrichment of a single GO
categoryThese concordance values are similar to Pearson correlation values, i.e. values 010 ser to
one indicate greater similarity between pro ﬁles, except that high concordance also requires the
scale of values to be similar between the proﬁlesWhen calculating concordance, we focused on
GO biologicalproeess enrichment proﬁles(Table S7).
One of the strong eoncordanees was observed with 5- ﬂuorouridine (0.42), an FDA— approved
anticancer drug that is thought to also act by two mechanisms :i) inhibiting thymidylate
synthetase and ii) through metabolism into cytotoxic ribonucleotides and deoxyribonucleotides
that can be incorporated into DNA and RNA (Table 3)[14]. In addition to being incorporated in
DNA and RNA, we and others have shown that the drug has been shown to inhib it the essential
rlbonuelease activity of the exosome eomplex[28].Similarly, earmo fur, a derivative 0f5-
ﬂuorouraeil, displays a concordance 0f0.34. A similar concordance is seen with S-ﬂuoroeytosine
(S-FC), whose activity is identical to 5-ﬂu0r0uraeil(5-FU).Finally, 8-meth0xyps0ralen, a DNA-
damaging a gent, that, upon photoactivation, conjugates and forms covalent bonds with DNA,
shows a congruence 0f0.32. This compound causes the formation ofboth mono functional
(addition to a single strand of DNA) and bifunetional adduets (crosslinking of p soralen to both
strands of DNA) that ultimately results in cell death.

demonstrated to be efﬁcient for detoxification of a variety 0fce11s.Diallyl disulfide and related

survivalin the presence of increased reactive oxygen species (ROS)[29].
In the case of the heterozygous collection, we found significant GO enrichments for the
following categories :lipid metabolism, DNA catabolism and regulation 0ftranslati0n and post-
translational modiﬁcation (sp eeiﬁcally protein pho sphorylation)(Figure 3). As expected (based
on previous studies of the heterozygous collection), both the number of genes as sociated with
FDs and the number of enriched categories are considerably smaller than those derived from the
homozygous colleeti0n[30].This likely re ﬂeets two related phenomena :First, genes, that when
deleted in heterozygotes are sensitive to spaceﬂight, encode proteins that participate in the
pathways identified in the homozygous collection, where the ﬁtness defect is stronger because
the gene is eompletelyabsentSecond, none of these heterozygote strains encode a direct target of
the perturbatio 11.
Intere stingly, when we searched for drugpro ﬁles with high concordance with the
spaceﬂightpro ﬁles derived from the heterozygous collection, we detected modest concordance
with two human chemotherapeutics, mitoxanthrone (concordance = 0.19) and Epirubicin
(congruence 0.142). Both of the se a gents damage DNA by intercalating into the DNA double
20

"21","helix and also by stabilizing the eleavable complex that is the substrate of topoisomerase II[31-
33].
Conclusio ns
The experiments presented here represent a proo f of principle for conducting full genome
environmental screens in spaceﬂight using robust hardware that can recapitulate a full
automation suite With environmental control in the space of a small suite ase.The performance
of this platform is signiﬁcant for spaceﬂight studies and promises to enable terrestrial
experiments in extreme environments that Will have direct application to microbial
bioprocessing for manufacturing, alternative fuel development and basic research. The results
from these experiments suggest that spaceﬂight has subtle but signiﬁcant effects on core
cellular processes including growth control Via RNA and ribosomalbio genesis, metabolism,
modification and decay pathways. Furthermore, significant roles for DNA repair and
replication, response to pH signaling, control of gene expression, and mitochondrial function
were 0bserved.The yeast ehemogenetieanalysis 0f spaceﬂight samples presented here strongly
implicates DNA and RNA damage as the major ground based analogs of spaceﬂight
stress.Give11 the unique, and substantial radiation exposure in space, this is consistent With
major radiation— mediated effectsUnfortunately a 1g control 011 188 that might have allowed
better discrimination between the contributions of space radiation versus the effects of
microgravity 0n yeast responses was not available to us at this timeCurrent 011- going experts
are designed explore these effects and dissect them from other potentially confounding
variablesThe high concordance t0 the pro ﬁle induced by diallyl disulﬁde suggests
increased glutathione S-transferase, binding of electrophilie toxins, increased reactive oxygen

"22","species and change in redox state.These pathways, Which are required for survival in
spaceﬂight, can guide future experiments in two ﬁmdamental ways: ﬁrst by suggesting
environmental modiﬁcations that can bolster cellular and organismal integrity by avoiding
ﬁthher stress to these pathways, and secondly, by identifying drug stresses that can exacerb ate
these pathway requirements in an effort to control pathological cell growth in the case of
proliferative diseases.
