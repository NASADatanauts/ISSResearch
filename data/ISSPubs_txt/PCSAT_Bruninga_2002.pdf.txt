Abstract
PCsat was designed. and. built. as a student jproject EN: the [H3 Naval
Academy and launched on 29 Sept 2001 on the Kodiak Star mission as an
experimental communications payload to Ixﬂ: only introduce students to
space systems engineering, but also to begin a series of experiments in
low cost spacecraft telemetry system and data communications for mobile
satellite users. An additional unique feature of PCsat was the
integration of multiple worldwide Internet linked ground stations
allowing around the world access to satellite telemetry and
communications live from anywhere.
PCsat was a complete success and it has been used by thousands of users
in its first 9 months of flight. It has validated the viability of our
using off—the—shelf AX.25 for all Telemetry Command and Control as well
as supporting a bent—pipe mission. As our first satellite, we have a
lot of lessons learned and experiences with spacecraft operations and
many ideas for the future. This paper sumarizes the design details for
PCsat and highlights of the first year in space including what we have
learned and what new experiments we want to do on our next
communications mission.
