We develop a high—preoision model for relativistic observables of the Atomic Clock Ensemble

- $511 I. INTRODUCTION
: F4 The Atomic Clock Ensemble in Space (ACES) experiment is developed by the BSA1 and CNES2, to be ﬂown on
. > , the International Space Station (188) in 2017—18. The ACES experimental package consists of two atomic Clocks: the
: Q - cold—atom Clock PHARAO3 (developed by CNES ID and a space hydrogen maser (SHM, developed by SpectraTime
. F4 8A4 ED. The experiment Will be attached to the external payload facility on the European Columbus module on the
' O - space station. Associated With ACES is the European Laser Timing (ELT) experiment E].
: Q Placed in a microgravity environment on the 188, the expected overall frequency stability of PHARAO is 1 X 10—16
- O . (see Table l. The short—term frequency stability of PHARAO Will be evaluated by direct comparison to the SHM.

. v—4 The medium term frequency instability Will be evaluated by direct comparison to ultra—stable ground Clocks. The
' V3 - long—term stability Will be determined by on—board comparison to PHARAO.
: F: To compare time and freouenoy between various ground Clocks, ACES Will use a two—way microwave system called
' > - the microwave link (MWL)q.—m (Tablel. Given the anticipated accuracy of the MWL, ACES is expected to provide
: ° “-1 absolute synchronization of ground Clock time scales With an uncertainty of 100 ps. The experiment Will also enable
- >5 . comparison of primary frequency standards With accuracy at the 10—16 level. Additionally, high precision time transfer
: C3 Will be facilitated by the BLT experiment, With overall planned accuracy of 50 ps, and a per—pass space—to—ground
' ' ' Clock comparison precision of 4 ps.

With an atomic Clock offering such accurate performance in the microgravity environment, ACES Will conduct sev—
eral tests of fundamental physics. Speciﬁcally, ACES Will conduct gravitational redshift measurements, test Lorentz—
invariance, and it Will search for possible variations in the ﬁne structure constant. It is expected that the uncertainty
on the gravitational redshift measurement Will be below 50 X 10—6 for an integration time corresponding to one 188
pass. However, With the ultimate accuracy of PHARAO, ACES may reach an uncertainty level of 2 X 10—6. Measure—
ments can reach a precision level of 60/0 2 10—10 in the search for anisotropies of the speed of light. Time variations
of the ﬁne structure constant, oz, can be measured at the level of precision (35/05 < 1 X 10—16 yr‘l.

To reach its science objectives, ACES Will rely on the time and frequency stability of the SHM, PHARAO, the

MWL and Clocks over one ISS pass. The most important component of a Clock is an oscillator, the periodic oscillation
of which has to be generated, maintained and read out by suitable means. As it is known, an oscillator on board
the ISS is subject to many Classical disturbances. In addition to relativistic gravity, Clock performance is affected by
nongravitational forces external to the station and also by the dynamical environment on the ISS. This environment is
rather complex and includes forces and torques due to causes such as extended structure Vibrations, frequent thruster
ﬁrings, spacecraft docking and undocking, on—going human activity, thermal imbalance, outgassing, etc. Some of
these effects directly impact the trajectory of the ISS and consequently, the relativistic timing and frequency transfer
observables of ACES. Other effects will directly impact the Clock stability by producing unwanted acceleration noise
at the clocks location. These effects should be accounted for in a Classical description of an oscillator subjected to
various sources of acceleration noise.

Although a Newtonian formulation of the coordinate reference systems for the ISS is readily available 1, it is not
sufﬁcient for ACES. The requirement to formulate models of ACES observables within the framework of Einstein’s
general theory of relativity was recognized early on during mission development -, m. ACES will rely on accurate
navigation of the ISS and accurate timing measurements between the station and ground—based terminals. The
experiment will require precision timing of all critical events related to the transmission and reception of various
microwave and optical signals used on ACES for time and frequency transfer, as well as navigation. The resulting
time series of high accuracy radio—metric and opto—metric data will provide the time transfer accuracy that is needed
to perform tests of fundamental physics with ACES. Based on the anticipated performance of hardware that will
be involved in the ACES experiment, the models for the ACES observables must be accurate at the level of 1 ps
and 6 f / f 2 1 X 10—16 for time and frequency transfers, correspondingly. We will use these numbers in developing
relativistic models for observables on the ACES experiment.

To describe the dynamics around the Earth we will introduce several reference frames, each with its own coordinate
Chart. In the immediate Vicinity of the Earth we can introduce a set of local coordinates deﬁned in the frame
associated with the Earth: The origin of the Geocentric Coordinate Reference System (GCRS) is the Earth’s center
of mass. Positions of ground stations are given with resoect to another terrestrial coordinate system, the Topocentric
Coordinate Reference System (TCRS; see also Ref. i.) We also consider the Spacecraft Coordinate Reference
System (SCRS), the origin of which is ﬁxed at the ISS’ center of mass. We also use ACES Coordinate Reference
System (ACES) associated with the ACES package. The deﬁnition and properties of the TCRS, to ether with useful
details on relativistic time—keeping in the solar system are given in m. The SCRS was discussed in h in the context
of the GRAIL mission. Here we introduce the SCRS on the ISS and we deﬁne the ACRS together with appropriate
coordinate transformations.

Previous studies of ACES El, I, I, offered relativistic models of the basic experimental observables: time and
frequency transfer. These efforts treated the ISS as a free—falling platform, moving on a geodesic worldline in the
GCRS. However, the motion of the soace station is subject to nongravitational forces that are present in the near—
Earth environment (as discussed in h), including atmospheric drag, solar radiation pressure and thermo—elastic
cycling. As the shape of the space station is complex, its center of mass does not coincide with its center with respect
to nongravitational forces. This mismatch results in torques that affect the orientation of the ISS. Also, the presence
of these dissipative forces results in the ISS constantly loosing altitude, in apparent Violation of naive models of
energy—momenturn conservation. Furthermore, as the ISS orbits the Earth, its extended structure vibrates and ﬂexes,
resulting in a complex proﬁle of nongravitational acceleration noise on the station.

This paper is organized as follows: In Section-we discuss the conventional deﬁnitions of the GCRS and TCRS,
including representations of the metric tensor in these reference systems and the coordinate transformations between
them. We also present the equations of motion for Earth—orbiting spacecraft and light—time equations. We pay special
attention to contributions by various nongravitational forces acting on the ISS and the ACES package, including
atmospheric drag and solar radiation pressure. In Section-we present the coordinate reference frames important
for the ACES experiment, namely the SCRS and the ACRS, again including representations of the metric tensor and
coordinate transformations, at a level of accuracy appropriate for ACES. In Section-we discuss the formulation
of the relativistic observables of the ACES experiment. We present models for time and frequency transfer and
evaluate the navigational requirements needed to fulﬁl the science objectives of ACES. We conclude with a set of

II. REFERENCE FRAMES AND THE EQUATIONS OF MOTION

A properly deﬁned set of coordinate reference frames simpliﬁes the discussion of the observables of an experiment.
Because of its high—precision science objectives and its deployment on the ISS, ACES presents a set of unique features.
One of the primary Challenges is the presence of various nongravitational forces acting on the experimental payload.
In this section we present descriptions of various reference frames relevant to ACES. We pay particular attention to
the dynamical environment relevant to each of these reference frames. Although our analysis is motivated by the
ACES experiment, the results obtained here are relevant to other missions that Will use precision clocks to reach their
science objectives 1.

The coordinate systems that represent the ACES experiment are each Characterized by a unique set of harmonic
potentials including the scalar potential w and the vector potential w)‘. Using these harmonic potentials, we represent
the metric tensor of a reference frame in the f0rm5,

For the standard non—rotating GCRS, the scalar gravitational potential is formed as a linear superposition of the
gravitational potential UE 0f the isolated Earth, and the tidal potential utﬁdal of all other solar system bodies:

11113 = UE + uEidal + O(c_4). (2)

5 The notational conventions used in this paper are as follows. Latin indices (m, n, ...) are space—time indices that run from 0 t0 3. Greek
indices 04, ﬂ, are spatial indices that run from 1 t0 3. In case of repeated indices in products, the Einstein summation rule applies:
e.g., ambm : 2:120 ambm. Bold letters denote spatial (three—dimensional) vectors: e.g., a : (a1,a2, a3), b : (b1,b2,b3). The dot is
used to indicate the Euclidean inner product of spatial vectors: e.g., (a- b) : a1b1 —|— agbg —|— a3b3. Latin indices are raised and lowered
using the metric gm”. The Minkowski (ﬂat) space—time metric is given by 7mm : diag(1,—1,—1,—1), so that vuyaWJV : —(a- b). We
use powers of the inverse of the speed of light, 0—1, and the gravitational constant, G as bookkeeping devices for order terms: in the
10W-Velocity (2) << 0), weak-ﬁeld (GM/r << 02) approximation, a quantity of O(c‘2) 2 O(G), for instance, has a magnitude comparable
to 212/02 0r GM/CQT‘. The notation O(ak, be) is used to indicate that the preceding expression is free of terms containing powers of a
greater than or equal to k, and powers of b greater than or equal to E.

At the level of accuracy required by the ACES experiment, the tidal potential ugdal can be given in terms of
Newtonian contributions only (mostly due the Moon and the Sun):

where U5 is the Newtonian gravitational potential of body I), rbE is the vector connecting the center of mass of body
I) with that of the Earth, and VUb denotes the gradient of the potential. The potential can be expanded to higher
order terms if necessary.
The vector harmonic potential 111%} captures the contribution of the Earth’s rotation, deﬁned as:
GM _ _

Eq. explicitly accounts only for the largest rotational moment, SE, which is the Earth’s spin moment (angular
momentum per unit of mass), SE 2 9.8 X 108 m2/s.

Although ACES data will be transmitted, received, and analyzed in GCRS, using TCRS, SCRS, and ACRS, we
still need access to a global inertial reference frame to account for the presence of the solar system bodies. For
these purposes, we need one global coordinate Chart, deﬁned for the inertial reference frame that covers the entire
solar system. The Solar System Baryoentric Coordinate Reference System (BCRS) has its origin at the solar system
barycenter. It is a convenient reference system for the purpose of describing the motion of the Earth, the Moon, and
the Sun , whose dynamics will be important for ACES. In particular, the ellipticity of Earth’s orbit introduces
annual variations of solar gravity potential at the location of the ACES Clock which must be accounted for, as it was
done, for instance, in 1. Otherwise, GCRS fully satisﬁes the needs of the ACES experiment.

A. Terrestrial reference frames

The formulation of the GCRS treats the Earth’s trajectory in the solar system as being determined solely by
gravitational forces — a well justiﬁed assumption. Indeed, the largest nongravitational force acting on the Earth is
that due to the solar radiation pressure, which is responsible for acceleration of 1.95 X 10—16 In/s2, which is negligible
for the ACES experiment. Further details on the formulation of the GCRS are in m.

In Ref. 1, we showed that the transformations between the harmonic coordinates of the GCRS {1107”} E (ct, X) and
a non—rotating body—centrio reference system {3/31} E (eta, ya) associated with a body a may be written as below:

taO
—2 1 — 1 2 —4
X : Xao + ya + C {§Va0 (Vac) ' ya) _ ngtya + §aa0ya _ ya(ya ' 8.00)} + O(C )7 (7)
where Xao = Xa0(t) is the vector that connects the origin of the {xm} reference system with that of the {yan}.

The quantity ngt in (Elk. is a combination of potentials evaluated at the origin of a particular reference frame.
This combination consists of i) the Newtonian gravitational potential (including, if necessary, multipole corrections)
due to all bodies in the solar system other than body a, at the location of body a, and ii) a contribution from
nongravitational forces acting on the body a. Next, VaO E Xao is the geocentric velocity of the body a and aaO E
jiao = —ngxt + O(c‘2) its Newtonian acceleration due to ngt, i.e., the combined effect from gravitational and
nongravitational forces acting on the body.

Introducing ra : X — Xao, the inverses of the transformations (13%. can be written aS .7 m

Note that the 0—4 terms in (El), are of the order of N vaS/c‘l 2 4.3 X 10—19 and are therefore negligible for the
ACES experiment. For complete post—Newtonian form of transformations (IED—(El), consult Ref. 1.

Applying the coordinate transformations (13%. together with the external potentials ngt and acceleration aa,
from the metric tensor of the GCRS given by one can derive the metric tensor 93m of the non—rotating coordinate
reference system associated with an object a (see details in m):

Where wa and w: are the scalar and vector harmonic potentials representing gravity and inertia in a particular
coordinate reference system associated With the body a.

The topocentric coordinate reference system, TCRS, can be obtained by transforming the GCRS metric gin using

Where yC is the position vector in the GCRS of a particular ground station. Note that UE(yC) must be treated as
the potential of an extended body and include a multipolar expansion With sufﬁcient accuracy, taking into account
time—dependent terms due to tidal effects on the elastic Earth. The corresponding acceleration is ac = —ngxt(yc).

The proper time Tc, kept by a Clock C located at the GCRS coordinate position rc(t), and moving With the
coordinate velocity VC : drC/dt : [wE >< rc], Where wE is the angular rotational velocity of the Earth at C, is
determined by

W = 1 — 0—2 [§wErC(6’) sm 6’ + UE(rC)] + O(3.89 x 10 ), (12)
Where 6’ is the latitude of C and the error bound is set by the lunar tides at the location of the tracking station.

The largest contribution to ch/dt comes from the velocity and mass monopole terms, Which are estimated to
produce an effect of the order of 0—2 (%w%R%3 —1— GME/RE) N 6.97 X 10—10. The quadrupole term produces contribution
of the order of 0—2GMEJ2/(2RE) N 3.77 X 10—13, Which is large enough to be included in the model. Contributions
of other zonal harmonics ranging from —c_23GMEJ4/(8RE) N 4.23 X 10—16 (from J4) t0 0—25GMEJ5/(16RE) N
1.18 X 10—16 (from J5). Although individual contributions of these and other terms are quite small to warrant their
place in the model, their cumulative effect may be noticeable at the level of up to 3 X 10—15.

In practice, time measurements are based on averages of Clock and frequency measurements on the Earth surface
1. For this purpose, the time coordinate called Terrestrial Time (TT) is deﬁned. TT is related to TOG: t linearly

in general relativity. Lastly, am}, is the contribution of nongravitational forces (to be discussed in Sec. -.

As expected, Newtonian acceleration has the largest effect on Earth—orbiting spacecraft. For satellites in the vicinity
of the Earth (up to GEO orbit) the terms in Eq. can be evaluated With respect to the main Newtonian acceleration,
as follows: The Schwarzschild terms (second line) are a few parts in 1010 (high orbits) to 109 (10W orbits) smaller;
the effects of Lense—Thirring precession (frame—dragging, ﬁrst term on the third line) and the geodesic (de Sitter)
precession (last term on the third line) are about 1011 to 1012 smaller. The main effect of the Schwarzschild terms
is a secular shift in the argument of perigee While the Lense—Thirring and de Sitter terms cause a precession 0f the
orbital plane at a rate of the order of 0.8 mas/yr (geostationary) to 180 mas/yr (10W orbit) for Lense—Thirring and 19
mas/yr (independent of orbital altitude) for de Sitter. The Lense—Thirring terms are less important than the geodesic
terms for orbits higher than LAGEOS (altitude above 6,000 km) and more important for orbits lower than LAGEOS.

1. Gravitatianal eﬁects 0n the [SS Orbit

Eq. consists of seven terms, the ﬁrst of Which represents the largest force acting on the 188, the contribution
of the Earth gravitational monopole (N 8.69 m/s2). The second term arises from treating the Earth as an extended
body, and represents the contribution from the spherical harmonics, contributing a few parts in 10—3 (for J2) to
a few parts in 10—6 — 10—7 (for harmonics of higher order) relative to the monopole term. The third term is the
post—Newtonian contribution from the Schwarzschild metric, contributing up to 2.85 X 10—9 m/s2, including also the
contribution due to the eccentricity 0f the ISS orbit (€Iss N 0.0006), Which is N 1.37 X 10—11 m/s2. The fourth term
represents the Lense—Thirring precession due to the Earth’s angular momentum, SE 2 9.8 X 108 m2/s, amounting to
an acceleration of the order of N 2.15 X 10—10 m/s2. The ﬁfth term is due to the contribution of solar gravity on the
ISS orbit, With a magnitude of N 4.56 X 10—11 m/s2. The sixth term represents the tidal potential (mostly due to the
Earth and the Sun). The tidal acceleration due to the moon is of the order of N 5.85 X 10—7 m/s2 Whereas for the
sun it is N 2.69 X 10—7 m/s2. Finally, nongravitational forces are captured by the symbol aNg, and Will be discussed
in the next subsection.

The relativistic geocentric equations of motion of a satellite that are recommended by the IERS may include
the contribution from the relativistic quadrupole moment of the Earth at the 1/02 order. It is estimated that the
corresponding Jg—term would contribute N 2.85 X 10—11 m/s2 for the 188. As such, the relativistic effects of the Earth’s
oblateness are small for the ISS and may be neglected in the analysis.

The independent variable of the satellite equations of motion may be, depending on the time transformation being
used, either TT 0r TCG. Although the distinction is not essential to compute this relativistic correction, it is important
to account for it properly in the Newtonian part of the acceleration.

2. Non—gmm'tatz'onal farces acting on the [SS

The trajectories of Earth—orbiting spacecraft can be signiﬁcantly affected by nongravitational forces. Atmospheric
drag is especially signiﬁcant for the 188, Which has a very large surface area compared to its weight (i.e., it has a
10W ballistic coefﬁcient), While moving in a 10W Earth orbit. Another signiﬁcant contribution is due to solar radiation
pressure and related torques. Other, lesser contributions include radiation pressure from the Earth, interactions With
the Earth’s magnetic ﬁelds, outgassing, thermo—elastic deformations and extended structure vibrations of the 188‘.
However, for the 188 these contributions are small compared to the effect of the main nongravitational forces and Will
be addressed elsewhere.

The 188 is orbiting at an altitude of N 400 km. It is constantly losing altitude due to atmospheric drag. The station
is regularly boosted to prevent atmospheric re—entry. The atmospheric drag force on the station acts in the opposite
direction of its velocity vector and is responsible for deceleration given by

8‘ad : _%patmv2nva (16)
Where Cd is the drag coefﬁcient, patm is the air density at the station location, ’0 is the station’s velocity With respect to
the atmosphere, nv = V / v is the unit vector in the direction of velocity, and A is the cross—sectional area of the station
in the direction of its motion through the atmosphere. The drag coefﬁcient and cross—sectional area are dependent on
the geometric shape and orientation of the station. These are generally determined through experiment 0r numerical
simulations. Earth orbiting satellites typically have very high drag coefﬁcients Cd in the range of about 2 t0 4.

"
"7","7

The atmospheric density patm varies by up to two orders of magnitude as it responds to solar and geomagnetic
activity 1. The MSISE—90 model of the Earth’s upper atmosphere6 provides patm as a function of solar activity. At
the altitude of 400 km, the atmospheric density is expected to be in the range patm = (3.89 — 50.4) X 10—12 kg/m3,
corresponding to mean to extreme high solar activity.

To estimate the magnitude of aad, we use the current mass of the 1887 m = mISS : 4.2 X 105 kg, see Table. The
largest cross—sectional area, based on the size of the solar panels, can be estimated at A g 8 X (36.5 In X 11.6 m) :
3, 387 m2. We use Cd : 2 for the 188 used in orbit analysis8. Substituting these values in Eq. -, we obtain

laadl 2 (1.8 — 23.9) X i()—6 m/s2, (17)
These values9 (corresponding to mean and extreme high solar activity) are approximately three orders of magnitude
larger than relativistic accelerations in the motion of the ISS.

Computational models for solar radiation pressure are usually developed prior to launch. These models can be used
to compute the acceleration as a function of spacecraft orientation and solar distance:

2 fQA
asr(7°) : CTn—T2HQ7 (18)
where f® = 1, 367 W/(m2AU2) is the solar constant at 1 AU, rig is the unit vector in the direction of the Sun and 7°
is the distance between the spacecraft and the Sun. Using the physical parameters of the ISS and its orbit, an upper
limit of Eq. can be obtained:
lasrl g 7.3 X 10—8 m/s2, (19)
which is nearly 108 times smaller than the Newtonian acceleration and over N 102 to 103 times smaller than the
deceleration due to atmospheric drag. However, solar radiation pressure will in general perturb the eccentricity, which
may have to be counteracted by actively controlling the orbit. This acceleration, if not accounted for, will result in
an error in the estimated radial position of the 188. Over a time interval At this error is 67° 2 %6a A752, where 6a
is the unmodeled acceleration. If the effect of solar radiation pressure was completely unmodeled, over a period of
At = 103 s, the position error due to solar pressure would be N004 In, which is negligible over the time scale of one
orbital revolution.
3. Equation 0f mation app’mp’rz'ate for the [SS

The orbit of the ISS (hence, ACES) is presumed known to an accuracy of ~10 In El, 1. Atmospheric drag corrupts
the orbital estimates for the ISS, making it impractical to keep terms below N 1 X 10—7 m/s2. Consequently, we may
neglect all the relativistic terms (O(c‘2) and smaller), i.e., terms three through ﬁve in 1-D, truncating the equation
of motion to its Newtonian form:

Knowing the time that it takes for a signal to travel between the Earth and a spacecraft is required both for
radio—metric navigation and for clock synchronization. Given a time of transmission t1 and a time of reception t2, the

time delay that, in the case of ACES, is all due to the Earth (contributions from the Moon and the Sun are
negligible). Between the ISS and the ground, the Shapiro time delay is 0.5—3.1 mm (i.e., 1.8—10.4 ps). The next
order term in this expression would be the one due to Earth’s quadrupole Whose presence extends the standard
formulation given in l, m. The largest contribution from the quadruple Will be for a ground—based receiver. It
amounts to N 3 am (or 0.01 ps) and is negligible for ACES, providing the corresponding bound in -.

These computations are applicable When signals travel in a vacuum. This is not the case for signals between ground
stations and spacecraft in lOW—Earth orbit. These signals experience propagation details due to the Charged particle
environment in the exosphere and, most notably, due to the oroperties and composition of the troposhere. There is
extensive literature available on this topic (see., e.g., ., El, ), a comprehensive discussion of Which is beyond the
scope of our present paper.

D. Coordinate systems on the ISS

Observables on board the 188 are naturally described in a coordinate system (the SCRS) associated With the space
station’s center of mass. However, this Choice must be scrutinized for a precision experiment that is intended to detect
minute gravitational effects, if the experiment is not located at the station’s center of mass, as it is subject to tidal
accelerations as well as nongravitational forces, such as structure Vibrations. The ACES experiment is some distance
away. For this reason, we also introduce the ACES Coordinate Reference System (ACES), and use the coordinate
transformations between the SCRS and the ACRS to estimate the relativistic corrections due to the location of ACES.
We begin, though, by establishing the relationship between terrestrial and station reference frames.

1. Coordinate transformations between GCRS and SCRS

To determine the metric tensor for the SCRS, we perform the coordinate transformation between the GCRS
coordinates, {30%} E ($0 : ct, X), and coordinates of the non—rotating ISS—Centric reference system {gigs} E (075133, y)
associated With the center of mass of the 188. With the help of (13%., these transformations are taking the form:

Where X133 2 X13305) is the geocentric position vector of the ISS and VISS E X133 its geocentric velocity. The geocentric
acceleration of the ISS, aIss E X133, is given by Eq. -, Which is accurate to N 1 X 10—7 m/s2 and accounts for
Newtonian gravity of the Earth together With the contribution from the atmospheric drag.

Where VB is the contribution of extended Earth evaluated at the center of mass of the 188, as given by Eq. at

% Z 1 — 0—2{%Viss + UE + Z % (3(nbE 'XISS)2 — Kiss) + (3188 ' W} + C(54) (27)
675E 6E

The ﬁrst term in curly braces in Eq. is due to the orbital velocity of the 188. The actual velocity of the
188 at the end of a time interval 675 may be written as the sum of the initial velocity VISS(t) and perturbations
from gravitational (6Vgrav(t) = Lt+6tagrav(t’)dt’) and nongravitational (6VNg(t) = ﬁ+6taNg(t’)dt’) accelerations:
VISS(t + 675) = VISS(t) + 6Vgrav(t) + 6VNg(t). Writing V1880“ + 675) = Vlss(t) + 6VgraV(t) and replacing aNg(t) With
a constant value aNG representing the maximum nongravitational acceleration allows us to estimate le2SS — ”U?SSO‘ SJ
2(VISSO 'aNg)6t+a12\IG6t2. The two largest terms in aNG are given by Eqs. and -. Given ”01330 N 7.67 km/s, over
a time interval 675 = 103 s, the contributions of these terms is given by, respectively, 20_2(VISSO . aad)6t SJ 4.1 X 10—15
and 20—2(VISSO 'asr)6t g 1.3 X 10‘”, Whereas the contribution of the term o< aim for that time interval is N (9(10_20).
Therefore, we estimate that atmospheric drag contributes %C_2(VISSO 'aad) g 2.04 X 10—15 to Clock olesynchronization,
Whereas the contributions of other nongravitational accelerations are negligible.

The monopole term in the Newtonian potential of the Earth at the ISS location VB is responsible for a con—
tribution of O_2GME/TISS 2 6.55 X 10—10. We estimate that the quadrupole term produces a contribution of
0—2GMEJ2R%/(2T%SS) 2 3.14>< 10—13. Contributions of J4 and J5 are given by —c_23GMEJ4R4E/(8r15ss) N 3.12>< 10—16
and J5 is 0—25GMEJ5Rg/(16r1788) N 7.68 X 10‘”, Which are signiﬁcant. Although individual contributions of other
zonal harmonics (i.e, Jk, k 2 7) are small, their cumulative effect may be noticeable at the level up to 61330 2 3 X 10—16.

The constant rate 61330 would likely be absorbed in other terms during clock synchronization. What is important
is the variability in the entire error term 6133(75) = 61330 + 6613305), Where the amplitude of the variable term 6613305) is
due to seasonal Changes in the Earth hydrosphere, crust, etc. and is expected to be of the order of 6613305) N 3 X 10‘”,
resulting in the ultimate uncertainty in ACES Clock instabilities 6(dTA/dt)elss at that level. Thus, the mission may
consider including the higher spherical harmonics in the model for Earth gravity potential. Conversely, the ACES
data could be used for accurate determination and study of the lowest spherical harmonics (i.e, Jk, k E [2, 10]), Which
could be a valuable scientiﬁc result for geodesy.

The next 1/02 term in is the sum of the Newtonian tides due to other bodies (mainly the Sun and the Moon)
at the origin of the SRCS. These terms are small for the 188 being of the order of 4.40 X 10—17 for the Moon and
2.02 X 10—17 for the Sun, and, thus, they may be omitted for ACES.

The last 1/02 term in is the acceleration—inoluceol redshift for Clocks on the 188. Although this term vanishes at
the origin of the SRCS, ACES Will not be located at the center of mass of the 188, but at some distance of on = 30 m
away from it. Such an offset leads to acceleration—inoluceol redshift between a ﬁctitious Clock at the origin of the SGRS
and the atomic Clocks of the ACES package. The dominant term in a133, given by 318807 yields a surprisingly large
contribution: C_2(alss0 .yAO) 2 2.91 X 10—15. Contributions from nongravitational accelerations are (9(10_20) and
thus can be safely neglected.

As a result, the temporal part of coordinate transformation (also given by -) takes the following form:

dtlss _ 1 —2 1 2 — —17
7 — — C {§VISSO -1— (VISSO ' Vad) + UE + (8.1830 ' 37)} + 0(44 X 10 ), (28)
Where the accuracy bound is set by the omitted contribution from the lunar and solar tides (third 1/02 term in -).

"
"10","10

We also evaluate the 1/c2 terms present in the spatial transformations -. Taking, for example, the term with
the Newtonian potential we determine that its contribution is of the order of QC 0—2713on 3 c_2(GME / 7133)on =
6.55 X 10—10yA0. Even for the largest separation on the ISS, yIss = 120 m, this term is only N 7.86 X 10—8 m. As the
uncertainty in the geocentric position of the ACES package is expected to be N1 m, this value is exceedingly small.
The other 1/c2 terms in are also negligible. Thus, the entire package of 1/c2 terms in may be omitted.

As a result, the spatial part of the coordinate transformations between GCRS and SCRS takes a simple form:

x : x133 + y + 0(6.55 >< 10—10)y. (29)

Compared to ""—, the coordinate transformations ""— have a much simpliﬁed form, but are accurate

enough to describe the ACES observables and will be used them for this purpose in the reminder of the paper.
2. Metric tensor of the SCRS 0n the [SS

Using the formalism of Eq. ., the metric tensor of the SCRS can be expressed in the harmonic coordinates of this
SCRS, {gigs} E ct s, y), using scalar and vector potentials that incorporate both gravitational and nongravitational
contributions @Jﬁﬂ:

wlss = UISS + Uisicslal + (aNG ' Y) + C(53): (30)
M
WISS = —§7°—12s:[nlss >< SE] — 1_1()(BY(Y'é-NG) — élNoy2) + O(C_2)- (31)

Of the terms present in Eq. -, contributions to clock desynchronization by the gravitational potential due to the
self—gravity of the 188 at a distance 3/ = lyl = 30 m away from that point are given by 6(dTACEs/dt)lss = O_2U1ss :
0—2Gm1ss/ly1ssl 2 1.0 X 10—23, which is negligible. Similarly, contributions from the tidal term, 6 (dTACES / dt)tida1 =
C—2u%g%al : c_2{GME [3(n1ss . y)2 _ y2l/2Ti5ss + O(y3, 0—2)} 2 1.3 X 10—20, can also be dropped. Finally, estimating
the contributions from nongravitational forces by using the largest nongravitational force, atmospheric drag, we ﬁnd
that the magnitude of these contributions, 6(dTACES/dt)NG = c_2(aNG . y) N 613(1on 2 8.2 X 10—21 means that the
third term can also be omitted.

As the center of ﬁgure of the 188 does not coincide with its center of mass, the nongravitational forces may result
in torques applied to the entire soace station, changing the attitude orientation of the 188. The 188 is maintained in
a “torque equilibrium attitude” i, which means that the cumulative effect of torque over a full orbit is near zero,
but during an orbit, signiﬁcant accelerations may be present. To estimate the order of magnitude of such torques,
we model the space station as a spherical, homogeneous m : 4.2 X 105 kg mass of R = 30 m radius, with moment of
inertia I : 2mR2/5, and assume that atmospheric drag, the largest nongravitational force acting on the station, is
displaced by up to 1 m relative to the center—of—mass at some point during the orbit. The torque, then, is given by
7' = r X (maad) g 10 N ' m, and the rotational acceleration is oz : 7/] N 10—7s_2. At 3/ = 30 m, this translates into
an acceleration of atrq N 2.0 X 10—6 m/s2, contributing 6(dTACES/dt)trq SJ c_2atrqy N 10—21, which is negligible.

The space station also rotates. Normally it completes one revolution per orbit, but higher rotation rates are also
possible. However, even at the unrealistically high rotation rate of w = 10 /s, acf : wgrquO 2 0.009 m/s2, which
would contribute to the frequency comparison of the ACES clocks at the level of 6(d7‘ACES /dt)cf = (atr01 . y A0) / c2 2
3.05 X 10—18, still small compared to our accuracy goal for ACES.

In Eq. -, the ﬁrst term contributes 0—4GME([HISS >< SE] 'Ulss)/(27°I2SS) g 4 X 10—21, which is negligible. The
second term, a gravitomagnetic term that results in the dragging of inertial frames and a clock redshift, is due to
temporal variability of the nongravitational accelerations. Taking am 2 aadwlss, where wIss is the orbital frequency
of the 188, this contribution amounts to C_4(4aadw1ssyio’01ss) / 5 g 1.9 X 10—35, which is exceedingly small.

As a result, the SCRS at the position of the ACES package on the 188 may be treated as inertial, with the metric
tensor given by the Minkowski space—time with insigniﬁcant deviations due to non—inertial contributions:

95%8 = 1 + O(3.1 >< 10—18) E 1, gags : 0(6.3 >< 10—16) E 0, gas; 2 Wow + O(3.1 >< 10—18) E M5. (32)
This Minkowski metric covers the entire space station and may be used to analyze and process the data for the
ACES experiment. In -, the error terms for temporal, gags, and spatial, 9:838, components provided by a sudden
nongravitational torques changing the attitude of the 188 by 1 O /s, while the error bound for the mixed terms, gas, is
due to omitted contribution from the Earth’s spin moment. As a result, to a good approximation, the metric tensor
of the SCRS can be taken in the form of the Minkowski metric -, which is sufﬁcient to describe the relativistic
observables of the ACES experiment. The SCRS may be treated as a locally inertial frame that covers the entire 188.
Together with the coordinate transformations ""— the metric tensor completes formulation of the SCRS.

E. ACES Coordinate Reference System (ACRS)

To describe the observables 0f the ACES experiment, we need to introduce the ACRS coordinate reference system
located at the center of mass of the ACES package. The coordinate transformation between the SCRS and the ACRS
will be given in a form similar to ""—2

15A
25138 = 25A + c_2{(vo . yA) +/ (§v3 +wﬁxt)dt§(} + O(c—4)tA, (33)

tAO

YIss YAo YA C 2V0 V0 YA wextyA + 2309A YA YA a0 0 7 ( )
where y A0 = y A0 (tlss) is the positional vector of the ACES package with respect to the SCRS, with lYAol : 30 m.
Also, VO = m and a0 = M are the velocity and acceleration of the ACRS as seen from the SCRS, correspondingly.
The “external” potential, EeAxt, is the potential due to the gravity of the ISS evaluated at the ACES location. Its

magnitude is EeAxt/c2 = Ulss/C2 g 1.0 X 10—23, making this term negligible.

The velocity V0 = M is mostly due to extended structure vibrations of the 188. If we assume that the ISS vibrates
at the ACES location at wvib = 10 Hz with the amplitude 6Vib = 0.1 m, this motion leads to a Vibrational velocity of
vvib = 6Vibwvib = 1 m/s, which will be responsible for a contribution of 5(dt1ss/th)vib = %C_2’031b = 5.56 X 10—18 t0
ACES Clock desynchronization. (As environmental factors on the 188 may increase the magnitude of this effect, it is
important to analyze it in more detail, which we plan to do this in a separate publication.)

Based on this analysis, we conclude that the coordinate transformations between the SCRS and the ACRS ""—
may be given as

75188 : tA -1— C—2(Vvib ' yA) + O(5.56 >< 10—18)tA, (35)

YIss : YAO + YA + 0(5-56 X 10—18)YA7 (36)

where the bound is set by the vibrations of the 188 at the location of the ACES package. As a result, the metric
tensor representing the ACRS has the nearly Minkowski form:

930 = 1 + O(i >< 10—16), 95; : O(i x 10—21), gfiﬁ : ”7&5 + O(l x 10—16). (37)

Furthermore, Eq. implies that the proper time of an atomic Clock at the origin of the ACRS is nearly equivalent
to the time of the SCRS, namely:

d7
—A : 1 + O(5.56 >< 10—18). (38)
dtlss

Using the coordinate transformations ""— between the SCRS and the GCRS, we can relate ACES proper time
to GCRS geocentric time, TCG. Dropping quadrupole terms from the expression as well as the acceleration—dependent
term C_2alss0 'yAO 2 (9(42 >< 10—18), we obtain

dTA 1 GME RE 2332 — r2
—:1——{lV2—l—V 'V +—(1 J[—]#)} (93X10_16. 39
dt c22A<Aad> TA +2“ 27% +< > <>

Clearly, may be obtained directly by deﬁning the ACRS Via a coordinate transformation between the GCRS
and ACRS. However, by introducing the hierarchy of reference systems GCRS—>SCRS—>ACRS, we were able to discuss
the appropriate gravitational and nongravitational forces and related torques at each step of these transformations.

Note that the accuracy of may be improved to O(4.4 X 10‘”) by including several terms with the gravitational
harmonics beyond J2. Such an improvement may be needed to be consistent with the ultimate ACES Clock accuracy,
which is expected to be at the level of 1 X 10—16 at 1 day.

Concluding, we emphasize that, contrary to our original expectations, the ACES coordinate reference system may
be treated as a quasi—inertial one. One can use the coordinate transformations and the metric tensor discussed in this
section to describe the relativistic observables 0f the ACES experiment. However, the proposed Space Optical Clock
(SOC) mission will require the introduction of a more accurate set of coordinate reference systems.

III. MODELING THE RELATIVISTIC OBSERVABLES FOR ACES

Now that we have successfully formulated all the coordinate systems and coordinate transformation rules required
to describe the ACES experiment and associated ground stations, we can proceed with modeling the timing and
frequency observables 0f ACES.

A. Timing observables
First, we consider the generic two—way scenario shown in Fig. representative of the European Laser Timing (ELT)
experiment Q, operating in conjunction with ACES. Depicted are the worldlines of two terminals, A (e.g., a ground
station) and B (the ACES experiment). Proper times of transmission and reception, time—stamped by local Clocks,
are recorded at both locations. Thus, a signal emitted at %A(t1) = 72A1 (where the tilde is used to indicate that
7‘ is a discrete data point in a measurement sequence, as distinguished from the continuous variable 7' representing
proper time) will be recorded at 7:131 = 72A1 + 673:, where 67‘]: captures the ﬁnite precision of the timestamp and
other instrumental uncertainties. We similarly introduce the time of the ﬁrst signal’s reception along worldline B,
ﬂg2 = 713052) +67% = 7:32 +67%, and the corresponding quantities for the return signal: 7:133 = 713053) +6711?) = 7:33 +67%
and 7K4 = 71054) + 67‘}; = 714 + 6731;. We assume that 67:3, 6731;, 67:13) and 67% are constant and known ahead of time
(through instrumental calibration) though in general, the emission and reception delays are different: 67‘]: 7E 67‘}; and
67% 7E 67%. For convenience, we introduce the following combinations corresponding to pseudoranges:
A?A1B2 : 7:132 — 7:317 A7:B3A4 I 7:34 — 7:133: (40)
A?A1A4 : f[1&4 — fZ1, A7:B2B3 = ?]33 — $132 (41)
These values are all functions of the coordinate time quadruplet of coordinate times {751, t2, t3, 754}. Using Eq. 1-D,
we can use these coordinate times to form the light travel times
A7512 = 752 — 751 = O_lRAB (X131, XA2), A7534 = 754 — 753 = O_lRAB (X133, XA4): (42)

positions along the two worldlines. Additionally, we can form the time intervals A7514 2 t4 — t1 and A7523 2 t3 — 752,
which correspond to the intervals of proper time measured by the Clocks on A and B .

synchronization of two Clocks i7-711

At = t3 — t1 = 5 (A2514 + A2523 + A2512 — A2534). (45)
At is known because it is expressed in terms of A7514 and A7523, Which are measured at the two terminals, and A7512
and A7534, Which are computed from Eqs. ""—.
The sum of the two Eqs. (1212]) may also be written as

753 — 751 = 5 ((754 — 751) + (753 — 752) + C RAB(XB17XA2) — C RAB(XA37XB4))- (46)

The difference between the two range measurements RAB(X131,XA2) and RAB(XA3, X34) produces a correction to the
the sum of the two Clock times intervals measured at the two terminals. This correction depends on the range—rate
between the two terminals l]. Equation can also be written as

§(t1 + 754) — §(t2 + 753) = 2—0 (RAB(XA37XB4) — RAB(XB17XA2))7 (47)
Which represents the essence of Einstein’s procedure for Clock synchronization.

to evaluate the stability of Clock synchronization .7 I, m. The baseline approach in ACES is to use the MWL
hardware to enable time and frequency transfer Em. Alternatively, the BLT may also be used for this purpose, relying
only on the timing information in Eqs. ""—. Below, we develop the appropriate relativistic models.

0 The quantities (?Al — 7A1), (7354 — 7A4) and (72132 — 7'35), (72133 — 7'33) represent the differences between recorded
time tags and proper times. These Clock errors may be modeled as quadratic functions of the measured proper
time. For example, the time tag error (?Al — 7A1) is given as:

A A A 1 A A A
(7A1 — 7A1) : 05A + 5A(7'A1 — TA0) + 57A (7A1 _ 7'A0)2 + O(AT/iﬂa (50)
Where ?A0 is a speciﬁed epoch and Aim 2 +A1 — 72A0' The constants 0%, 5A and 7A are to be estimated during
the data analysis. The other time tag errors are modeled in a similar manner.

0 The quantities (7A1 — t1), (7A4 — t4) and (7-32 — 752), (7-33 — 753) are the general relativistic differences between
proper time and coordinate time. These relationships are established by integrating the equations and -.

o The error terms 67-3, 67-11 and 67g, 671% are instrumental delays due to ﬁxed propagation paths between the optical
systems, detector electronics and the time tag unit. These delays are usually measured and calibrated before
the ﬂight.

o The terms (t4 — t3) and (t2 — t1) represent the coordinate light transfer time elapsed between the signal emission
at one terminal and its reception at the opposing terminal, related to pseudo ranges as given by (1212]).

In the case of the BLT experiment, the signal received on the 188 is time—stamped at the reception and is simulta—

This model could be used to evaluate clock desynchronization in the ACES experiment. It may also be used to develop
appropriate simulation code that is needed to understand the features of ACES. Note that when two ground—based
clocks are used for common View comparison (see Tablel in a terrestrial reference frame, the Sagnac effect must also
be accounted for, as discussed in m.

The ﬁrst 1/c—term in represents the difference between optical paths (given by (1213]) and (171211)) of the two signals
traveling between receiver and transmitter in a two—way communication link. This term depends on the geocentric
positions of both the ACES and a ground station. This information, in particular, is helpful to investigate the accuracy
needed for trajectory reconstruction of the 188 in order to satisf the ACES’ science requirements. Similar questions
were addressed previously under different sets of assumptions Elia, I, 1.

Using -, we evaluate the geometric uncertainty due to imprecision in the ISS navigation:

Consider the case in which the velocity of the ground—based station is well known and the largest systematic error comes
from the uncertainty in the velocity of the 188. We take the instant with the longest round—trip time A7514 2 t4 — 751

that instant is also small, cos(ﬁAB, 913) m 1 — hlss/TE. Then, assuming that the timing accuracy for the ISS pass is
better than éﬂmp] g 0.3 ps, from (1E1) we have the accuracy at which the ISS velocity needs to be known:

which is equivalent to the requirement that the geocentric position of the ACES package on the 188 be known to

of 0.3 ps. On the other hand, as we see from -, there will be many contributions to the timing error, with the ISS
positional error being just one of them. Thus, based on the anticipated precision of the time transfer experiments,
we require that the ISS positional error contributes less than 10% of the timing error of 0.3 ps, which translates into
a requirement that the eocentric position of ACES be known to Uhxss g \/0—1 . 20.8 In 2 6.3 m. This is consistent
with earlier estimates j and can be achieved with existing navigation capabilities m.
2. Two—way pseudomnge

The time observables -—(]71_T[) may also be used to develop a two—way pseudorange estimate. Similarly to -, we
use the time tag quadruplet {7131772157 7:133, 7014} to derive an expression for the observed two—way pseudorange, which
is half the sum of the one—way pseudoranges:

6pOAb§ I %C(A7:A1]32 + ATB3A4) : %C(A7:A1A4 — A?Bng) E %C((7:K4 — 7:31) — (711%?) — 71132)), (56)

The computed pseudorange is given by

Where now times are modeled times for those reported by the Clocks 0n stations A and B . To facilitate computation,
this expression is written as a sum of the following terms:

Where all the quantities present in this equation are deﬁned after (ll

The two—way range model may be used to improve navigation of the ACES package on the 188. If enough
satellite laser ranging (SLR) stations participate in the laser ranging campaign, ACES may be able to completely
address its precision navigation needs. Although geodetic satellites yield trajectory reconstruction accuracy at the
level of N1 cm, the 188 Will not allow for such a precision. As we discussed earlier, the station is subject to signiﬁcant
nongravitational forces Whose presence degrades the trajectory reconstruction. Nevertheless, because of its potential
navigational value, the use of SLR for ACES needs further investigation, especially Within the BLT experiment El].

B. Frequency observables: the gravitational redshift

The microwave link (MWL) component of ACES utilizes three different microwave frequencies (one uplink, two
downlink) to provide for reliable (not weather—dependent) transfer of timing and frequency information. In particular,
for frequency observables, the combined use of uplink and downlink observables allows for the formulation of a science
observable, from Which the effects of the Doppler frequency shift and atmospheric noise are canceled t0 the ﬁrst order.

To formulate the gravitational redshift observable, we assume the presence of a 0ne—way and a two—way frequency
observable. TWO—Way, in this context, means a coherent retransmission of a signal received from the ground. We
assume that the signal retransmission is instantaneous. Such an observable can always be synthesized using the three
radio frequency observables that are produced by the MWL experiment.

We use ?Al to represent the proper time transmission of a signal from worldline A at proper time 71051), Which
is then received at worldline B at proper time 7A'132. An inﬁnitesimal interval d7A'A1 at the transmitter corresponds to
an inﬁnitesimal interval (£72132 at the receiver. The number of cycles transmitted during this interval, dn, is equal to
the number of cycles received at the receiver. On the other hand the number of cycles is the product of the signal
frequency and the time interval, therefore ng(%A1)d%A1 = fgﬁggmfgg, 0r

I‘X A tx A de1
f3 (7132) = fi (mar. (61)

7'B2
Similarly, this signal is immediately retransmitted t0 the ground at the same frequency and then received at 713 in a

two—way retransmission scheme, the received frequency is given by
df- df' df-
2W A rx A B2 tx A A1 B2

A < A3) f3 < B2) mg a < A1) (#132 M < >

"
"16","16
Similarly, a one—way signal transmitted from B at 7A'132 at frequency fEXﬁBg) is received at station A at the frequency
w A x A d? B
f1 (m) = 113, <TB2>dA—2. (63)
7'A3
The one—way frequency shift between the transmission and the reception frequency includes contributions from the
relativistic Doppler effect, from atmospheric noise, and from the gravitational redshift. In contrast, the frequency shift
in the two—way transmission includes twice the contributions from the relativistic D0 opler effect and from atmospheric
noise, but gravitational redshift contributions are canceled out to ﬁrst order -, This allows for the formulation
of a ﬁrst—order “D0pp1er—canceled” observable in the form,
obs _ féw(rA3)—f13(ﬂ32) 1 fiwﬁm) — fAWAl)
fB(TB2) fA(TA1)
For ACES, the removal of the ﬁrst—order Doppler effect will be enabled by the MWL El], which will also allow for the
removal of the troposphere time delay, as well as the removal of instrumental delays and common mode effects.
This observable can also be computed from the ratio of proper times that, in turn, can be estimated from orbits:
df'Bg 1 df'Al
5mm: [__1]__[__1]. 65
""f (mg 2 (mg ( )
To develop Eq. further, we use the differential equation that relates the rate of the proper times, TA and 73,
as measured by a round—based and on—board Clock in Earth’s orbit, correspondingly, t0 the time in GCRS, denoted
here as 75 (see Refi) as
d’TA 1 Vi _4 d7 B 1 V123 —4
W = 1 — 0—2 [7 + UE(yA)] + O(C ) and E = 1 — 0—2 [7 + UE(yB)] + O(C ). (66)
Taking into account that (dTA /dt— 1) % (dTB /dt — 1) N 10—9, and assuming that time tag errors, ?A, and instrumental
drifts, 67):, are small, we can rewrite d7A'A1 in the following form:
d(i‘A — 7' ) ($67): dTA
1A : (1 _A _)(_) 11 o , 67
7A1 + dt + dt dt :51 1+ (6A) ( )
were we use (dTA/dt)t1 to mean the value of the expression at t = t1 and the error term, 6A, is
dTA d(i‘A — 7' ) d67'e _
:___1](—A —A) o 4. 68
EA idt dt +dt + (C) ()
For 6A to be less than the frequency stabilization accuracy anticipated from on ACES, i.e., EA 3 10—17, the time tag
errors (i.e., scale and Clock acceleration errors), 6731 = d(i‘A — TA)/dt, and instrumental drifts, 67""): = d6TX/dt, must
not exceed 671,671): g 10 ns/s. Otherwise the approximation needs to be updated to include -, which we omit
below. Using -, our approximation results in
A d 7A'A — 7' A A A _
(”A 3 % = 6A Mm — TAO) + amiss 2). (69)
As a result, to approximation appropriate for ACES, (m takes the following linearized form:
- d
(ml : (Hm +613) (ﬂ) dtl. (70)

Similarly, we have the other two expressions
- d

A A -r dTB
dTBg : (1 -1— 673 -1— 6713) (—) dtl. (72)

where the instances of coordinate time 752 and 753 are related by -. Although events of the original signal emission
at 751 and its ultimate reception at 753 are not connected by the same light cone, we nevertheless may compute the
total time elapsed between the two events (as was ﬁrst observed in 1.) Indeed, taking 752 = 753 in -, we have:
251 : t3 — C_1(RAB(XA(t1),XB(t2)) + 7213A (x3022), Mag»). (76)
Thus, the total coordinate time elapsed between the two events is fully determined by the locations of the two stations.
In fact, using the ﬁrst equation in and we have the following exact expression for the ratio of coordinate

where we introduced atmospheric delay 6333 for the signal from station A on the up—link and atmospheric delays
6333, 613% for the downlink leg of the two—way signal originating at station A and the downlink signal originating at
B , respectively. This allows us to account for the fact that atmospheric delay is frequency dependent effect increasing
the length of the propagation path in the atmosphere. Note that due to the relativistic frequency shift, atmospheric
delay is different for uplinks and downlinks.
The results given by Eqs. ""— allow us to present -, describing the frequency difference between the signal
transmitted from B and received at A, comparing it to the local oscillator at A, as

The resulting expression is valid for arbitrary worldlines of A and B . Although contains all three values of
time, t1, t2, 753, any two of these values are determined by the third. We Choose the time of ﬁnal reception at A, 753, as
the independent variable. The values of 751 and 752 may be explicitly expressed Via 753 as t1(t3) and 752(753) by applying
the transformations and -. Furthermore, and relate the coordinate time t3 t0 the proper time 7A3
and can be integrated to determine t3 = t3(7'A3) and Vice versa.
To simplify the model (El), we evaluate the terms on the right—hand side of this equation using the ACES conﬁgu—
ration. To do this, we estimate the following ratio:
d7 d7 ‘1 1
1 — (—13) (_A) 2 _2 (%(V]232 — v33) + UE(X132)— UE(XA3)) + 0(0—4) : 3.675 X 10—10. (80)
dt t2 dt t3 C
This term is signiﬁcant and must be kept in the model. The 1/04 terms in produce contributions of the order
of N 5 X 10—19, which is beyond the ACES capability and may be omitted. Next, using expansions presented in the
Appendix B of we evaluate the term
1 d 1 d _ 1 _

where rA3132 : r132 —rA3, rA3132 : ergggl, nA3132 : rAggg/rAggg, and VA3132 = V132 —VA3 Thus, this term also must be
included in the model. However, the atmospheric contribution may be omitted from this term. Indeed, atmospheric
delay is 6??“ N 2 m and, even if it changes at a rate of N 2 m/s, the resulting term 046??“ = 6.67 X 10—9, multiplied
by -, produces a negligible contribution.
Similarly we evaluate the factor in the square brackets in second term of (TED. Thus, using we have:

This quantity is fully determined by the worldlines 0f the two stations at various moments of signal propagation. We
introduced p335“ = §(63tf3 + 6333) — 61233, which denotes temporal change in the asymmetry of the atmospheric delay
between down— and uplinks during the combination of a two—way and a one—way communication link used to cancel
the ﬁrst—order Doppler shifts. We can see that the ﬁrst—order Doppler cancelation scheme given by Eqs. ""—
also greatly reduces contributions associated with various noise sources, especially atmospheric noise. Originally, with
accuracy up to 1/02, Eq. was developed for the Gravity Probe A experiment 1, which was later updated for
ACES to include the 1/02 terms in 1. Our results are similar, but they were developed using a different approach,
which allows for a signiﬁcant generalization.
As a last step, we express all the quantities in using the proper time of ﬁnal reception, 7A3, corresponding to
coordinate time 753. This can be done by using the relation between 752 and 753, which to sufﬁcient order is

where aAB = a3 — aA and all the quantities are expressed in terms of 753. Ultimately, ACES will be able to test the
gravitational redshift to an uncertainty level of < 2.0 X 10—6 in 10 days of integration time. Therefore, the contribution
of each term in must be known to an appropriate accuracy. We address these questions and the related precision
of the ISS orbit in the following subsection.

Note that one can also use timing observables to investigate the relative frequency stability between the Clocks 0n
the ground and those is space. In Sec. III A we introduced desynchronization between the two Clocks with observable,
6TAB(t), given by and the model -. The local time stability of these measurements may allow for a precise
estimation of a time drift over a short duration (around 1 min), according to this approximation of the derivative:

These quantities correspond to a relative frequency offset, 6 f AB, seen by the station A during the time interval T
with respect to the nominal frequency f0 0f the oscillator at A. Such a quantity may allow the use of laser ranging
data from the BLT experiment for an independent veriﬁcation of 5f AB / f 0 established by the MWL.
C. Precision of ISS navigation

Now we can address the question of navigational precision for the 188, which is needed to satisfy the ACES
requirements based on the anticipated precision of the red—shift experiment. To do that, we consider the proper—to—
coordinate time transformation for the clock on the 188 that is given by -. We begin with presenting this equation
in terms of the Keplerian elements of the orbit of the 188 including the semi—major axis, a, eccentric anomaly,
5 : M —1— e sing (with M being the mean anomaly), eccentricity, e, orbital radius, 7° 2 a(1 — 6 cos 5).

Collecting all the terms relevant to establishing the orbit of the ACES Clocks, we have:

a0 a0 m
where 730 is the inclination, w is the altitude of perigee and u is the true anomaly. Also, the subscript 0 refers to an
unperturbed quantity and the error term is set by the lunar tides.

The ﬁrst term in Eq. evaluates to 9.83 X 10—10 and is responsible for the largest frequency shift for a clock on
Keplerian orbit around the Earth. The second term, which is of the order of 1.73 X 10—13, represents perturbation
due the Earth’s oblateness. The third term is the eccentricity correction, which was evaluated to be 7.86 X 10—13.
Note that oblateness contributes a N 1 X 10—16 correction to this term. The fourth term is a quadratic eccentricity
correction with a magnitude of 4.72 X 10—16. The ﬁfth term has an amplitude 3.86 X 10—13. The sixth term amounts
to N 3.39 X 10—16 and is due to the shift of the ACES position with respect to the center of origin of the SCRS 0n
the 188. The last term has the magnitude of up to N 1.15 X 10—14 is due to atmospheric drag. The contributions of
all these terms are signiﬁcant at the expected level of accuracy of ACES.

Considering the ﬁrst term in Eq. (0r, similarly, the ﬁrst two terms in for the red—shift experiment), we see
that during a 90—minute ISS orbit, the altitude of the space station must be known to

BGME ‘1 dTA dTA

It is anticipated that during an integration time of 103 s, the frequency stability of the ACES Clock should be better
than 6f/f = 6(d7‘A/dt) : 1 X 10—15. This sets the requirement on the ISS positional error of 6.89 m or less. In
the absence of reliable computer simulations or other estimates, we rely on the “rule of thumb” that no individual

"
"20","20
contribution to the total error shall exceed 10% of the total error. This implies that the position of the 188 on its orbit
around the Earth should be known with accuracy better than 6610 g \/0—1 ' 6.89 m 2 2 m (i.e., similar to 1.) As the
orbital plane of the ISS precesses with each revolution, it is necessary to track the orbital changes on a permanent
basis. Therefore, a combination of several methods of orbit determination is needed, including the use of traditional
radio—tracking in conjunction with GPS and SLR (for instance, as part of the BLT experiment).

The presence of the J2 term in may be accounted for within a perturbation theory. Perturbations of the
ISS orbits due to Earth’s quadrupole are a signiﬁcant fraction of the change in semi—major axis associated with the
corresponding orbit change. One needs to estimate the effect of the Earth’s quadrupole moment on the orbital elements
of a Keplerian orbit of the space station and also on the change in frequency induced by an orbit change. Accounting
for the perturbation in Keplerian orbital elements of the ISS orbit including the semi—major axis, a, eccentric anomaly,
5 : M —1— e sing (with M being the mean anomaly), eccentricity, e, orbital radius, 7° 2 a(l — 6 cos 5), we can compute
perturbations to each of the terms vi, in GME/TA and the quadrupole term in (or, equivalently, in Eq. -).
The corresponding calculations are lengthy but straightforward, and are well—known. Here we present only the ﬁnal
relevant result to the frequency shift of the ACES clock induced by the orbital parameters of the ISS. Considering
only the last periodic term in -, the additional time elapsed for an orbiting clock may be given as

where the true anomaly was replaced by u 2 77.75, with n = (GME/agﬁ being the approximate mean motion of the ISS.
Integrating and dropping the constant of integration (assuming as usual that such constant time offsets are lumped
with other contributions) gives the periodic relativistic effect on the elapsed time of a clock due to Earth’s quadrupole
moment:
A7112 = —MJ2E [E] 2 sin2 730 sin 2(w0 + nt). (95)
202 cm
The phase of this effect is zero when the ISS passes through Earth’s equatorial plane going northwards. The magnitude
of this effect A7112 AGES 2 1.70 X 10—10 s, which is signiﬁcant for the ACES experiment. Contributions of higher zonal
harmonics in the Earth’s gravitational potential are beyond the ACES sensitivity and may be neglected.

Next, we consider the frequency shift due to the ACES position on the 188. By parameterizing the ACES position
vector with respect to the SCRS as y A0 = onnAo, we may present the relevant term in in the form

(dd? — 1)10C : —Cl—2(aISSO 'yAO) : f2—jz2flyA0(nlsso 'nAO) S 2.91 X 10—15COSQAO, (96)
where cos 6A0 = (ﬂIssO ' nAO) with nIss being the unit vector in the direction to the 188 from GCRS.

As the reference systems introduced on the ISS accelerate in the Earth’s gravity ﬁeld, their clocks follow different
worldlines separated by a small, but ﬁnite distance. Such a separation leads to an acceleration—inoluceol redshift
between the clocks at the origins of the SCRS and the ACRS. Instrumentally, this effect represents a constant bias in
the ACES clocks compared to the time in the SCRS. Because of the small eccentricity of the ISS orbit of e = 0.006
(see Table I, any variability in will be at least e—times smaller and, thus, insigniﬁcant. The ACES package
will be located on the exterior surface of the Columbus module being at N 30 m from the ISS center of gravity. In
addition, the package will be at N 3.5 m in the nadir direction from that point. This position results in cos HAD 2 0.12,
thereby reducing the effect to 3.39 X 10—16, which is small, but still signiﬁcant for ACES.

The near—Earth environment also contributes to the clock rate, especially the atmospheric drag which depends on
the air density, patm, at the ISS altitude. Thus, the density of the upper Earthy’s atmosphere must be monitored.
From Eq. suggests that one needs to know this quantity

6 M c A ‘1 d7 d7

7:: = l—Gc2 EWdWatml 50—23) = 5-20 X 10145(d—f)v <97)
which implies that the atmospheric conditions along the orbital track of the 188 must be known to N 52%, which should
not be a problem if this effect would constitute the total navigational error. However, assuming that atmospheric
drag contributes only 10% of the total error for ACES, the knowledge of the density of the upper atmosphere along
the ISS orbit must be at the level of 6patm/patm : \/0.—1 ' 52% N 16%, which may be challenging as this effect is
dissipative and changes each orbital pass. Furthermore, due to unavoidable orbital boosts needed to raise the altitude
of the 188, the air density will also change.

Atmospheric drag results in the lowering of the semi—major axis of the 188, leading to a change of the gravitational
potential and velocity of the station. This change may indirectly affect relativistic observables. Assuming a circular

"
"21","21

orbit for the 188, we approximate the changes in the semi—major axis, a, and orbital velocity, V, using the equations

[Aaad]rev : _27T%patma(2)7 [Avadhev : Wﬁpatmaﬂvm (98)

m m

where do is the initial length of the semi—major axis and 110 is the initial velocity. For the 188, we determine that

during each revolution, atmospheric drag causes the station’s altitude and velocity to change by up to —18.4 In and

0.01 m/s, respectively, during the period with mean solar activity; and by up to —239 In and 0.13 m/ s during extreme

solar activity. These numbers are of course worst—case estimates, calculated by assuming that the entire area of the

solar panels contributes to the effect (i.e., that the solar panels are perpendicular to the velocity vector with respect

to the atmosphere). Nevertheless, to compensate for this drop in orbital velocity, the ISS periodically has to re—boost
and regain velocity and orbital altitude.

Orbital changes due to atmospheric drag will have a direct impact on the relativistic time and frequency
observables of ACES. Taking, for instance, the velocity change per revolution Avrev (given by the second equation in
-), from we see that, depending on the solar activity, these changes produce the contribution to proper—to—
coordinate time of the order of (dTA/dt)ad and, as a result, its effect on frequency stability may be given as:

(1 — ddeLd : g(vlsso .vad)rev g and—gpatmaovg = %w%pm : (0.89 — 11.54) X 10—15. (99)

Although there is no explicit dependence of this effect on the ISS orbit, there is implicit dependence as the air density
at the ISS orbit is a function of its altitude and orbital inclination. Atmospheric drag results in the loss of the ISS orbital
altitude, causing changes of the gravitational potential at the clocks location. Such an altitude decrease results in the
change of the clock rate per orbital revolution at the level of (1—d7'B/dt) ad 2 O_2VUE [Aaadhev 2 (1.78—23.11)>< 10—15.

The projected stability of the ACES’ frequency transfer of 6 f / f : 1 X 10—16 puts even tougher requirements on
the knowledge of the ISS position and the air density at the its altitude. In fact, in accord with and (103, one
would have to require that the geocentric position of the ISS and the air density for each orbit must be known to
0.2 In and 2%, correspondingly, which is consistent with l, m, but is stronger than previously thought E”. If the
orbital parameters of the 188 would stay constant over many days, these new requirements would not matter. In that
case, the corresponding effects would contributions only constant once—per—orbit terms, which could be estimated and
removed in the data analysis. However, we know that this is not true and the trajectory of the space station
changes signiﬁcantly each orbit. Therefore, ﬁnding ways to mitigate the related uncertainty deserves further study.

IV. CONCLUSIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS

We considered the formulation of a relativistic model for the observables of the ACES mission. We derived an
analytic expression that characterizes the process of forming the frequency comparison observables. This material can
be used to improve the accuracy of modeling of the ACES fundamental observables.

We presented a hierarchy of relativistic coordinate reference frames that are needed to ACES. We introduced the
geocentric (GCRS), topocentric (TCRS), spacecraft (SCRS), and ACES—centric coordinate reference systems, together
with the structure of the corresponding metric tensors in each of these systems and the form of the proper relativistic
gravitational potentials—all presented at the accuracy required for ACES. We presented the rules for transforming
time and position measurements between the reference frames involved. We demonstrated, by meticulously computing
all possible forces, that contrary to naive expectations the ACES reference frame is pseudo—inertial at the level
of accuracy required by the ACES experiment. We also emphasized the need to recognize the importance of the
barycentric (BCRS) reference frame for proper modeling of the solar gravity potential at the ACES’ location.

We considered the model for the relativistic observables of the ACES experiment. The currently implemented
proper—to—coordinate time transformation is a concern as it accounts only for the monopole contribution of the Earth’s
gravity ﬁeld omitting higher multipoles. As such, the current model is accurate only up to 3.86 X 10—13 for ACES.
Including the Earth’s oblateness J2 improved the relation between proper and coordinate times. In the improved
model, J2 is responsible for a periodic effect of the order of 170 ps (or N 10.2 cm peak—to—peak) for ACES.

After accounting for the Earth’s oblateness J2, the error term in the updated model for ACES is at the level of
3 X 10—16, the limit set by the higher other gravity harmonics in the gravitational potential of the extended Earth.
The conventional form of the light time solution is accurate up to the order of N 2 X 10—15 s (due to the Earth’s
J2 coefﬁcient) and, thus, it is adequate for ACES. The usual form for relativistic terms in the spacecraft equations
of motion are also adequate for the task. They are accurate up to the contribution comin% from relativistic term
due to Earth’s oblateness l], which was evaluated to be of the order of N 2.85 X 10—11 m/ s for a LEO spacecraft,
which may be important for some high—precision orbit determination in the near future. However, the presence of

"
"22","22
the nongravitational forces, especially atmospheric drag, limits the equation to only N 1.0 X 10—7 m/s2 (from -)
resulting in -, which is adequate for the anticipated positional accuracy needed for ACES.

In a practical sense, the small relativistic terms that we calculated are easily absorbed into constant and periodic
aol—hoc biases that are introduced during data analysis, with no impact whatsoever on mission objectives or the
quality of the mission’s results. Yet the existence of these terms, and the fact that they are observable at the level of
sensitivity of the ACES experiment demonstrate that ACES is already a practical instrument for relativistic geodesy.
For future spacecraft that operate at even greater accuracy, accounting for these relativistic terms will be essential.

As we discussed, the ISS is a subject to many nongravitational forces and related torques; therefore, the ISS may
not be treated as a free—falling platform. Although any direct effect of nongravitational accelerations on Clock rates
is negligible, these forces still affect the ACES experimental precision. The effect is indirect and comes from the
uncertainties introduced in the estimates of the ISS trajectory. In fact, the ACES experiment must rely on the
navigational precision of the ISS to reach its science objectives.

In particular, it is necessary to consider the effect due to attitude variations. While this effect is small, it is larger
than that of the atmospheric drag and, thus, it is of concern. If such a contribution to the frequency comparison is
of a systematic origin, it is possible to develop a model to calibrate ACES observables and remove such an unwanted
effect. However, attitude variations at this level may occur during various mission events (e.g., docking/un—docking
of the crew and cargo supply vehicles, conﬁguration changes in the ISS, crew exercise, thruster ﬁrings, etc.) It may
be necessary to monitor the dynamical environment on the ISS to keep track of those Changes in order to be able to
account for their likely effects on the ACES Clock.

Comparing the newly developed models for time transfer and gravitational redshift given by and -, we see
that frequency transfer puts more demanding requirements on the orbit of the space Clock. Similar questions were
addressed previously under different set of assumptions El, El, I, m. In this work, we found that to satisfy the
anticipated stability of the frequency transfer of 6 f / f : 1 X 10—16 the geocentric position of the ACES Clock and the
air density at the ISS altitude must be known to 0.2 m and 2%. We investigate the ways to satisfy these requirements
including the use of the advanced facility for high—precision satellite laser ranging being currently developed at J PL and
implementation of the new data analysis strategy that relies on processing the Clock and navigational data together.

Concluding, we mention that we begun to address the issues above by developing a comprehensive modeling,
simulation, and data analysis software system for ACES. To that extent, we already initiated the development of a
simulation system relying in part on existing software suite developed for other missions (i.e., OPALSlO). We pay
special attention to the issues related to I88 navigation and combination of various data—types needed to achieve
not only high—precision navigation, but also highly accurate science models. The high—accuracy models for the time
transfer and the gravitational redshift experiment developed here will be used to process the ACES measurements
for science data analysis. The corresponding software suite relying on the models obtained here is currently being
developed. Preliminary results are encouraging and will be published in subsequent publications.
