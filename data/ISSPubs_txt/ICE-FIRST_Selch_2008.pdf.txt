Abstract
On Earth, it is common to employ laboratory animals such as the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans to help understand human health
concerns. Similar studies in Earth orbit should help understand and address the concerns associated with spaceﬂight. The “International
Caenorhabditis elegans Experiment FIRST” (ICE FIRST), was carried out onboard the Dutch Taxiﬂight in April of 2004 by an inter—
national collaboration of laboratories in France, Canada, J apan and the United States. With the exception of a slight movement defect
upon return to Earth, the result of altered muscle development, no signiﬁcant abnormalities were detected in spaceﬂown C. elegans.
Work from J apan revealed apoptosis proceeds normally and work from Canada revealed no signiﬁcant increase in the rate of mutation.
These results suggest that C. elegans can be used to study non—lethal responses to spaceﬂight and can possibly be developed as a biolog—
ical sensor. To further our understanding of C. elegans response to spaceﬂight, we examined the gene transcription response to the 10
days in space using a near full genome microarray analysis. The transcriptional response is consistent with the observed normal devel—
opmental timing, apoptosis, DNA repair, and altered muscle development. The genes identiﬁed as altered in response to spaceﬂight are
enriched for genes known to be regulated, in C. elegans, in response to altered environmental conditions (Insulin and TGF—B regulated).
These results demonstrate C. elegans can be used to study the effects of altered gravity and suggest that C. elegans responds to spaceﬂight
by altering the expression of at least some of the same metabolic genes that are altered in response to differing terrestrial environments.
