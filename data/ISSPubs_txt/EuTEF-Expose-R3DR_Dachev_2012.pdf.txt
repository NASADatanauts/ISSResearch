Abstract
Space radiation has been monitored successfully using the Radiation Risks Radiometer—Dosimeter (R3D) installed at the ESA
EXPOSE-R (R3DR) facility outside of the Russian Zvezda module of the International Space Station (ISS) between March 2009
and January 2011. R3DR is a Liulin type spectrometer—dosimeter with a single Si PIN detector 2 cm2 of area and 0.3 mm thick. The
R3DR instrument accumulated about 2 million measurements of the absorbed dose rate and ﬂux of 10 s resolution. The total external
and internal shielding before the detector of R3DR device is 0.41 g cm”. The calculated stopping energy of normally incident particles to
the detector is 0.78 MeV for electrons and 15.8 MeV for protons. After the Coronal Mass Ejection (CME) at 09:54 UTC on 3 April 2010,
a shock was observed at the ACE spacecraft at 0756 UTC on 5 April, which led to a sudden impulse on Earth at 08:26 UTC. Never—
theless, while the magnetic substorms on 5 and 6 of April were moderate; the second largest in history of GOES ﬂuence of electrons with
energy >2 MeV was measured. The R3DR data show a relatively small amount of relativistic electrons on 5 April. The maximum dose
rate of 2323 pGy day‘1 was reached on 7 April; by 9 April, a dose of 6600 pGy was accumulated. By the end of the period on 7 May 2010
a total dose of 11,587 pGy was absorbed. Our data were compared with AE—8 MIN, CRESS and ESA—SEEl models using SPENVIS and
with similar observations on American, J apanese and Russian satellites.
