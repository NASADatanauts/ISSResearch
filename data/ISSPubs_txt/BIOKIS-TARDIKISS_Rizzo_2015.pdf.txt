The TARDIKISS (Tardigrades in Space) experiment was part of the Biokon in Space (BIOKIS) payload, a set of multidisciplinary
experiments performed during the DAMA (Dark Matter) mission organized by Italian Space Agency and Italian Air Force in
2011. This mission supported the execution of experiments in short duration (16 days) taking the advantage of the microgravity
environment on board of the Space Shuttle Endeavour (its last mission STS-134) docked to the International Space Station.
TARDIKISS was composed of three sample sets: one ﬂight sample and two ground control samples. These samples provided the
biological material used to test as space stressors, including microgravity, affected animal survivability, life cycle, DNA integrity, and
pathways of molecules working as antioxidants. In this paper we compared the molecular pathways of some antioxidant molecules,
thiobarbituric acid reactive substances, and fatty acid composition between ﬂight and control samples in two tardigrade species,
namely, Paramacrobiotus richtersi and Ramazzottius oberhaeuseri. In both species, the activities of ROS scavenging enzymes, the
total content of glutathione, and the fatty acids composition between ﬂight and control samples showed few signiﬁcant differences.
TARDIKISS experiment, together with a previous space experiment (TARSE), further conﬁrms that both desiccated and hydrated
tardigrades represent useful animal tool for space research.
