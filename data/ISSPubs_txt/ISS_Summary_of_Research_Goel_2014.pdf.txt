Abstract
This article is part of a larger body of work entitled, “The Impact of SeX and Gender on Adaptation to Space.”
It was developed in response to a recommendation from the 2011 National Academy of Sciences Decadal
Survey, “Recapturing a Future for Space Exploration: Life and Physical Sciences for a New Era,” which
emphasized the need to fully understand seX and gender differences. In this article, our workgroup—consisting
of expert scientists and Clinicians from academia and the private sector—investigated and summarized the
current body of published and unpublished human research performed to date related to seX— and gender—based
differences in behavioral adaptations to human spaceﬂight. This reView identiﬁes seX—related differences in: (1)
sleep, Circadian rhythms, and neurobehaVioral measures; (2) personality, group interactions, and work per—
formance and satisfaction; and (3) stress and Clinical disorders. Differences in these areas substantially impact
the risks and optimal medical care required by space—faring women. To ensure the health and safety of male and
female astronauts during long—duration space missions, it is imperative to understand the inﬂuences that seX and
gender have on behavioral health Changes occurring during spaceﬂight.
