affected by spaceﬂight. TNF-a was not affected by space
(B) ﬂight either at the protein or molecular level.
The expression of pro-inﬂammatory cytokines like TNF-a
and IL-6 induce the expression of adhesion molecules. IL-
6 is the principal procoagulant cytokine which acts as a
messenger cytokine (Willerson et a1., 2004). When IL-6 is
released into the systemic circulation, the endothelium
increases the release of adhesion molecules which amplify
inﬂammatory process. So far, reported data on the effects
of spaceﬂight on IL-6 expression in endothelial cells are
scarce. Even in simulated microgravity it has not been
much reported. However, IL-6 protein expression in
murine microvascular endothelial cells was decreased after
72 hours in simulated microgravity (Cotrupi et a1., 2005).
The differences in that result with our ﬁnding maybe due
to the different species of endothelial cells used in that
