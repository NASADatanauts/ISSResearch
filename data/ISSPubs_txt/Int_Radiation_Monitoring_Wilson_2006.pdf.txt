Abstract
The ISS and the prior station Mir provided the proving ground for future human long—duration space activity. A recent Euro—
pean Space Agency study recommended “Measurement campaigns on the ISS form the ideal tool for experimental validation of
radiation environment models, of transport code algorithms and reaction cross sections”. Indeed, prior measurements on Shuttle
have provided Vital information impacting both transport code and environmental model development. Recent studies using the
ISS 7A conﬁguration With TLD area monitors demonstrated that computational dosimetry requires environmental models With
accurate anisotropic and dynamic behavior, detailed information on rack loading, and an accurate 6 degree—of—freedom description
of the ISS trajectory. The ISS model is now conﬁgured for 11A and uses an anisotropic and dynamic geomagnetic transmission and
trapped proton models. The ISS 11A is instrumented With both passive and active dosimetric devices. Time resolved measurements
have the advantage of isolating trapped proton and galactic cosmic ray components as was essential to transport code validation in
Shuttle data analysis. ISS 11A model validation Will begin With passive dosimetry as was used With ISS 7A. Directional dependent
active measurements Will play an important role in the validation of environmental model anisotropies.
