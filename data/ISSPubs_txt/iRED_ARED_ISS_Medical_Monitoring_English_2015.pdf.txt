Spaceﬂight on the ISS

INTRODUCTION: Long-duration spaceﬂight results in a loss of muscle strength that poses both operational and medical risks, particularly
during emergency egress, upon return to Earth, and during future extraterrestrial exploration. Isokinetic testing of the
knee, ankle, and trunk quantiﬁes movement-speciﬁc strength changes following spaceﬂight and offers insight into the
effectiveness of in-ﬂight exercise countermeasures.
METHODS: We retrospectively evaluated changes in isokinetic strength for 37 ISS crewmembers (Expeditions 1—25) following 163 i

38 d (mean : SD) of spaceﬂight. Gender, in—ﬂight resistance exercise hardware, and preﬂight strength were examined as
potential modiﬁers of spaceﬂight-induced strength changes.

RESULTS: Mean isokinetic strength declined 8—17%fo||owing spaceﬂight. One month after return to Earth, strength had
improved, but small deﬁcits of 1 —9% persisted. Spaceﬂight-induced strength losses were not different between men
and women. Mean strength losses were as much as 7% less in crewmembers who ﬂew after the Advanced Resistive
Exercise Device (ARED) replaced the interim Resistive Exercise Device (iRED) as the primary in-ﬂight resistance exercise
hardware, although these differences were not statistically signiﬁcant. Absolute and relative preﬂight strength were
moderately correlated (r = —O.47 and —0.54, respectively) with postﬂight strength changes.

DISCUSSION: In-ﬂight resistance exercise did not prevent decreased isokinetic strength after Iong-duration spaceﬂight. However,
continued utilization ofARED, a more robust resistance exercise device providing higher loads than iRED, may result in
greater beneﬁts as exercise prescriptions are optimized. With reconditioning upon return to Earth, strength is largely
recovered within 30 d.
