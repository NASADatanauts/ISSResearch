the operation of the device.

The internal heat transfer processes were found to be very complicated, multi—dimensional, and greatly
dependent on internal and external radiative heat transfer. Internal radiative exchange was found to be
more signiﬁcant than originally anticipated as was the effect Marangoni forces on internal convective
heat transfer. An analysis of the temperature proﬁles in conjunction with vapor—liquid interface mapping
showed that the system could be separated into a number of discrete operation zones depending on the
dominant mode of heat transfer.
