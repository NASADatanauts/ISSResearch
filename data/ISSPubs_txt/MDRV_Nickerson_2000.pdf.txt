The effects of spaceﬂight 0n the infectious disease process have only been studied at the level of the host
immune response and indicate a blunting 0f the immune mechanism in humans and animals. Accordingly, it
is necessary to assess potential changes in microbial Virulence associated with spaceﬂight which may impact
the probability of in-ﬂight infectious disease. In this study, we investigated the effect of altered gravitational
vectors 0n Salmonella Virulence in mice. Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium grown under modeled
microgravity (MMG) were more virulent and were recovered in higher numbers from the murine spleen and
liver following oral infection compared to organisms grown under normal gravity. Furthermore, MMG-grown g
salmonellae were more resistant to acid stress and macrophage killing and exhibited signiﬁcant differences in g
protein synthesis than did normal-gravity-grown cells. Our results indicate that the environment created by g
simulated microgravity represents a novel environmental regulatory factor of Salmonella Virulence. g
