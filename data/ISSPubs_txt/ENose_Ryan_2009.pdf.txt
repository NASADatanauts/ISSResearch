Figure 4: ENose sensor data taken on ISS (A) Eight sensors plotted with change in resistance against
the initial point in the trace. The trace on the top is relative humidity as measured by a humidity sensor in
the sensing chamber of ENose (right axis). (B) Relative humidity in the sensing chamber varied by about
3% RH with a period of 144 minutes. The analysis program detected a change of about 1000 ppm for
each variation. The two axes, Relative Humidity and ppm Water Reported, are scaled to be the same
amount of water; i.e. 4.5% RH is 1700 ppm water. Water detection is used as an example because it is
the species seen most frequently and repeatedly on ISS.
