Abstract—The effect of microgravity 0n the bone tissue of cosmonauts has been studied after a six—month
space ﬂight. The volumetric bone mineral density (VBMD) and the bone structural characteristics of distal
segments in the radius and tibia have been studied by means ofperipheral quantitative computed tomography
(pQCT). The changes in VBMD were found to correlate with the position of the bone relative to the vector
of gravity. In the radius, reversible hypermineralization, together with thickening of the compact bone were
recorded. In the tibia, reversible osteopenia was characterized by signiﬁcant losses in both compact and tra-
becular bones. Irrespective of the position relative to the vector of gravity, there was a trend towards microar-
chitectural deterioration, such as a decrease in the trabecula number and increase in the bone tissue hetero-
geneity. Postﬂight dynamics of structural parameters showed an integrative character with nonlinear time
dependence.
