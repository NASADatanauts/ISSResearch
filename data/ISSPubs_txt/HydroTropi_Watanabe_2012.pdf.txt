Cucumber (Cucumis sativus) seedlings grown in a horizontal position develop a specialized protuberance (0r peg) 0n the lower
side of the transition zone between the hypocotyl and the root. This occurs by suppressing peg formation on the upper side Via
a decrease in auxin resulting from a gravitational response. However, the gravity-stimulated mechanism of inducing
asymmetric auxin distribution in the transition zone is poorly understood. The gravity-sensing tissue responsible for
regulating auxin distribution in the transition zone is thought to be the endodermal cell. To characterize the gravity-stimulated
mechanism, the auxin efﬂux facilitator PIN-FORMED1 (CsPIN1) in the endodermis was identified and the localization of
CsPIN1 proteins during the gravimorphogenesis 0f cucumber seedlings was examined. Immunohistochemical analysis
revealed that the accumulation pattern of CsPIN1 protein in the endodermal cells of the transition zone of cucumber seedlings
grown horizontally differed from that of plants grown vertically. Gravistimulation for 30 min prompted Changes in the
accumulation pattern of CsPIN1 protein in the endodermis as well as the asymmetric distribution of auxin in the transition
zone. Furthermore, 2,3,5-trii0d0benzoic acid inhibited the differential distribution of auxin as well as Changes in the
accumulation pattern of CsPIN1 in the endodermis 0f the transition zone during gravistimulation. These results suggest that
the altered pattern of CsPIN1 accumulation in the endodermis in response to gravistimulation inﬂuences lateral auxin
transport through the endodermis, resulting in asymmetric auxin distribution in the transition zone.
