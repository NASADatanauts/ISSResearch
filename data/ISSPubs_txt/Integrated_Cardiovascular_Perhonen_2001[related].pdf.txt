After Bed Rest
“Cardiovascular Deconditioning” 0r Hypovolemia?
Merja A. Perhonen, MD, PhD; Julie H. Zuckerman, RN, RDMS; Benjamin D. Levine, MD

Background—Orthostatic intolerance after bed rest is characterized by hypovolemia and an excessive reduction in stroke
volume (SV) in the upright position. We studied whether the reduction in SV is due to a speciﬁc adaptation of the heart
to head-down tilt bed rest (HDTBR) or acute hypovolemia alone.

Methods and Results—We constructed left ventricular (LV) pressure-volume curves from pulmonary capillary wedge
pressure and LV end-diastolic volume and Starling curves from pulmonary capillary wedge pressure and SV during
lower body negative pressure and saline loading in 7 men (25 i2 years) before and after 2 weeks 0f —60 HDTBR and
after the acute administration of intravenous furosemide. Both HDTBR and hypovolemia led to a similar reduction in
plasma volume. However, baseline LV end-diastolic volume decreased by 20i4% after HDTBR and by 7i2% after
hypovolemia (interaction P<0.001). Moreover, SV was reduced more and the Starling curve was steeper during
orthostatic stress after HDTBR than after hypovolemia. The pressure-volume curve showed a leftward shift and the
equilibrium volume of the left ventricle was decreased after HDTBR; however, after hypovolemia alone, the curve was
identical, with no change in equilibrium volume. Lower body negative pressure tolerance was reduced after both
conditions; it decreased by 27i7% (P<0.05) after HDTBR and by 18i8% (P<0.05) after hypovolemia.

Conclusions—Chronic HDTBR leads to ventricular remodeling, which is not seen with equivalent degrees of acute
hypovolemia. This remodeling leads to a greater decrease in SV during 0rth0static stress after bed rest than hypovolemia
alone, potentially contributing to orthostatic intolerance. (Circulation. 2001;103:1851-1857.)
