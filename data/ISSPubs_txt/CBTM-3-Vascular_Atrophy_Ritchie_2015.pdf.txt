c1ated w1th these enV1ronmental factors, partlcularly rad1atlon, as they have been shown to
have deleterious effects such as increasing the risk of heart disease, cataracts, and accelerated
bone loss [1—3]. The limited food system on board spacecraft can further exacerbate these enVi-
ronmental Challenges by providing relatively high iron intakes, which have historically eX-
Ceeded recommended intakes by 3—4 fold [4].

Linear energy transfer (LET), or the amount of energy that is transferred to a substance as
the radiation passes through, impacts the extent of radiation damage to biological systems [5].
Low LET radiation, such as gamma and X-rays, is more likely to have indirect effects on cells
through the generation of free radicals (e.g., Ho, oOH, H202, and e‘aq), while high LET radia-
tion can physically damage DNA and proteins [5, 6]. Both high and low LET radiation expo-
sure can compromise plasma and organelle membrane integrity and cause DNA damage and
DNA methylation [5, 7]. Once a cell becomes irradiated, possible outcomes include genomic
mutations, cell cycle arrest, and transformation to a potentially carcinogenic cell [7, 8].

Reactive oxygen species are generated within cells immediately after exposure to radiation
and could be exacerbated by other environmental factors, including nutrient status. For exam-
ple, oxidative stress can be propagated in the intestine by consumption of a diet containing
pro-oxidants such as iron, which increases the risk of forming cytotoxic compounds and free
radicals [9]. Physiological outcomes induced by high iron include intestinal barrier damage,
hyperproliferation, downregulated repair mechanisms, as well as altered microbiota and lumi-
nal concentration of short chain fatty acids (SCFA) [10, 11].

Very little research has been done to understand the effect of low dose ionizing radiation
(<1 Gy) and microgravity on the colon luminal environment and intestinal epithelium func-
tion. Large radiation doses (>8 Gy) can cause detrimental effects such as direct mucosal toxici-
ty, delayed gastric emptying and secretion, and Villous shortening [7, 12]. Some data suggests
that radiation exposure can affect the intestinal microbiota, and the presence and composition
of these commensal bacterial groups has an effect on radiation induced-lethality [13—15]. Fur-
thermore, we have reported that consumption of a diet with elevated dietary iron, by itself and
in combination with low LET radiation, can alter the concentration of fecal SCFA [16], suggest-
ing alterations to the composition of the intestinal microbiota or a functional change in micro-
bial metabolism. An understanding of how the aforementioned environmental insults affect
the microbiota is of utmost importance, as alterations to commensal bacterial groups have
been implicated in the onset and recurrence of chronic intestinal inﬂammation and gastroin-
testinal diseases [17, 18].

Mitigating the effects of oxidative stress caused by a combination of radiation exposure and
elevated iron status is an important area of research, as no countermeasures have been thor-
oughly studied. Results from this research would benefit not only astronauts, but others eX-
posed to radiation during medical diagnostic tests, and occupational radiation exposures. To
our knowledge, no study has Characterized the effects of fractionated, low doses (0.5—3 Gy) of
low LET ionizing radiation with a high dietary iron load, or one dose high LET ionizing radia-
tion with simulated lunar gravity conditions on colon microbiota and mucosal homeostasis.
We hypothesized that Characteristics of the space environment (i.e., diet, radiation, and altered
gravity) would alter the intestinal microbiota and epithelium. Therefore the aims of the inde-
pendent studies summarized in this work were to characterize the effects of: 1) low LET radia-
tion exposure and high Fe diet, 2) partial weight bearing (1/ 6 G) and high LET radiation
exposure, and 3) short term spaceﬂight, on the intestinal microbiota, mucosal expression of

gene targets associated with microbial signaling and epithelial repair, and measurements of CO-
lonic injury and inﬂammation in rodents.
Materials and Methods
Animals and diets
The experiments outlined below describe three independent studies. Experimental design was
optimized for each study individually in order to execute funded experiments, which were not
associated with this body of work. Thus, animal model, control diet, and housing continuity
across experiments was not possible. Furthermore, funding for methodologies described herein
was limited and dictated scope of analysis.

Experiment l—fractionated low LET gamma radiation and high dietary iron in rats.
The aim of Experiment 1 was to characterize the impacts of fractionated doses of low LET radi-
ation exposure and high dietary iron on fecal bacterial populations and colon homeostasis.
Thirty two, 12-week-01d, male Sprague-Dawley rats (Charles River Laboratories, Wilmington,
MA, USA) were acclimated to an adequate iron diet (45 mg iron (ferric Citrate)/kg diet) for 3
weeks (AIN-93G; Research Diets, New Brunswick, NJ, USA) and then assigned to one of four
groups: adequate Fe diet/no radiation (CON), adequate Fe diet/radiation (RAD), high Fe diet
(650 mg iron (ferric citrate)/kg diet)/n0 radiation (IRON), and high Fe diet/radiation (IRON
+RAD). Animals received the assigned diet for 4 weeks. On day 14 0f the experiment, animals
began exposures to a 0.375 Gy fractionated radiation dose of 137Cs every other day for 16 days
(3 Gy total dose) at the NASA Johnson Space Center. Animals in both the sham and radiation
groups were placed in a restraint tube (Battelle, Geneva, Switzerland) for about 10 min per
treatment session. On day 29 (24 h after last radiation exposure), animals were euthanized
using isoﬂurane vapor. The colon was resected, feces removed for microbial sequencing analy-
sis, and colonic mucosa scraped in order to determine gene expression. Experiments outlined
in this work are an extension of a previous study, which analyzed the impact of diet and radia-
tion on the colon epithelium and SCFA concentrations in the feces and have been reported pre-
viously [16].

Experiment 2—high LET 28$ilicon particle exposure and partial weight bearing (1/6 G)
in mice. The aims of Experiment 2 were to determine the effect of high LET radiation and
partial/lunar gravity (1/ 6 G) on: 1) fecal bacterial populations, and 2) expression of genes in-
volved in microbial signaling and tissue repair.

Because of sample and funding limitations in this experiment, an aliquot of extracted bacte-
rial DNA was taken from each animal and combined into a composite sample for each experi-
mental group. The isolated composite DNA samples were used for pyrosequencing and further
phylogenetic analysis in order to perform an initial and exploratory characterization of the im-
pact of high LET radiation and unloading 0n microbiota. A description of the methodologies
for this experiment can be found in 81 Appendix.

Experiment 3—combined high LET and low LET radiation exposures and microgravity
conditions during short term space ﬂight in mice. The aims of Experiment 3 were to: 1)
characterize fecal bacterial populations, 2) determine expression of genes involved in microbial
signaling and tissue repair, and 3) assess colonic epithelial injury and inﬂammation in mice
after short-term spaceﬂight.

Fourteen, 49-day-01d, female C57BL/ 6 mice (Charles River, Raleigh, NC, USA) were accli-
mated to NASA Rodent Foodbar diets and water for 2 wk [19]. All animals were then loaded
into NASA-designed animal enclosure modules (AEM’s) and given ad libitum access to food
and water for the remainder of the study. Half of the animals were ﬂown on the Space Shuttle
Atlantis mission STS-135 for a period of 13 days. Lights in both the ground and ﬂight AEM

were on a 12/ 12 h light/dark cycle. Following landing (3—7 hours), all animals were anesthe-
tized by isoﬂurane gas and euthanized by decapitation. The colon was resected, feces removed,
a 1 cm section of the colon was fixed for histological preparations, and the remainder of the
colon mucosa was harvested by scraping as part of a tissue sharing program.
Sample collection and processing

Scraped mucosa. After fecal material was removed, the colon was washed twice in RNase
free Phosphate-Buffered Saline (PBS) and scraped on a Chilled RNase free surface.

Experiment 1. Mucosa was transferred to an RNase free homogenization tube along with
500 [41 0f Denaturation Solution (Ambion, Austin, TX), homogenized by pipetting 6—7 times,
snap frozen, then transported to Texas A&M University on dry ice and stored at -80°C.

Experiment 3. Mucosa was transferred to an RNase free homogenization tube along with
500 [41 0f RNAlater (Ambion, Austin, TX), snap frozen, then transported to Texas A&M Uni-
versity on dry ice and stored at -80°C.

Feces collection and microbial DNA isolation. Upon resection of the colon at termina-
tion, fresh fecal samples were collected and transferred to sterile cryotubes, snap frozen, then
transported to Texas A&M University on dry ice and stored at -80°C. DNA was isolated from
homogenized fecal samples using a FastDNA SPIN kit according to the manufacturer’s instruc-
tions (MP Biomedicals, Solon, OH) [20]. This method includes a physical disruption step to
ensure genomic DNA isolation from Gram positive bacteria. Puriﬁed DNA was stored at
-80°C. A negative control containing H20 instead of sample was puriﬁed in parallel to each set
of extractions to screen for contamination of extraction reagents.

Bacterial DNA isolated from each sample collected in Experiments 1 and 3 was used for pyr-
osequencing and further phylogenetic analysis (described below). For reasons previously de-
scribed, composite samples generated for each treatment in Experiment 2 were used for
these analyses.

Inflammation and injury histological scores

In Experiment 3, a 1 cm segment was removed from the distal end of the colon and ﬁxed in
70% EtOH solution prior to embedding in parafﬁn. Paraffin embedded sections were stained
with hematoxylin and eosin (H&E), and the degree of inﬂammation and morphological injury
induced by space ﬂight was assessed by a board-certified pathologist in a blinded manner. The
degrees of inﬂammation (score of 0—3) and epithelial injury (score of 0—3) in microscopic cross
sections of the colon were graded as described previously [21].

Measurement of gene expression using real-time PCR

Total RNA was isolated from scraped mucosal samples using Phase Lock Gel tubes (5 Prime,
Gaithersburg, MD) and the TOTALLY RNA Kit 0r RNAqueous kit (Ambion, Austin, TX) fol-
lowed by DNase treatment (DNA-free Kit, Ambion, Austin, TX). RNA quality was assessed
using an Agilent Bioanalyzer. First strand CDNA was synthesized using random hexamers,
oligo dT primer (Promega, Madison, WI), and Superscript III Reverse Transcriptase following
manufacturer’s instructions (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA).

Real-time PCR was performed on select genes involved in the TLR signaling cascade (i.e.,
TLR2, TLR4, TLR9, MyD88, NFKB, TNFoc, IL-6, IL- 1b), short chain fatty acid transport (i.e.,
Slc16a1, Slc5a8), and epithelial barrier restitution (i.e., TGFB, TFF3) using Taqman Array
Plates (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA) and a ABI 7900 HT thermocycler (Applied Bio-
systems, Foster City, CA) (81 Table). T0 screen for potential contamination of PCR reagents,

a negative PCR control of H20 instead of CDNA template was used. Expression levels were
normalized to 188 gene expression.
16S rRNA bacterial tag-encoded FLX amplicon pyrosequencing
16S amplicon sequencing was performed as previously described [22]. Brieﬂy, initial amplifica-
tion of the V1-V2 region of the bacterial 16S rDNA was performed on total DNA isolated from
fecal samples. Master mixes for these reactions used the Qiagen Hotstar Hi-Fidelity Polymerase
Kit (Qiagen, Valencia CA) with a forward primer composed of the Roche Titanium Fusion
Primer A (5’ —CCATCTCATCCCTGCGTGTCTCCGACTCAG —3’ ), a 10 bp Multiplex Identiﬁer
(MID) sequence (Roche, Indianapolis, IN) unique to each of the samples, and the universal
bacteria primer 8F (5 ' —AGAGTTTGATCCTGGCTCAG— 3 ' ) [23]. The reverse primer was com-
posed 0fthe Roche Titanium Primer B (5’ —CCTATCCCCTGTGTGCCTTGGCAGTCTCAG
— 3’ ), the identical 10 bp MID sequence as the forward primer and the reverse bacteria primer
338R (5’ —GCTGCCTCCCGTAGGAGT— 3’ ) [24] which span the V1-V2 hypervariable region
of the bacterial 16S rDNA [24]. The thermal profile for the amplification of each sample had
an initial denaturing step at 94°C for 5 minutes, followed by a cycling of denaturing of 94°C for
45 seconds, annealing at 50°C for 30 seconds and a 90 second extension at 72°C (35 cycles), a
10 minute extension at 72°C and a ﬁnal hold at 4°C. Each sample was individually gel puriﬁed
using the E-Gel Electrophoresis System (Life Technologies, Invitrogen). To ensure equal repre-
sentation of each sample in the sequencing run, each barcoded sample was standardized by cal-
culating equimolar amounts prior to pooling. Pooled samples of the 16S rDNA multiplexed
amplicons were sequenced on a Roche 454 Genome Sequencer FLX Titanium instrument
(Microbiome Core Facility, Chapel Hill NC) using the GS FLX Titanium XLR70 sequencing re-
agents and protocols.
Amplicon sequencing data analysis
Analysis of amplicon sequencing data was carried out using the QIIME pipeline [25]. The com-
bined raw sequencing data plus metadata describing the samples were de-multiplexed and
filtered. Next, data were denoised using Denoiser software as described previously [26]. Se-
quences were grouped into OTUs (Operational Taxonomic Units) at a 97% level to approxi-
mate species-level phylotypes using Uclust [27]. OTU sequences were aligned and OTU tables
containing the counts of each OTU in each sample were used to calculate mean species diversi-
ty of each sample (alpha diversity) and the differentiation among samples (beta diversity).
Alpha and beta diversity measures were used to calculate a Cha0 species richness estimate and
a Shannon Weaver diversity indeX for each sample [28, 29]. To evaluate the similarities be-
tween bacterial communities a combination of Unifrac signiﬁcance and principal coordinate
analysis (PCOA) using Fast Unifrac [30] and network analysis were performed to compare
samples based on sample time and treatment.

The 16S rRNA gene sequences obtained were deposited into NCBI’s Sequence Read Archive

(SRA) database with accession number GSE68738.
Statistical analysis
Data were analyzed using two-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) or one sample t-test
(TTEST) in SAS 9.1 (SAS Institute, Inc.). Differences detected by pairwise comparisons with P-
values <0.05 are indicated in each table by superscripts (a, b, C). Data sets from Experiment 3
that were not normally distributed were analyzed using Kruskal-Wallis test. On completion of
all analyses, the uncorrected P-Values underwent a single multiple-testing correction procedure
using the Benjamini and Hochberg false discovery rate (FDR) method. Q values are reported

Results
Experiment 1—Effects of low LET gamma radiation exposure and high
dietary iron on the intestinal microbiota in rats
We observed a significant radiation effect on the Clostridiales order (q = 0.17, 82 Table), with
CON having a signiﬁcantly higher proportion of Clostridiales compared to RAD and IRON
+RAD (both q = 0.14, Fig 1). IRON+RAD had a signiﬁcantly higher abundance of Unknown
OTUS within the Bacteroidetes phylum compared to CON, RAD, and IRON groups (q<0.2, 82
Table). We observed no significant differences in species diversity (Shannon Weaver index) in
response to dietary iron level, irradiation or their interaction (Table 1). Although not statisti-
cally signiﬁcant, species richness (Chao index) was numerically higher in IRON+RAD rats
compared to IRON rats (Table 1). Additionally, we observed relatively large Changes in the fol-
lowing phylogenetic taxa that did not reach signiﬁcance after adjusting for multiple compari-
sons. The abundance of Firmicutes was lower in the RAD group compared to CON (82 Table).
IRON rats tended to have an increased proportion of Bacteroidetes (17%) and decreased

Experiment 2—Effect of high LET 288i particle exposure and PWB on
mucosal gene expression and the intestinal microbiota in mice
The outcomes from this preliminary experiment, which measured the effect of high LET radia-
tion exposure alone or in combination with unloading using a validated ground-based model
of microgravity, did not provide an opportunity to detect statistical differences in bacterial pop-
ulations among treatment groups, as composite samples were used for analysis. However, there
were relatively large changes in the proportion of some bacterial orders detected with unload-
ing (81 Appendix, 83 Table). We did not observe a signiﬁcant effect of radiation or partial
weight-bearing on relative expression of any gene targets analyzed (81 Table).

dosimetry revealed that the animals were exposed to a maximum measured dose of 5.46 i 0.07
mGy, consisting of 112.6 pG/d galactic cosmic rays and 117.8 pGy/d trapped particles.

Microbial diversity, species richness, and taxonomic structure analysis. We observed a
tendency for reduced species richness and diversity in ﬂight mice relative to the ground control
mice, these differences were not signiﬁcant (Table 1). Unifrac and principal coordinate analysis
(PCOA) of all sequences for each sample, represented as a discrete data point without overlap,
revealed distinct clustering of samples collected from ground and ﬂight mice (Fig 3), yet we ob-
served no signiﬁcant differences in OTUS at the phylum level (S4 Table). Flight mice had a nu-
merically higher proportion Bacteroidetes (8%) and lower proportion of Firmicutes (14%)
compared to ground mice (Fig 4). Ground mice had a numerically higher proportion of Erysi-
pelotrichales compared to ﬂight mice. Flight mice had a numerically higher proportion of Clos-
tridiales (60%) and numerically lower proportion of Lactobacillales (62%) compared to ground
mice (Fig 4).

Mucosal gene expression. We observed no signiﬁcant differences in any gene targets ana-
lyzed. However, relative gene expression tended to be higher in TGFB, TLRZ, IL-6 and Slc16a1
in ﬂight mice compared to ground control mice (81 Table).

Immunohistochemical analysis of distal colon. To understand the effects of spaceﬂight
(i.e., combined weightlessness and mixed radiation exposure) on intestinal injury and inﬂam-

Discussion
Astronauts are exposed to different types of radiation composed of varying magnitudes of LET
(protons, alpha particles (hydrogen), and a small percentage of heavy ions (e.g., Fe and Si) and
electrons), which can penetrate shielding and create secondary particles [7]. Radiation expo-
sure and other factors experienced during space ﬂight such as diets high in iron and micrograv-
ity can elevate oxidative stress in the body, which has been shown to upregulate an immune
response and is a factor in bone demineralization, muscle atrophy, cardiovascular decondition-
ing and cataracts [31—33]. Recent studies have shown that the intestinal microbiota can be
altered by oxidative stress and have been implicated in gastrointestinal diseases like inﬂamma-
tory bowel disease (IBD) and cardiovascular disease [18, 34—36]. Furthermore, our recent
studies demonstrated that fecal concentrations of SCFAs are affected by low LET radiation eX-
posure and high dietary iron, suggesting alterations to the microbiota or microbial metabolism
[16]. The initiation and progression of intestinal inﬂammation is of upmost importance to as-
tronaut health, as it known to increase the risk of colorectal cancers [37, 38]. Additionally, the
effect of radiation on the body has been identiﬁed by NASA as one of the most signiﬁcant risks
associated with human space ﬂight, and their recent reports estimated that the “probability of
causation” for colon cancer is 3rd highest in radiation induced cancers following galactic cosmic
radiation exposure [39, 40].

Understanding how different radiation energies affect the intestinal tract is important, as
previous studies have observed differences in cell survival, DNA repair, epithelial cell prolifera-
tion, and tumor incidence following low and high LET radiation exposure [41, 42]. Our study
utilized three independent experiments to characterize how high and low LET radiation expo-
sures, high iron diet, and weightlessness may affect the fecal microbiota and mucosal gene eX-
pression. Ideally each experiment would have a uniﬁed study design, as murine genotype (not
gender) have been reported to affect the microbiota [43, 44]; however, accessibility to irradiated
samples and minimal funding for additional experiments precluded this option. Furthermore,
it is important to elucidate the combined effects of radiation exposure and microgravity on the
colonic environment, as recent studies report a synergistic effect between these exposures and
miRNA expression, immune activation, and bone loss [45—47]. Very little is known about
how the space environment effects intestinal homeostasis; thus, the aim of this study was to

characterize the effect of high and low LET radiation exposure, microgravity, and elevated die-
tary iron on the intestinal microbiota and gene targets associated With microbial derived signal-
ing, metabolite transport, and epithelial barrier restitution.

Phylogenetic classification of fecal intestinal bacterial populations at the phylum level re-
vealed similarities across the various treatments (i.e., low LET radiation, microgravity, elevated
Fe diet). Following either low LET radiation exposure (RAD) or consumption of a high iron
diet (IRON), we observed an increased proportion of Bacteroidetes and decreased Firmicutes
compared to CON. We observed increased Bacteroidetes and decreased Firmicutes following
high dietary iron exposure; however, we did not observe a synergistic effect of low LET radia-
tion exposure and high dietary iron (Experiment 1). Similarly, animals exposed to 13 days of
space ﬂight had an increased proportion of Bacteroidetes and decreased Firmicutes compared
to ground controls. This suggested that mixed radiation exposure associated With space ﬂight
(112.6 [JG/d galactic cosmic rays and 117.8 [.le/d trapped particles), comprised of both high
and low LET radiations produced similar effects to the predominant phyla as treatment With
only one type of radiation (i.e., X ray or high charge (Z) energy (E) silicon nuclei (HZE)).
These global observations of the predominant bacterial groups are of interest, as dysbiosis to
these phyla have been linked to other sources of elevated oxidative stress in the body such as
obesity and IBD [48, 49]. Interestingly, increased proportions of Firmicutes and decreased Bac-
teroidetes have been reported in those studies, Which contrast our observations following radia-
tion exposure, microgravity, and an elevated iron diet.

Historically, studies have shown that the presence of commensal bacterial populations in-
creased radiation induced lethality in conventionalized (i.e., presence of microbiota) compared
to germ free animals [13], but a direct mechanism was not elucidated. More recent studies re-
port alterations to the microbiota after low LET X ray exposure (5—22 Gy), and observed dis-
tinct differences based on dose, amount of time following exposure, as well as presence of
clinical signs such as radiation-induced diarrhea [14, 50]. One small pilot study used denatur-
ing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE) to identify Changes in the bacterial diversity of pa-
tients suffering from acute post-radiotherapy diarrhea (exposures to 4.3—5.4 Gy) [14]. They
observed that the microbial proﬁles of the individuals studied (i.e., no radiation, radiation With
no diarrhea, and radiation With diarrhea) Clustered in unique sets, suggesting that speciﬁc bac-
terial populations could be associated With risk or protection after radiation exposure [14]. An-
other in vivo study demonstrated hierarchical Clustering of bacterial populations from samples
collected 0, 4, 11, and 21 days post 10 Gy low LET radiation exposure suggested distinct differ-
ences in the bacterial populations over time [50]. Although these studies suggest an effect of ra-
diation on microbiota, these studies used large doses of low LET radiation exposures that are
markedly higher than those used in this study (5—22 Gy compared to 3 Gy, respectively), and
did not study the effects of high LET radiation exposure.

Another contradiction to the results in this study is the report of elevated proportions of
pathogenic bacteria in patients With IBD and following low LET X-ray exposure at various
doses [34, 50, 51]. Both insults indicated an increase in bacterial taxa (i.e., Enterobacteriaceae,
Escherichia coli, Salmonella spp.) Classiﬁed in the Proteobacteria phylum, Which is a common
constituent of the commensal intestinal ﬂora but also contains numerous pathogenic species
such as Helicobacter, Klebsiella and Shigella. We observed 30.07% Proteobacteria in all experi-
mental groups analyzed in this study, Which is in contrast to previous animal studies reporting
an elevation in this phylum following 10 and 18 Gy X-ray exposure [50]. This suggests that
modulation of this bacterial group by radiation exposure might be dose dependent. This obser-
vation is positive, as the Virulence of numerous pathogens, including Escherichia coli and Sal-
monella and Bacillus spp., have been reported to be increased following simulated microgravity
and space ﬂight [52—54]. Furthermore, it is thought that microgravity has an effect on ﬁghting

bacterial infections, as studies have reported that hind limb unloaded (HLU) animals have sup-
pressed immune system function and increased lethality when exposed to pathogenic bacteria
(e.g., Klebsiella pneumonia and Pseudomonas aeruginosa) [55, 56]. Additionally, it was re-
ported that HLU mice had elevated bacterial organ load following administration of Klebsiella
pneumonia compared to weight bearing controls, suggesting susceptibility to bacterial translo-
cation from the bowel [55].

To better understand the implications of the observed altered proportions of Firmicutes and
Bacteroidetes, we performed further phylogenetic classification at the order level. Within the
Firmicutes phylum we observed differences in Lactobacillales and Clostridiales in animals eX-
posed to either 10w LET radiation or microgravity. Animals exposed to 13 days space ﬂight had
an increased proportion of Clostridiales and decreased proportion of Lactobacillales compared
to ground controls. We observe a similar trend in the exploratory characterizations from EX-
periment 2, which was independent of radiation exposure, as both LUN SHAM and LUN RAD
showed these population shifts. These reports are similar to those observed in patients with
IBD, as it has been documented in numerous studies a suppression in lactic acid bacteria
(LAB) species as well as increased Clostridium spp (found in Lactobacillales and Clostridiales
order, respectively) [57, 58]. Results from Experiment 1 contrast these observations, as RAD
and IRON+RAD animals have numerically higher proportions of Lactobacillales and signiﬁ-
cantly lower proportion of Clostridiales compared to sham irradiated animals (i.e., CON 8:
IRON). Lower proportions of Clostridiales in these animals may explain our previous observa-
tion of suppressed fecal butyrate [16], since this order harbors bacterial species known to have
the capability to produce this metabolite [59]. An increase in LAB is generally thought to be
positive, as these bacterial populations have been shown to provide health benefits to the host
(e.g., produce antimicrobial substances, compete with pathogens for epithelial binding sites)
and improves symptoms of Chronic intestinal inﬂammation [60, 61]. However, an increase in
luminal H202 produced by these bacteria could exacerbate the effects of an elevated iron diet
by creating highly reactive hydroxyl radicals through iron-mediated Fenton Chemistry [9]. Al-
though this was not directly measured in this study, increased luminal and epithelial reactive
oxygen species (ROS) could potentiate local oxidative stress.

Enhanced oxidative stress has the potential to cause cellular damage and induce an inﬂam-
matory response in the colon, and we previously demonstrated that myeloperOXidase activity
(a marker of neutrophil inﬁltration) is elevated and TLR gene expression altered in colonic mu-
cosa by an elevated iron diet and low LET irradiation [16]. Microbial-derived signaling through
pattern-recognition receptors affects gene expression, transepithelial electrical resistance, C010-
nocyte proliferation in normal tissues [62], and serves a pivotal role in maintaining homeosta-
sis between commensal microbiota and the host immune system [63]. Previous studies have
shown that high LET radiation exposure and microgravity has a direct effect on gene expres-
sion in vitro and in muscle [45, 64, 65], but to our knowledge no analysis has been published
describing these effects in the intestinal tract. Therefore to understand the implications of
mixed radiation exposure and spaceﬂight on these processes, we analyzed mucosal gene eX-
pression of gene targets associated with the TLR signaling cascade, SCFA transport, and epithe-
lial barrier restitution in Experiment 3.

We do not observe a signiﬁcant effect of spaceﬂight for any targets associated with the TLR
signaling cascade 0r SCFA transport. Zhou et al. reported that HLU acts synergistically with ra-
diation exposure to markedly elevate Circulating IFNoc, IL-6, and TNFoc in mice [66]. Although
we did not analyze cytokine concentrations in plasma or other organs, we do not observe an
increase in the relative expression of IL-6, IL-1b, COX-Z 0r TNFoc in the colonic mucosa of
ﬂight mice. Additionally, immunohistological assessment of distal colon did not reveal an in-
crease in inﬂammatory cells or neutrophil infiltration following spaceﬂight. Differences in

these observations could be due to the amount of time following radiation exposure and tissue
collection, or the effect of low dose gamma irradiation compared to mixed radiation exposure
on pro-inﬂammatory cytokine gene expression. It has been reported that immune system re-
sponses following radiation exposure differ across mouse strains and could be a factor when
comparing our results to previous studies [67]. Furthermore, alterations to the microbiota we
observe directly following spaceﬂight may have the ability to initiate an inﬂammatory state and
alter TLR expression if followed for an extended period after return to Earth.

We observed a signiﬁcantly higher relative expression of TGFB in ﬂight mice compared to
ground controls, which contributes to epithelial migration and wound healing [68]. Previous
studies have demonstrated that HLU can affect the ability to ﬁght bacterial infection, and is
thought to be due to impaired barrier integrity of the gastrointestinal tract [55, 66, 69]; howeV-
er, immunohistological assessment of distal colon injury in ﬂight animals does not indicate
short-term space ﬂight significantly affects epithelial integrity.

Conclusion
To our knowledge, this is the ﬁrst study to characterize the effect of both low and high LET ra-
diation exposure, high dietary iron, and gravitational Changes on the intestinal microbiota and
colonic mucosal gene expression. A low dose, fractionated low LET radiation exposure or one
low dose of high LET was Chosen (for Experiments 1 and 2, respectively) to directly compare to
the radiation exposure that astronauts experience during short-duration space ﬂight missions;
however, observations from these experiments could also provide insight for airline crews, ra-
diation workers, and patients receiving heavy-ion cancer therapy. In Experiment 1 and 3, we
did not observe a marked dysbiosis to the predominant phyla, reduced bacterial diversity, nor
an increased proportion of pathogenic genera previously reported during intestinal inﬂamma-
tion and exposure to large doses of low LET radiation. Although minimal differences were
observed in our selected gene targets, we have illustrated unique Changes to the microbiota
following elevated dietary iron consumption, radiation exposure (i.e., low LET and mixed radi-
ation exposure), and space ﬂight. Furthermore, we observed distinct shifts in bacterial popula-
tions in animals exposed to microgravity. These observations suggest unique alterations to
the microbiota when exposed to a space environment compared to other disruptions to intesti-
nal homeostasis such as gastrointestinal disease. Future studies analyzing alterations to the in-
testinal bacterial population’s genetic code, or metagenome, in patients receiving radiation
therapy and astronauts would further elucidate how radiation exposure could affect intestinal
homeostasis.
