The growth rate vs. supersaturation of a lysozyme crystal was successfully measured in Sim together
with the crystal surface observation and the concentration measurements onboard the International
Space Station. A Michelson—type interferometer and a MaCh—Zehnder interferometer were, respec—
tively, employed for real—time growth rate measurements and concentration ﬁeld measurements. The
hardware development, sample preparation, operation, and analysis methods are described. © 2013
