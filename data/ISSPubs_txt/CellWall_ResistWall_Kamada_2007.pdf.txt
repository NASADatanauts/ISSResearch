Abstract The European Modular Cultivation System (EMCS) installed within the US laboratory module,
Destiny, and/or the European experiment module, Columbus, onboard the International Space Station
(ISS), is an ESA facility available for plant research and biological experiments. The EMCS facility uses
standard experiment containers (ECs) mounted on centrifuges and provides life support such as water and
gas supply systems as well as observation systems. The experiment—speciﬁc hardware such as the plant
cultivation Chamber, root phototropism observation Chamber, and plant root gravitropism observation
Chamber is integrated into the EC. JAXA has five themes concerning space plant research, of which
two—Cell Wall and Resist Wall—will include conducting space experiments using the EMCS facility;
according to the present shuttle ﬂight schedule, they are due to be launched in mid February 2007. The
objectives of the Cell Wall / Resist Wall experiment include in—orbit growth of 10—Cm—long inﬂorescence
stems of Arabidopsis and subsequent, post—ﬂight morphology, biological, gene expression, and cell—wall
properties analyses on the ground. In this article, we describe the EMCS facility, the plant cultivation and
onboard Chemical ﬁxation system. Furthermore, we also discuss the veriﬁcation experiments conducted
by JAXA.
