ZQ ' PLOS | O N E Bacterial Community Exoenzyme Production
Introduction
In oligotrophic environments, particularly aquatic systems, acquisition of nutrients from com-
pleX biomolecules is one of the keys to success [1—3]. This acquisition is achieved through
secretion of hydrolytic enzymes to generate soluble products that can be imported for metabo-
lism within the cell [2]. Key to regulation of this behavior is the fact that enzymes carry a meta-
bolic cost and that the soluble products of such enzymes are considered community property,
being available to producers and non-producers alike [4, 5]. To avoid expending energy en un-
recoverable enzymes and limit free-loading Cheater cells, single species and mixed communities
employ chemical signals to coordinate timing and extent of extracellular enzyme production
[4, 6, 7]. Contribution of chemical signaling and community members to extracellular enzyme
production has been studied extensively in single and dual-species cultures [for mixed species,
see [8—11], among others], but the impact of individual species on the production of extracellu-
lar enzymes from more complex communities has received less attention.

In addition to in Vitro studies, extracellular enzymes have been analyzed by direct sampling of
enzymes produced by natural microbial assemblages in diverse environments. These studies focus
primarily on the association of the extracellular enzymes with the nutrient conditions at the study
site or in experimental microcosms [[12—15], among many others]. In these cases, the natural
assemblage is intact and interspecies microbial communication is occurring. While important cor-
relations between taxonomic groups and enzyme activities can be made, the complexity of the
community renders microbiological dissection of the contribution of individual members difﬁcult.

Exoenzyme production is often feedback controlled by the regulation of secreted hydrolytic
enzymes proportional to acquisition of products [16]. Feedback regulation and chemical sig-
naling mechanisms likely combine to dictate the overall production of hydrolytic enzymes
within microbial communities. These regulatory processes would be predicted to result in eXO-
enzyme production that is resilient to Changes in the community under a given set of environ-
mental and nutrient conditions. Complex biological communities often eXhibit robustness to
perturbation [[17] includes a review of robustness for microbial populations]. Robustness is
the maintenance of function and resilience to Change when exposed to changing conditions or
changing species composition [18]. Functional stability is therefore often correlated with diver-
sity in natural communities [19, 20]. This prediction has been experimentally demonstrated
for increasing diversity [21] and species evenness [22]. The latter work, in particular, examined
ecosystem function of a mixed community of denitriﬁers and demonstrated functional robust-
ness linked to initial species evenness [22].

We were interested in the concept of functional robustness in relation to extracellular lipase
and protease production in a model drinking water microbial community. Secreted lipases and
proteases are ecologically and medically important and have not been as well studied as
secreted glycosidases, glucosidases, and amidases. In this study we have used members of a
drinking-water bacterial community derived from the International Space Station Potable
Water Delivery System [23] to systematically investigate the contribution of each community
member on extracellular enzyme production by these model mixed-species communities. We
determined that community production of most extracellular enzyme activities was robust to
absence of any single species.

Results and Discussion

Characterization of the model mixed bacterial community

Our primary goal in this study was to assess exoenzyme production from our model mixed-

species bacterial community. We Chose cultivable isolates from the ISS potable water system

[23] that were well-described, common, and abundant members of most drinking water bio-
film communities [24, 25]. Members of drinking water and other biofilm communities often
have distinct interactions that lead to stable association and community formation [26]. Thus,
the isolation of the bacteria in this study from the same bioﬁlm sample likely contributed to
our success in establishing a reproducible model community.

Using a static culture system, the mixed-species bacterial communities form a mixture of
robust biofilms and planktonic cells by 72 hours, which is the duration of the experiments
reported below. We Chose 72 h because all exoenzyme activities were highest at this point (data
not shown) and were undetectable before 48 h. We acknowledge that a static growth model
does not mimic the typical growth conditions for drinking water bacteria, but it was a necessary
experimental artifice to allow accumulation and subsequent measurement of exoenzymes.
Future work will examine biofilm formation by this community in a capillary ﬂow cell system,
similar to that described recently for another multi-species bioﬁlm [27].

We initiated the communities with all species at the same optical density within the well,
rather than the same number of cells (CFU/ml for 0.05 OD600 is reported in the Materials and
Methods Section). We Chose an approximately even initial community, as evenness has been
shown to favor functional robustness in multispecies bacterial communities [22]. We also
assessed the endpoint population proportions to better characterize this bioﬁlm community.
We exploited differential antibiotic sensitivities at different temperatures (see Table 1), which,
coupled to colony morphology and colony color, enabled enumeration of all species. The pro-
portions of each species in the complete community miX are shown in Table 2. Using basic

community ecological analyses, the endpoint community in the presence of all species has a
Simpson’s Index of 0.34, a ln-based Shannon Index of 1.92, and a Equitability Index of 0.87.

This nine membered model bacterial community is relatively simple compared to many nat-

urally occurring communities, although it is important to note that some natural extreme sys-
tems have fewer species [28]. Our goal in establishing a community with less than ten
members was to incorporate sufﬁcient diversity to give rise to abundant interactions but limit
the possible permutations to an experimentally tractable quantity. The latter property is critical
to dissect the molecular mechanisms governing enzyme production in the community. Using
Reed’s Law of community interaction [29], the number of unique interaction combinations in
a nine-membered community is 502. If we limit this to two and three-membered interactions,
a compromise between the maximum of Reed’s Law and the strictly pair-wise assumption of
Metcalfs Law, there are still a possible 120 unique interaction sets within our artiﬁcial commu-
nity. While we appreciate this is radically simpliﬁed compared to natural systems, it provides
sufﬁciently complex interactions to function as a tool for reductionist approaches.
Impact of community membership on lipase and protease activity
Bacterial exoenzymes are important contributors to ecosystem function [3] and secreted glyco-
sidases, glucosidases, and amidases have been particularly well-studied ([30, 31], among many
others). Lipases play important roles in acquisition of nutrients, particularly in waste water sys-
tems and food processing [9, 32, 33], but have been relatively understudied in relation to com-
munity composition. To understand the contribution of individual community members to
lipase production, we measured extracellular enzyme activity for short chain lipases (p-nitro-
phenylbutyrate, NPB), long chain lipases (p-nitrophenylpalmitate, NPP), and phosphatidyl-
choline-specific phospholipases C (p-nitrophenylphosphorylcholine, NPPC) from community
supernatants collected after 72 hours under static culture conditions. We measured the enzyme
activities for each individual species alone, the complete community of all nine species, and
multispecies collections each with one member absent from the community. It is important to
note that while phosphatidylcholine-specific phospholipase Cs have the highest specificity for

this substrate, other enzymes including phosphatases and esterases can hydrolyze NPPC [34].
Therefore, we have endeavored to describe on NPPC hydrolysis activity, regardless of source.

Overall enzyme production for both short and long chain lipases was robust to absence of
individual species, as demonstrated by the lack of statistically signiﬁcant changes to NPB and
NPP hydrolysis activity when any one species was left out of the community (Fig 1A and 1B,
left side of each graph). However, it was obvious that each species alone produced varying
enzyme activities (Fig 1A and 1B, right side of each graph). We observed functional robustness
in NPPC activity for most communities, however, absence of Chryseobacterium gleum caused a
substantial and signiﬁcant increase in the resultant NPPC hydrolysis activity of the community
(Fig 1C). We examined a potential mechanism for this change in hydrolysis activity in Section
3.5.

Like lipases, proteases have also been understudied from an ecological context in aquatic
ecosystems. Using the same strategy as for the three lipid hydrolysis activities, we observed
overall robustness of protease activity to absence of single species from these communities

alone (Fig 1D, right side of graph).
Liposome stability in community supernatants
One of our future goals is to study liposome interaction with this bioﬁlm community, however,
liposomes can also play a useful surrogate role as a model cell to study bacterial interactions
with cell membranes. The above enzymatic activities were based on hydrolysis of dissolved sub-
strates, whereas liposomes are more applicable as a potential cell-like target of such enzymes.
We used a liposome formulation that mimics eukaryotic cells (phosphatidylcholine-rich) and
measured the ability of secreted products to lyse these liposomes. We could measure n0 statisti-
cally signiﬁcant liposome lysis by the culture supernatants compared to heat-denatured super-
natant with liposomes as the negative control and Triton X-100 treatment as the positive
control (Fig 2). We allowed these incubations to proceed for four hours, which was a sufﬁcient
time to achieve saturation for all colorimetric reactions. Beyond this time we did note destabili-
zation of the liposomes, but this happened in the heat-denatured control as well, suggesting
there may be non-enzymatic components in the community supernatants.
Implications of lipase and protease robustness for microbial ecology
Many studies support the importance of species diversity in the establishment and stability of
ecosystems [reviewed in [35, 36]] and functional biodiversity in ecosystem reliability [21].

Additionally, species evenness has been demonstrated to contribute to community dynamics,
response to perturbations, and ecosystem functions [22, 37, 38]. Our study was not designed to
directly address these concepts and our method of community establishment was based on the
strategy from a single study on community evenness [22]. Given those caveats, our data gener-
ally support the extension of initial community evenness to extracellular lipase and protease
production. However, it is important to note, as with other studies on microbial evenness [22],
that the final community was much less even than the initial community (Table 2).

This study provides a partial examination of the effect of selective stress on a community;
that is, a stress that specifically removes one or more species without being stressful to the rest
of the community [39]. Specific examples in the natural world would be salt and desiccation
stress [40], species speciﬁc predation [41], phage infection [42], or antibiotic treatment [43].
Here, absence of a single species would mimic selective stress in terms of removal of live organ-
ism, but does not mimic the consequences of in situ death due to such stresses, including
released nutrients and altered bioﬁlm structure.

Our study focused on lipases and proteases, therefore our data is particularly inﬂuenced by
organisms producing the highest abundance of these products. In our community, it is impor-
tant to note that three species (B. cepacia, B. multivomns, and S. sanguinis) could produce high
levels of all the measured enzymes (Fig 1). Thus, removal of one of the three may not be
expected to dramatically alter total production. Functional redundancy in microbial (and
other) communities relates to robustness and has been termed the “insurance hypothesis” [44],
such that a community will always have the capability to express a critical function. Future
studies will examine the contribution of these three species to extracellular enzyme activities
and will allow us to directly test whether functional redundancy between these lipase producers
is responsible for the apparent robustness to species removal.

The above paragraphs describe the ecological underpinnings and consequences of robust-
ness without speciﬁcally addressing the molecular mechanisms. We have not examined these
mechanisms experimentally, but mechanism will be a target of future studies. We predict that
robustness of lipase and protease production is likely due to the mixed community having mul-
tiple control mechanisms to optimize resource acquisition [16, 45]. While we have not directly
examined the production of autoinducers or induction of quorum sensing in this bacterial
community, all isolates are from species that commonly encode quorum sensing systems (Via
searches of ICVI and SMART databases). Based on previous studies of dual species mixtures, it
is likely that both intraspecies and interspecies signaling will be taking place in this model sys-
tem [8, 11, 46, 47] and signal interference may play a key role in sculpting the final regulation
of community property [48, 49].

Examination of the C. gleum effect on NPPC hydrolysis activity

The only instance where secreted hydrolysis activity of the community was signiﬁcantly altered
by single species removal was for NPPC hydrolysis activity when C. gleum was excluded (Fig 1C).
Three species were abundant producers of NPPC hydrolytic activity on their own (Fig 1C, right
side of graph), therefore we examined whether C. gleum absence led to increased proportions of
one or more of these high-NPPC hydrolysis activity producers (S. sanguinis, B. multivorans, and
B. cepacia). To initially test this we took advantage of the fact that incubation at 37°C on Pseudo-
monas Isolation Agar allowed growth of only Burkholderia multivomns in this community. We
used serial dilution-based colony counts to quantify B. multivamns in the full mix under these
conditions, and the same conditions when C. gleum was absent, and observed no Change in col-
ony forming units between these conditions. We then used the differential plating strategy
described in the Materials and Methods to assess the community composition in the presence or

absence of C. gleam. We measured signiﬁcant increases in the proportions of Sphingomonas pau-
cimobilis, Sphingomonas sanguinis, and Burkholderia cepacia when C. gleum was removed
(Table 2). However, the proportional rise in the population of these species was not numerically
sufﬁcient to explain the rise in NPPC hydrolysis activity directly (see Fig 3C, -Cg vs.—Cg-known).
Basic ecological analyses of the community without C. gleam, based on the endpoint species pro-
portions (Table 2), shows that the community has a Simpson’s Index of 0.46, a ln-based Shannon
Index of 1.61, and a Equitability Index of 0.77.

Both Burkholderia species encode phospholipase C enzymes that are induced by choline
breakdown products [50—52] and therefore typify the well-described regulation by metabolic
intermediates [53, 54]. We could find no evidence in the literature that C. gleum synthesizes
choline 0r phosphatidylcholine de novo, but limited studies on C. gleum make that conclusion
uncertain. Therefore, a mechanism by which loss of C. gleum leads to increased NPPC hydroly-
sis activity remains elusive. It is possible that loss of C. gleum alters metabolism in the system
leading to choline 0r choline-containing compound synthesis in some other members. We do
know that the two Sphingomonads in the community can synthesize choline,

phosphatidylcholine, and the choline-containing lipid sphinglomyelin de novo [55]. Both of
the Sphingomonads increase in prevalence when C. gleum is absent (Table 2). While the strict
numerical increases in S. paucimobilis and S. sanguinis populations are not sufﬁcient to explain
the increased hydrolysis activity (see the next subsection), these increases in population com-
bined with alterations in metabolism could synergize to yield the increased activity. It is also
possible that these species, or a response of the community as a whole leads to the production
of esterases or phosphatases that also hydrolyze NPPC. Deletion of the phospholipase Cs in
one or more members of this community would be a way of directly addressing this issue in
the future.
Evaluation of the utility of calculated expected values
To understand the factors regulating exoenzyme production, it is important to generate some
simple expected values or numerical models that, minimally, account for differences in starting
or ﬁnal species composition within the community. This strategy is essentially a null hypothe-
sis generator that takes a simple set of assumptions regarding population structure and enzyme
production to predict the enzyme production levels in the mixed community. If all measured
activities match these simple predictions (expected values), then community enzyme produc-
tion is simply the sum of production from all members. This method is also a required prelude
to establishing a computational model of such processes.

We used the activity of each species grown in monoculture to generate an “expected” activ-
ity for each given community composition using two methods, and compared these values to
the actual activities measured from each community. The ﬁrst method calculates enzyme activ-
ities based on the fractional input proportions of each community member [22], while the sec-
ond calculates activity based on the fractional proportions measured after 72 h of static growth
(greater detail in Materials and Methods section). For most communities, the expected enzyme
activities are not equal to the measured activities, but the differences between actual and
expected values are similar for most community compositions (Fig 3A and 3B). However,
absence of Ralstonia pickettii, Cupriavidus metallidurans, or Chryseobacterium gleum each led
to a statistically signiﬁcant increase in the difference between actual and expected values com-
pared to the complete community for NPB hydrolysis activity. Additionally, absence of Phyllo-
bacterium myrsianaceamm led to a statistically significant decrease in the difference between
actual and expected values compared to the complete community in regard to NPP hydrolysis
activity (Fig 3B).

In contrast to the lipase data, all measured NPPC activities for the species mixes were much
lower than expected (Fig 3C). The direction and magnitude of this difference is due to the very
high NPPC hydrolysis activities measured for single species cultures of Sphingomonas sangui-
m's, Burkholderia multivomns, and Burkholderia cepacia driving the calculated expected value
higher.

When we subtract the expected protease activity from the measured activity, the full com-
munity and most of the multispecies communities with one species absent, have negative val-
ues (Fig 3D). This pattern is likely driven by high protease production by monocultures of
Sphingomonas sanguinis, Burkholderia multivomns, and Burkholderia cepacia, the same three
species with high NPPC hydrolysis activity when grown alone (compare the right sides of Fig
1C and Fig 1D). The only community with an (Actual—Expected) relationship that was signiﬁ-
cantly different from the full community was observed in the mix lacking Burkholderia cepacia
(Fig 3D).

Based on our calculations of the relationship between actual and expected enzyme activity
levels (Fig 3), neither the initial species proportions (most of the bars), nor the final species

proportions (MiX-K and Cg-K bars), correlate well with measured enzyme activities. The
exception is long-Chain lipase activity, where the ﬁnal species proportion in the—C. gleum com-
munity yields an expected value that is very Close to the actual value (Fig 3B). However, it can
be readily appreciated that the variations in expected values (Fig 3) do not directly correspond
to measured activity levels (Fig 1, left side of each graph). Therefore, one can hypothesize regu-
latory processes that sculpt ﬁnal enzymatic activity levels in the context of this community in
this experimental environment.

One of the caveats to this work, or any study involving many bacterial species in a commu-
nity, is that it is technically challenging to quantitatively know both the Viable and functional
populations of each organism throughout a particular experiment. Here, we have based our
predicted enzyme activity on the sum of the ﬁnal activity measures from each species divided
by their proportion at the beginning of the experiment, or their proportion at the end of the
experiment for two of the communities. Possibly due to the assumptions inherent in both
approaches [as acknowledged in [22] ], both sets of predicted values were equally far from the
actual enzyme activity values (F ig 3).

Conclusions

In conclusion, by quantifying exoenzyme production from a reconstructed model drinking-
water microbial community and assessing the impact of individual species absence, we have
described the functional robustness of lipase and protease production to species absence. This
bacterial community, being diverse yet limited in species number, may be a tractable model
community for identifying the mechanisms governing the regulation of community enzyme
production in drinking water bioﬁlms.

from the International Space Station Potable Water Delivery System (except for C. gleam, iso-
lated from the Russian SVO-ZV) and identiﬁed by the Microbiology Laboratory at the NASA
Johnson Space Center (Houston, TX) [23]. The strain numbers listed after each species are for
the strain database at the Johnson Space Center, and strains may be requested directly using
these designation for all species described herein. All bacteria were stored in 20% glycerol
stocks at -80°C and were streaked t0 R2A plates for recovery at 30°C.

All Chemicals and media components were purchased from Fisher Scientiﬁc 0r Sigma
Aldrich, except for p-nitrophenylphosphorylcholine (NPPC), which was purchased from
Setareh Biotech.

Community formation and preparation of supernatants for enzyme
activity measurement
Colonies from fresh R2A plates were grown in R2B medium overnight and used to inoculated
500 pl of 1/2 strength R2B (diluted with distilled water) in 48-well tissue culture plates for an ini-
tial OD600 of 0.05 for each community member for a ﬁnal community OD600 0f ~0.45. The
CFU/ml values at OD600 of 0.05 for each species with the exception of C. gleum were within 0.4
loglO units of each other, centered around 1E8 CFU/ml. This variance is Close to the technical

error level of our serial dilution plating (roughly 0.3 log10 in control counts). The CFU/ml for
C. gleum was 0.4 log10 units below the mean of the other species. The community was allowed
to form under static conditions (no shaking) at room temperature (20—23°C) for 72 h. This
community contained both planktonic and biofilm components. Supernatants from the com-
munity were gathered by resuspending the contents of each well Via Vigorous pipetting and
scraping of the well walls with the pipette tip. Since we were focused on products in the super-
natant, bulk removal was assessed Visually by crystal Violet staining. Compared to the biomass
removed, very little remained attached (<< 1%). At this point, an aliquot of the resuspended
community was removed for CFU counts and differential plating as described below. This ali-
quot was vortexed vigorously and disruption of clumps assessed by light microscopy. While
some clumps were present, they were not a substantial proportion of the population of cells.

To measure the effective OD600 from these wells, cells and debris were collected by centrifu-
gation at 14,000 X g and supernatant removed for enzymatic testing. The resulting pellet was
resuspended in R2B and the optical density at 600 nm was measured. All enzymatic activity
assays were conducted on cell-free supernatants prepared as described above. Therefore the
assays measure enzyme activity present at a single point in time (that of supernatant collection)
and cells were not exposed to the high concentrations of colorimetriC/ﬂuorometric substrates,
which would alter feedback regulation.

Differential plating

Bacteria were grown on a variety of antibiotics at either 30°C or 37°C to establish susceptibilities
that could be used for differential plating. These conditions and growth results are summarized
in Table 1. To establish colony counts for the mixed bioﬁlm community and the species removal
leading to altered NPPC hydrolysis activity, mixtures were plated on LBNS+suc (LB with no salt
and 5% sucrose) for total colony count, LBGm25 (gentamicin 25 pg/ml), and LBTplOO (trimetho-
prim 100 pg/ml). The LBTplOO enabled determination of the two Sphingomonas species, as 8. san-
guinis is resistant to trimethoprim and S. paucimobilis is susceptible. LBTplOO also enables
separation of the two Burkholderia species, as B. multivamns is susceptible and B. cepacia is resis-
tant to trimethoprim. Trimethoprim also allowed determination of P. myrsianaceamm com-
pared to all other white/beige colonies, as it grew well at 30°C on LBTplOO plates, while it could
not grow on gentamicin and also not at 37°C on any plate. C. gleum is a distinctive orange color,
easily distinguished from either Sphingomonad. Ralstonia insidiosa was distinguished from R.
picketii by the former’s resistance to gentamicin at 37°C. C. metallidumns and R. insidiosa are dis-
tinguished by the later having rough-edged colonies under these plate conditions.

Lipase activity assays

Choline headgroup-speciﬁc phospholipase C hydrolysis was measured using the NPPC assay
as previously described [56]. Brieﬂy, 100 pl of sample was added to 100 pl of 50% glycerol,

50 mM NaCl, and 20 mM NPPC. Produced nitrophenol was measured using absorbance at
410 nm in a Biotek Synergy2 plate reader and converted to units of PLC (ng/ml/min/OD600)
using the extinction coefficient of nitrophenol, 17,700/Cm.

Measurements of short and long chain lipase activity were done as per the NPPC assay with
p-nitrophenylbutyrate (NPB, short) or p-nitrophenylpalmitate (NPP, long) at 20 mM. For long
chain lipase activity, the NPP was first dissolved in acetone before resuspension in the reaction
buffer, which resulted in some NPP lost to insoluble material, but sufﬁcient NPP in solution
for rapid enzymatic determination. Hydrolysis was quantiﬁed as per the NPPC assay above.
Activities for NPB and NPP hydrolysis were higher than for NPPC hydrolysis and are reported
as pg/ml/min/OD600.

Liposome formation and liposome lysis measurements
Liposomes were generated Via the extrusion method based on the instructions and hardware speci-
ﬁed by Avanti Polar Lipids. Liposomes were composed of 4:1 (w/w) phosphatidylcholine and cho-
lesterol. Hydration was conducted in Dulbecco’s phosphate buffered saline (DPBS) in the presence
of 500 nM rhodamine and the mixture was extruded through a 0.2 pm membrane using 11 unidi-
rectional passes through the membrane. Liposomes were dialyzed in Slide-A-lyzer cassettes (20
kDa cutoff, Thermo Pierce) against DPBS to remove non-encapsulated rhodamine. These lipo-
somes were stable for at least 48 h at 4°C and all assays were done within this timeframe.

Liposome lysis was measured according to the general method used to measure liposome
stability [57]. Brieﬂy, we added 20 pl of liposomes to 200 pl of supernatant and took 20 pl ali-
quots at 30 min intervals for two hours. Each aliquot was diluted with 80 pl DPBS and intact
liposomes collected by centrifugation at 15,000 X g for 20 min. From the resulting supernatant,
50 pl was transferred to a white-walled 96-well microtiter dish and ﬂuorescence measured with
530/25 nm excitation and 590/35 nm emission ﬁlters using a Biotek Synergy2 plate reader. Pos-
itive control for liposome lysis was based on dissolution of the liposomes with Triton X-100
detergent at a ﬁnal concentration of 1%. This positive control was set as 100% lysis and lysis in
other conditions reported as % lysis. The negative control for lysis was incubation of liposomes
in heat-denatured supernatant. We also used, for comparison, supernatant from Pseudomonas
aeruginosa PAOl that secretes the protein hemolysis Pch (prepped as above) and addition of
puriﬁed Pch at 1 ng/pl, prepared as described [58].

Protease assay

Protease activity was measured using the Thermo Pierce Fluorescent Protease Assay Kit as
modiﬁed here. The supernatants from the bioﬁlm experiments were mixed with FITC-casein
substrate in the reaction buffer described for the lipase activity (25% glycerol, 25 mM NaCl
final concentrations). Fluorescence was read with 485/20 nm eXCitation and 528/20 nm emis-
sion ﬁlters using a Biotek Synergy2 plate reader immediately after assay start to measure base-
line autoﬂuorescence of the sample mixes and then after four hours incubation at room
temperature.

Statistical analysis and calculation of expected enzyme activities

For data in Figs 1—3, assays were run with three biological replicates in each of three indepen-
dent experiments on different days. All data was included in the graphs and variance plotted as
SEM. Statistical analysis was done using a one-way ANOVA with a Dunnett’s post-test where
the full species miX was the comparator, except for Fig 2 where liposomes in heat-denatured
supernatant was the comparator. For Table 2, a two-way ANOVA was used with a Sidak’s mul-
tiple comparisons test. These two tests were chosen as they are the most widely-used post-tests
for comparison of multiple groups to a single control group from one-way (Dunnett’s) and
two-way (Sidak’s) ANOVAs.

The expected values were generated using two methods, one based on the initial equal input
of bacteria [22], and the other based on the measured proportions of species within the bioﬁlm
at 72 h. For each method, we divided the enzyme activity measured from a single species bio-
ﬁlm by its fractional starting proportion in the assay (1/9th for the full miX, 1/8th for each miX
with a single species removed) or the proportion as measured at 72 h, and summed these cor-
rected activities for a given mixture. Thus, each mixture has a different expected enzyme value
based on the proportional contribution of the members.
