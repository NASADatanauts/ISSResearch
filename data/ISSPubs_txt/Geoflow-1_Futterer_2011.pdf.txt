Abstract. The spherical shell convection in the lower rotational regime is discussed with

numerical simulation by the use Of a pseudO—spectral code and experimental Observation by

the use Of a microgravity experiment in self—gravitating force ﬁeld. While a low Coriolis force

produces traveling waves of cubic, ﬁve—fold and frozen tetrahedral symmetry with a prograde

drift, in the transition zone to Chaos an axisymmetric ﬂow is Visible. The Chaotic ﬂuid ﬂow does

neither show a speciﬁc drift nor a dominating pattern of convection. Numerical and experimental

data are in a good agreement.
1. Introduction
Convection in self—gravitating spherical shells is of interest in geo— and astrophysical framework.
Regarding the summary of Schubert & Bereoviei (2009) and Schubert & Olson (2009) there exits
a rich variety of theoretical, numerical and experimental work on that topic. The geophysical
ﬂow simulation experiment ’GeOFlow’ studies such related convection phenomena in spherical
shells in a wide range of the rotating reference frame. For this, we consider a ﬂuid—ﬁlled spherical
shell, with the inner sphere heated and the outer sphere cooled, and, additionally, with the whole
system rotating on a tray. For the lowermost boundary of rotation, i.e. the non—rotational ease,
the system is very Clearly dominated only by the central symmetry buoyancy force. In ease of
the uppermost boundary, i.e. the rapid rotational regime, the Coriolis as well as the centrifugal
forces inﬂuence the ﬂow dynamics. Here we track the intermediate situation, where we expect
some kind of a competition of the forces. Aspects of patterns of convection for the non—rotational
case are initially described in Busse (1975). For the rapid rotation, Busse (2002) gives a review
on its contribution to dynamo action. For the slowly rotating spherical shells, Li et al. (2010)
discuss multiarmed spiral waves, if very large shells are considered. The physical basics for that
spherical Rayleigh—Bénard convection in the rotating reference system are introduced in the
following Section. Then we present the numerically simulated dynamics of the rotating cases
with focus on low and intermediate rotation regime, and ﬁnally, we verify our experimental data.
2. Physical Basics
For the buoyancy driven convection in incompressible Newtonian ﬂuids we consider the
Boussinesq approximation for the equations of continuity, impulse and energy (Chandrasekhar,
1981). In analogy to this temperature induced density Changes, there exists a temperature

induced Change for the permittivity e, if an alternating high voltage potential Wms is applied
between the system boundaries. Here we use this electro—hydrodynamie buoyancy for setting
up a self—gravitating force ﬁeld in miero—gravity experiments (Yavorskaya et al., 1984; Hart
et al., 1986). Then the non—dimensional equations for velocity ﬁeld U and temperature ﬁeld T,
resulting from rotating electro—hydrodynamie convection and including the centrifugal force, are
given by
V - U : 0, (1)
P771 [a—U + (U - V)U] : —Vp + V2U + Racentr - i Te).
(32: r5 (2)
—\/T—a.-éz >< U+ Ra - Trsinﬂéeq,
88—? + (U - V)T : V2T. (3)
The boundary conditions at the inner and outer spherical shells (index 73 and 0, respectively) are
of nO—slip type for U, and for T the values are set to T(n : 73/740) : 1 and T(1) : 0, if the non—
dimensional formulation is applied. Our equations are sealed with the outer spherical radius To
for length, the thermal diffusive time scale Ttherm : rg/K; for time, the term pOKL2/rg for pressure
and the temperature difference AT : TZ- — T0 for temperature, where K: is the thermal diffusivity
and p0 is the reference density. The geometrical and physical properties, discussed with the
radius ratio 77 : 73/740 and the Prandlt number Pr : V/KJ, respectively, are ﬁxed with 77 : 0.5
and Pr : 64.64. Refer to you Lareher et al. (2008) and Futterer et al. (2010) for a detailed
description of experiment parameters including the geometric dimensions as well as the physical
properties of the working ﬂuid, which is a silicone oil of Viscosity V, relative permittivity 67» and
coefﬁcient of dielectric expansion 7. Therewith ﬂuid dynamics of ’GeOFlow’ is described at sets
Of:
Rayleigh number Racentr : %, (4)

Taylor number Ta : (TO) , (5)

The Rayleigh number Racentr considers thermal effects with Racentr N AT. Coriolis force is
measured by the Taylor number Ta, with Ta N nN as the rotation rate of the sphere. Centrifugal
effects are counted with the additional factor Ra : aAT/4 - Pr - Ta, with the coefﬁcient of
volume expansion oz. This factor reaches the order of 106, if the maximum of AT : 10 K
and the maximal rotation rate n : 2 H z is set. Here we highlight the lower rotational regime
with the parameter domain for Ravcentr up to 1 - 105, and for the Taylor number we regard
2 - 102 3 Ta 3 1 - 104, resulting in Ra < 103. Therefore, at this case, the centrifugal effects can
be neglected.

3. Numerical simulation of traveling waves in lower rotating spherical shells

Our numerical simulation calculates solutions for the equation (1)—(3) at parameter sets of
Racentr and Ta with the pseudo—speetral code from Hollerbaeh (2000). For this, we will discuss
the numerically explored ﬂuid ﬂow dynamics in the following.

The truncations of serial expansion in spherical harmonies for both ﬁelds U and T in all
directions were (radial, meridional, azimuthal):(30,60,20). The time—stepping was set to 1-10—53.
The iteration was observed by means of logging the spectral coefﬁcients at arbitrarily Chosen
limbs of the serial expansion for a deeuple 0f the thermal time scale, i.e. 10 - Ttherm, within an

Figure 1. Numerical simulated, globally assessed amplitude convection for Racentr in lower
rotating spherical shells up to a Taylor number Ta 3 104. A steady state convection (c7 07
Q) is Characterized by constant kinetic energy and Nusselt number, respectively, and Chaos is
marked by irregularity in temporal behavior of that global variables Ekm (*). In addition, for
the steady state convection with properties of traveling waves, the symbol 0 corresponds to
axisymmetrie patterns of convection, while patterns in the region with o and Q are Visible with
complex symmetries, i.e. cubic, ﬂve—fold 0r tetrahedral as discussed in Fig. 2.
iteration of the solution is expected to stabilize. Those coefﬁcients are simply part Of the whole
solution, which is decomposed in spherical harmonies and act as local variables in all directions.
The overall time—dependeney is identiﬁed with the kinetic energy and the Nusselt number at the
inner and outer spherical shell:
7“ — r- 3T r- 3T
Nu : —T2WW—>NW:_7~—:(TC_MW (6)
Ekm : 0.5- f(ug + u3 + ui) #2 873MB) dr d6 dgb (7)
Then steady states show a constant kinetic energy with Ekm : const. and furthermore
N uz- : N uo. A periodic ﬂuid ﬂow shows periodic time series for these global variables of Ekm,
N uz- and N am which are no longer equal then. Irregular ﬂuctuating time—series mark Chaotic
solutions.

With our initial numerical simulation in Futterer & Egbers (2009) we describe Characteristics
of traveling waves as a quasi—stationary solution of our equations above. While the global
variables, such as the Nusselt number and the kinetic energy are constant, the azimuthal
components of the spectral coefﬁcients show a periodic drift. In Fig. 1 we plot that globally
assessed temporal behavior. While the traveling waves are marked as constant, one other type
of temporal ﬂuid motion, i.e. a Chaotic convection is Visible.

In the following, both, up to here only temporally Characterized, types of ﬂuid ﬂow are
discussed additionally with their behavior in space and their patterns of convection in Fig. 2.
There we have plotted for the very low rotation at Ta : 2 - 102 and for increasing the thermal

that, 011 the y—axis the amplitude of positive and negative velocity is Visible and, 011 the X—axis,
this mode is traced in time. For the lower Racentr a cubic and ﬁve—fold mode is Visible With 4
and 5 positive amplitudes at the onset of temporal observation Ttherm7i : 0. For increasing time
this amplitudes are extended to lines With a positive slope, Which represents a prograde drift,
i.e. the patterns are moved in the same direction as the rotation of the sphere. Moreover, the
patterns are neither stretched nor compressed. For highly supercritical Rayleigh number, the
mode of convection is of frozen tetrahedral type. Only in the Chaotic regime the tetrahedral

type dominates, but with a variation also in space not only in time.

All those patterns of convection are comparable to that in the ease of absence of rotation
and are Characterized by symmetry—breaking bifurcations as described in Feudel et al. (2011).
So we have in the middle and right half of the illustration in Fig. 2 the meridional velocity
component and the radial velocity component for the example of a cubic, ﬂve—fold, frozen
tetrahedral and varying tetrahedral pattern of convection with increasing Racentr. Hence a
low rotational inﬂuence only produces traveling waves with a prograde drift.

Finally, it remains to discuss the region of axisymmetrio convection modes as it is marked in
Fig. 1. These regions are in the part of increasing rotational inﬂuence, and one can state, that
this breaks the complex pattern before Chaotic convection occur. Moreover this is accompanied
by Changes of the sign for the drift velocity. So, the Chaotic regime does neither show speciﬁc
patterns of convection nor is there a distinct drift.

4. Convection experiments in lower rotating spherical shells

Our experiments on lower rotational convection in inner heated spherical shells are processed
in such a way, that the temperature difference AT (N Racentr) is set and the rotational rate n
(N Ta) is superimposed. For the stabilization of the ﬂuid ﬂow (corresponding to a numerical
iteration) only one single thermal time scale is practicable (due to experimental constraints).
For this, some speciﬁc numerically simulated set points are tracing the real experimentally
performed parameters additionally, if the temporal iteration is considered. Moreover the ﬂuid
ﬂow observation method has to be described. Here we use a Wollaston shearing interferometry,
which, basically, is sensitive to gradients of the refractive index. The measurement images
themselves show interference fringes, which correspond to the radially integrated temperature
ﬁeld (Futterer et al., 2010). Those images are construed in space and time in a more qualitative
way, here. Hence in a single squared image, we see a plane projection of part of the spherical
surface within the gap. In the illuminated Circle, as part of the squared image, we will ﬁnd
the northern pole of the experimental geometry in the top middle, while equatorial regions are
captured at the lower part of it. Dense lines of fringes correspond to a thermal bulk ﬂow,
separating either from the inner sphere or the outer one. In the following we will discuss, ﬁrst,
the numerically/experimentally temporal behavior at the end of a thermal diffusive time scale.
Then, secondly we will describe the fringe patterns of convection.

As a ﬁrst result, that ﬂuid ﬂow behavior is Characterized by a steady state and a Chaotic
convection again, as also plotted additionally in comparison with results of Section 3 in Fig. 3.
In the transition zone a transient convective behavior is observed, which delivers that the ﬂuid
ﬂow has not stabilized yet. The numerical and experimental sets are in a good agreement. For
the fringe patterns of convection, two topics are observed. First, the lowest Rayleigh number
regime show one single pattern, which only slightly Changes in comparison with the reference
patterns at the initial state. Secondly, in the higher Rayleigh number regime small scale fringes
occur. Here an increase of the rotation rate forces that fringes to be enhanced in the polar
region. Therewith the rotational inﬂuence and therewith the Taylor—Proudman theorem already
dominates in an intermediate rotation regime.

5. Outlook
The complementary approach from numerical simulation and experimental veriﬁcation still has
to be ﬁnalized by means of image processing techniques. One goal is to quantify also the drift
by tracking fringes in space and time.
