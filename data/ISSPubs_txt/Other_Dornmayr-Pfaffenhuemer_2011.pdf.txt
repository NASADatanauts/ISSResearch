Responses of Haloarchaea to Simulated MicrograVIty

Abstract
Various effects of microgravity 0n prokaryotes have been recognized in recent years, with the focus on studies of
pathogenic bacteria. N0 archaea have been investigated yet with respect to their responses to microgravity. For
exposure experiments on spacecrafts or on the International Space Station, halophilic archaea (haloarchaea) are
usually embedded in halite, where they accumulate in ﬂuid inclusions. In a liquid environment, these cells will
experience microgravity in space, which might inﬂuence their Viability and survival. Two haloarchaeal strains,
Halofemx mediterranei and Halococcus dombrowskii, were grown in simulated microgravity (SMG) with the rotary
cell culture system (RCCS, Synthecon). Initially, salt precipitation and detachment of the porous aeration
membranes in the RCCS were Observed, but they were avoided in the remainder of the experiment by using
disposable instead of reusable vessels. Several effects were detected, which were ascribed to growth in SMG: fo.
mediterranei’s resistance to the antibiotics bacitracin, erythromycin, and rifampicin increased markedly; differ-
ences in pigmentation and whole cell protein composition (proteome) of both strains were noted; cell aggre-
gation of Hcc. dombrowskii was notably reduced. The results suggest profound effects of SMG on haloarchaeal
physiology and cellular processes, some of which were easily observable and measurable. This is the first report
of archaeal responses to SMG. The molecular mechanisms of the effects induced by SMG 0n prokaryotes are
largely unknown; haloarchaea could be used as nonpathogenic model systems for their elucidation and in
addition could provide information about survival during lithopansperrnia (interplanetary transport of microbes
inside meteorites). Key Words: Halofemx mediterranei—Halococcus dombrowskii—Sirnulated microgravity—Rotary
cell culture system—Antibiotic resistance—Lithopanspermia. Astrobiology 11, 199—205.
