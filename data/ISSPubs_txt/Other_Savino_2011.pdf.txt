Abstract. SELENE (SELf rewetting ﬂuids for thermal ENErgy management) is a microgravity
experiment proposed to the European Space Agency (BSA) in response to the Announcement
of Opportunities for Physical Sciences. Main objectives of the microgravity research onboard
ISS include the quantitative investigation of heat transfer performances of “self—rewetting
ﬂuids” and “nano self—rewetting ﬂuids” in model heat pipes and validation of adequate
theoretical and numerical modelling able to predict their behaviour in microgravity conditions.
This article summarizes the results of ground-based research activities in preparation of the
microgravity experiments. They include: 1) thermophysical properties measurements; 2) study
of thermo—soluto-capillary effects in micro—channels; 3) numerical modelling; 4) thermal and
concentration distribution measurements With optical (e.g. interferometric) and intrusive
techniques; 5) surface tension-driven effects and thermal performances test on different
capillary structures and heat pipes; 6) breadboards development and support to deﬁnition of
scientiﬁc requirements.
1. Introduction
Two-phase ﬂow devices based on evaporation and condensation, surface tension and capillary effects,
are very frequently used as thermal energy management systems in many applications including
electronics cooling, air conditioning, propulsion, power generation, energy recovering, chemical
engineering. Research and development activities are generally concerned With development of
advanced heat pipes, vapour chambers or thermal ground planes for efﬁcient cooling of semiconductor
and integrated circuit devices, since energy dissipation becomes critical to their operation. In the space
applications, increase in size of space platforms and future exploration missions Will require a large

amount of heat to be dissipated by large space radiators. Efﬁcient thermal control in space and the
reduction of moving mechanical elements by two-phase closed-loop systems, becomes of crucial
importance.
The two most important objectives in electronics or other cooling engineering applications, namely the
reduction of the device maximum temperature and the minimization of temperature gradients on the
device surface, can be efﬁciently achieved by the use of micro-grooved heat pipes and/or selecting
suitable working ﬂuids.
The research activities presented in this paper deal various processes governing heat transport capacity
of the two-phase ﬂow devices and in particular on the heat transfer performances of binary or multi-
component heat transfer ﬂuids With particular surface tension, called “self—rewetting ﬂuids”, i.e.
liquids With a surface tension increasing With temperature and concentration. As pointed out in [1-9],
thermophysical properties, like surface tension, wettability and thermal conductivity, at different
temperatures, are of crucial importance not only for binary mixtures, but also for a number of ternary
aqueous solutions With relatively low freezing point and for nanoparticles suspensions. Some of them
interestingly eXhibit the same anomalous positive surface tension gradient With temperature as binary
self—rewetting solutions. Since in the course of liquid/vapour phase change, self—rewetting ﬂuids
behaviour induces a rather strong liquid inﬂow (caused by both temperature and concentration
gradients) from the cold region (Where liquid condensates) to the hot evaporator region, several
interesting space and terrestrial applications may be envisaged [10].
In this general framework, a cooperative international project supported by BSA and JAXA is under
development to contribute to the understanding of the basic ﬂuid dynamic and physico-chemical
mechanisms occurring in these multi-component two-phase systems and particularly on the interplay
between heat transport and surface and bulk thermophysical properties. To pursue the above obj ective,
the behaviour of non-isothermal self—rewetting liquids Will be experimentally investigated onboard the
International Space Station under microgravity conditions.
This article is organized as follows. The general scientiﬁc and technological motivations and concepts
of the microgravity experiment SELENE are summarized in section 2, including main objectives,
preliminary design concepts and requirements and description of the experimental procedure.
Fundamental theoretical, experimental and numerical results of ground activities on the subject are
summarized in the next paragraphs. In particular, laboratory results achieved on ground are presented,
including thermophysical properties measurements, ﬂow Visualization experiments With transparent
cells, optical and interferometric analyses. F inal comments Will conclude the article.
2. SELENE Experiment on ISS
SELENE (SELf rewetting ﬂuids for thermal ENErgy management) is a microgravity experiment
proposed to the European Space Agency (BSA) in response to the Announcement of Opportunities
(A0 2009) for Physical Sciences. The proposal received a favourable scientiﬁc and technical review
and selected for inclusion in the ELIPS research pool, approved by the ESA Programme Board for
Human Spaceﬂight, Microgravity and Exploration. The project is carried out under a cooperative
ESA-JAXA programme.
The main objectives include the quantitative investigation of heat transfer performances of self-
rewetting ﬂuids in model heat pipes and validation of adequate theoretical and numerical modelling
able to predict their behaviour in microgravity conditions. Once the models have been validated, they
can be extended and applied also to terrestrial applications.
Microgravity offers the opportunity to avoid gravity effects and to analyse in detail typical ﬂow
patterns occurring only in the space environment, in relatively large systems, offering the opportunity
to perform systematic experimental investigations of the processes, considering a large number of
experimental conditions typical of space and terrestrial heat pipes. For this reason the experiments
Will use transparent test cells, to allow direct ﬂow Visualization, coupled With optical and intrusive
diagnostic techniques to measure thermal/compositional ﬁelds.

The implementation of pairs of heat pipe cells could allow the parallel study of two liquids
simultaneously or sequentially, but in the same conﬁguration and settings.
Each cell represents a half—heat pipe model With one groove of appropriate cross section shape and
size machined into the bottom surface. The heat pipe cells are prepared on-ground and ﬁlled With the
experiment liquid. The cells may also include certain (mostly intrusive) measurement devices, such as
thermal sensors. The top Window of the heat pipe cell is transparent, Which enables the use of various
optical diagnostics (infrared observation, interferometry). Furthermore, optionally velocimetry
measurements shall be possible as well. In each heat pipe cell temperature and concentration sensors
shall provide local measurements of the liquid properties.
For each heat pipe, evaporation is promoted at the hot side (evaporator) With a controllable heat input
While the temperature at the other end (condenser) should be controlled and kept at a lower value. For
a given temperature difference, corresponding to a prescribed thermal power, the evaporated liquid
Will condense at the cold side Where heat Will be removed and the liquid condensate Will be driven
back to the evaporator ﬂowing along the channel by the capillary effect and/or by the inverse
Marangoni effect. The heat input (evaporator) and the temperature (condenser) can then be ﬁne-tuned

With dedicated elements. The investigation of the evaporation and condensation-driven behaviour of
the liquid in this cell, When subj ected to different heat stimuli is the main obj ective 0f the experimental
research.
Main experiment scientiﬁc required measurements include:
° heat power provided at the evaporator section
° heat exchanged at the condenser section
° temperature distributions along the 1iquid-vap0ur interface and in the liquid at different
positions along the cell, from the evaporator t0 the condenser
° concentrations in the liquid at different positions along the cell, from the evaporator t0 the
condenser
° liquid distribution and in particular ﬁlm thickness and shape of the 1iquid-vap0ur interface
from the evaporator t0 the condenser using Visual observation and quantitative analysis (e.g.
interferometric techniques) during heat pipe operations, i.e. from relatively low power up to
the dry-out limit for the different investigated working ﬂuids
° ﬂow Visualization shall be considered also for liquid velocity measurements
A layout of a possible experimental heat pipe cell is shown in ﬁgure 2. It shall include in the “bottom
surface” part a metallic surface (copper or aluminium) With a dedicated hydro- and oleophilic channel
(groove) connecting the evaporator t0 the condenser in the nominal conﬁguration. Nevertheless,
different surface structures shall be possible as well.
The shape and size of the channel shall be designed according to the maximum thermal power and
heat ﬂux density to be representative of ordinary heat pipes.
As a baseline, the bottom surface of the groove shall be prepared With very small roughness (like an
optical mirror) or eventually coated (e.g. With silver or gold) in such a way that the optical quality
allows interferometric measurements in reﬂection mode. Nevertheless, certain samples With different
surface roughness and/or structuring Will be also foreseen (Without interferometric measurements).
The opposite surface of the cell (“top Window” in ﬁgure 2) shall be made of an optically transparent
material With relatively high thermal conductivity (e.g. sapphire).

liquid refractive indeX Will be considered, in order to evaluate the liquid concentration once the
temperature is known.
CCD, Infrared Camera and Interferometric analysis Will complete the investigation of the basic ﬂuid
physics mechanisms occurring in the heat pipe model, to detect the liquid fraction distribution Within

3. Ground-based research activities
In What follows, a number of ground research activities, in preparation of the microgravity research,
Will be summarized.
3.1. Characterization 0ftherm0physicalproperties ofselfrewettingﬂuids and nanoﬂuids
As discussed in [11], main thermophysical properties of interest for utilization of self—rewetting ﬂuids
in thermal energy management devices include surface tension, contact angle, latent heat of
vaporization, thermal conductivity, freezing point. These properties have been investigated for a
number of binary and multi-component self—rewetting solutions including water-alcohol solutions
(based on Butanol, Pentanol, Exanol, Heptanol, tee.) as well as in low freezing point mixtures (brines)
With relatively low concentrations of the same alcohols [11]. Comparison between different working
ﬂuids show that generally self—rewetting ﬂuids eXhibit better performances in terms of surface tension
and wetting behaViour, in comparison to the base liquids. F urthermore, preliminary tests on heat pipes
in different conﬁgurations pointed out better thermal performances When self -rewetting ﬂuids or self-
rewetting brines are used to replace common heat transfer ﬂuids like water.
Particular attention has been dedicated to the study of the thermophysical properties of nanoﬂuids
based on water/alcohol solutions. They include self—rewetting nanoﬂuids based on silver or gold
nanoparticles or nanoﬂbers [9], or nanoﬂuids With suspended carbon nanostructures, in particular
single-wall carbon nanohorns [12].
In [9] the authors have shown that “self—rewetting nanoﬂuids” containing aqueous-butanolic solution
With microwave-assisted synthesized silver nanoparticles eXhibit dryout limits in heat pipes almost
twice as high as that of base working ﬂuid heat pipe and this could be explained by the enhancement
of the surface tension gradients With temperature, due to the dependencies changes of silver nano-self—
rewetting ﬂuids. Since these self—rewetting nanoﬂuids contained very dilute silver nanoparticles, other
therrnophysical properties such as thermal conductivity and Viscosity were almost same as those of
base ﬂuid.
Another research line was dedicated to self—rewetting nanoﬂuids prepared suspending, in butanol-
Water solutions, single wall carbon nanohorns (SWNH), produced by are discharge [12]. In this case,
surface tensions measurements reveal the self—rewetting behaViour of the nanoﬂuids as the self-
rewetting base solutionshave shown that the presence of the carbon nanoparticles does not affect the
surface tension and contact angles properties of these ﬂuids, in comparison to the corresponding base
ﬂuid, i.e. a binary butanol aqueous solution. On the other hand, thermal conductivity measurements
performed With the parallel plate technique pointed out a signiﬁcant enhancement of the equivalent
thermal conductivity due to the presence of the carbon nanohorns.
Preliminary heat transfer analysis of heat pipes ﬁlled with self—rewetting nanoﬂuids based on carbon
nano-horns conﬁrm improved performances in comparison to other self—rewetting ﬂuids.
3.2 F [0w visualization and interferometric analysis
Research activities have been focused on numerical simulations and laboratory experiments in
transparent cells for the Visualization and analysis With optical diagnostic systems of ﬂuid ﬂows in
presence of thermal gradients.

Some basic ﬂuid-dynamic mechanisms related to the behaviour of Wickless transparent heat pipes With
self-rewetting ﬂuids have been investigated in [6]. In particular, the interesting behaviour of “inverse”
thermocapillary bubble migration was pointed out (see ﬁgure 3) in transparent capillary tubes,
showing the different Marangoni effect in self—rewetting ﬂuids compared to ordinary liquids. This
phenomenon has been discussed to show the potential advantages of the new working ﬂuids and
conﬁrmed by the thermal characterization of Wickless heat pipes ﬁlled With water and With self-
rewetting ﬂu1ds

Experiments With binary solutions of water and long-chain alcohols have conﬁrmed the different
boiling behaviour in heat pipes ﬁlled With self—rewetting ﬂuids in comparison to pure water [6].
For the self—rewetting ﬂuid the evaporation region contains more liquid in comparison to water, Which
also implies spontaneous liquid supply to higher temperature region and vapour slug behaviour near
the heating region implies a rather strong shear stress between vapour and liquid ﬁlm.
In [13] thin optically transparent cuvettes With lateral heating allowed the development of a nearly 2D
ﬂow, good thermal boundary conditions and minimization of the liquid meniscus; in addition this
conﬁguration is similar to typical deVices for heat transfer applicationsThe target of the experiments
was to observe the Marangoni ﬂow driven by the thermal and solutal gradients along the liquid-vapor
interface. The investigated ﬂuids include two ordinary liquids (water and ethanol) and water/alcohols
mixtures (self—rewetting ﬂuids), in particular water-butanol 5%Wt, water-heptanol 0.2%Wt.
As discussed in [13], for self—rewetting solutions, due to the evaporation—condensation phenomena,
both thermo-capillary and solutal Marangoni effects are present. Indeed, any imposed temperature
difference along a liquid-vapour interface creates a surface concentration gradient, alcohol evaporates
in the hot region of the surface and condensation occurs at the cold side. For this purpose, ﬂow
Visualization experiments have been accomplished using optical diagnostic systems, in particular, a
parallel background illumination system to Visualize tracer particles and a two wavelength Mach-
Zehnder interferometer. The latter technique allows one to evaluate, once the temperature and
concentration dependence of the refraction indeX is known at each wavelength, the temperature and
concentration proﬁles. In this way the different contributions related to thermo-capillary and solute-
capillary effects can be independently evaluated. In particular, based on the measured surface tension
derivatives for the different binary solutions investigated, the different driving actions have been
predicted from the temperature and concentration distributions, for a positive mixture (like water-
ethanol) and a self—rewetting water-butanol solution.
The measured temperature and concentration maps shown in ﬁgures 4 and 5 point out that, as

expected, in pure liquids ordinary Marangoni ﬂow is directed towards the cold side, but self—rewetting
solutions eXhibit a self—rewetting behaviour, i.e. liquid at the interface directed towards the hot side. In
particular, the surface velocity, directed from the cold (left) towards the warm (right) side is
responsible for an evident “inverse” deformation of the isotherms at the 1iquid-vapor interface. The
numerical results are in agreement With the experimental results. Further details can be found in [13].

3.3 T hearetical and numerical activities
Preliminary theoretical and numerical simulations are in progress at the University of Naples to
identify the geometry and experimental conditions for the ISS experiment. In particular, the main
objective is the development of analytical or numerical models able to predict the dry-out (capillary)
limit of microchannels in microgravity, in order to identify the expected experimental conditions.
A model for ﬂuid ﬂow and heat transfer in the micro-channel of arbitrary V-shaped cross section has
been developed due to evaporation and condensation. The liquid meniscus radius changes With
position in a micro-channel, and the liquid pressure is given by the Young-Laplace equation.The
model allows one to evaluate the dry-out limit of micro-channels With different cross section.
The model equations [14] are based on the following assumptions: (i) one dimensional steady
incompressible ﬂow along the length of heat pipe; (ii) uniform distribution of heat input; (iii)
negligible heat dissipation due to Viscosity; (iv) constant pressure in the vapor region in the operating
range of temperature; (V) one dimensional temperature variation along the length of heat pipe; (Vi)
negligible shear stress at the 1iquid-vapor interface (zero Marangoni effect); complete wetting of the
1iquid(zero contact angle).
The heat pipe has three sections — the evaporator takes up dissipated heat, the condenser releases the
heat to the surroundings, and the adiabatic section transports the heat from the evaporator to the
condenser. Due to evaporation and condensation, the liquid meniscus radius changes With position in a
micro-channel, and the liquid pressure is given by the Young-Laplace.
The pressure difference generates the capillary pumping for the liquid ﬂow from the condenser to the
evaporator. In particular, the liquid is pushed from the cold end to the hot end due to decrease in the
radius of curvature caused by the intrinsic meniscus receding into the corner. The liquid ﬁlm gradually
becomes thinner and more curved (lower radius of curvature) as the liquid recedes further towards the
apex of the corner (see ﬁgure 6).

The analytical model provides the equation for the dimensionless curvature radius as function of the
local coordinate and 0f the input power at the evaporator, if the ﬂuid properties (Viscosity, surface
tension, latent heat, etc.) are known. Furthermore, the critical heat input (Q67) i.e. the maximum heat
transport capacity of a micro-grooved heat pipe, Without generating any hot spot in the heat pipe, can

be evaluated.
In particular, according to order of magnitude scaling analysis, the maximum dimensionless heat ﬂux
at the evaporator/condenser (sealed with reference thermophysical ﬂuid properties) is proportional to
the square of the groove depth (a) to length (L) ratio:

F igures 10, 11 and 12 show different CF D results, considering a channel partially ﬁlled With water. It
is interesting to see the different liquid distributions corresponding to different input power and
different wetting behaviour. In particular ﬁgure 10 refers to a the case of a relatively low input power
(Q=10W) When the liquid completely wets the bottom channel. The liquid volume decrease from the
condenser t0 the evaporator but the capillary pressure is enough to sustain liquid return avoiding dry-
out. F igure 11 shows the result for a power Q=100W. In this case the liquid content at the evaporator

side is less than in the previous case, but a liquid ﬁlm is still present.
For the same conditions if the liquid exhibit poor wetting properties (see ﬁgure 12) the condensated
liquid is accumulated at the cold side and the evaporator becomes completely dry.

4. Experimental activities
Experimental investigations include the study of heat transfer performance of heat pipes using
water/alcohol mixtures and different set up and conﬁgurations. These laboratory experiments
speciﬁcally explore the use of self—rewetting ﬂuids, self—rewetting brines and self—rewetting
nanoﬂuids. A number of results can be found, e.g. in [10-12].
In addition, in preparation of SELENE ﬂight experiment, ground-based experimental activities Will be
carried out to identify the ﬂight experimental liquids and concentrations, the requirements for the
development of the ﬂight hardware and the diagnostic systems. Different ground-based experiments
are in progress (see ﬁgure 13). An experimental breadboard cell has been developed in order to study
the preliminary conﬁguration and setup, to identify possible problems and corresponding solutions.
In particular, ground-based experiments include stability of surface properties, material compatibility
test between liquid and materials, diagnostics for evaluation of distribution of liquid and surface
reconstruction (ﬁlm shape and thickness measurements With interferometric techniques), concentration
measurements With intrusive (optical probes) and optical techniques, such as-two-wavelength Mach-
Zhender interferometer, nanoﬂuids characterization including study of nanoﬂuids stability, particles
shape and size control.

5. Conclusions
The scientiﬁc requirements of SELENE ISS experiment Will be deﬁned through theoretical and
numerical analyses, as well as ground-based experimental activities. The main objectives include
identiﬁcation of experimental liquids, requirements for the ﬂight hardware and diagnostic systems.
Current research activities include: characterization of thermophysical properties of self.rewetting
ﬂuids and nanoﬂuids, ﬂow Visualization and interferometric analysis in relatively simple geometrical
conﬁgurations to show fundamental behaviour, development of numerical tools and experiments With
breadboard cells. Some of the most important results have been summarized in this article.
Other experiments are in progress, including also activities dedicated to the characterization of
intrusive methods for measurements of concentration and temperature proﬁles. Detailed theoretical
and numerical studies and comparisons With experimental results Will be carried out in the future.
Particular attention Will be focused on the heat transfer mechanisms in grooves of different shapes and
size, to properly deﬁne the ﬂight experimental conﬁguration, also considering requirements of
quantitative investigation of the liquid distributions in microchannels using optical techniques.
