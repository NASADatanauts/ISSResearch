Abstract: The Hyperspectral Imager of the Coastal Ocean — HICO® — is a Visible and

near—IR grating spectrometer currently in orbit on the International Space State (188) [l].

HICO’s 5.7 nm (binned) spectral resolution permits the application of derivative spectroscopy

to the identiﬁcation of remotely sensed water constituents. We examine applications of

derivative spectroscopy to complex coastal waters with riverine inputs such as the Columbia

and Yangtze rivers.

1. Background
Remote sensing ocean imagers are designed to capture a dark object (water) in a bright background (atmosphere). The
current generation of ocean imagers are ‘Inultispectral,’ and product algorithms are tuned to make use of the of the
distinct spectral channels. As demonstrated by HICO [2] , however, current technology permits the design of low—noise
space bourne spectrometers with continuous spectral coverage, as well as enhanced spatial coverage. HICO’s typical
ground sampling distance is 90 meters with a native spectral resolution of 1.9 nm, which is typically binned up to 5.7
nm. Useable spectral coverage ranges from 400 nm to 900 nm.

Derivative spectroscopy is a useful technique for the routine analysis of laboratory spectra. Derivative spectroscopy
is also useful in the identiﬁcation of informative remote sensing channels to aid the design of multispectral imagers [3],
and initial applications also show its utility in the identiﬁcation of shallow water bottom types [4].

Multispectral imagers focus on the extrema spectra of water or atmospheric constituents. Hyperspectral instruments
and derivative spectroscopy allows us to quantify the shape and curvature of spectral peaks as well. For instance, the
half—width of a ﬂuorescence peak is ampliﬁed by the use of derivative spectroscopy. A peak with a smaller half—width
will have a larger derivative around the maximum, and this spectral feature which is emphasized in the derivative can
be used to distinguish and identify spectral features.

Care must always be taken in the numerical computation of derivaties to minimize the the impact of noise ampli—
ﬁcation. We compute the derivatives using a SaVitzky—Golay ﬁlter [5]. At the same time we interpolate the data to a
uniform 5 nm spacing. HICO has a signal—to—noise (SNR) of about 400 in the blue and 200 in the red [2]. To further re—
duce the noise in the data, where appropriate, we spatially bin the data to larger pixel sizes to further increase the SNR.
Spectral features are identiﬁed by ﬁrst looking at the extrema and zero crossings of the derivatives, but further analysis
also includes the calculation of principal components to try to match the remote sensing spectra to lab measurements
of probable minerals or pigments [6].

2. Applications

As a ﬁrst example we examine an image of the Columbia River from May 2012 (Fig. l). The fourth derivative is
often used since it has the same extrema as the original spectra (the second derivative also has the same extrema but
with the minimums and maximums interchanged). Pixels are chosen which are thought to represent different water
masses, and the derivative is examined (Fig. l (c)) to ﬁnd features that are used to distinguish the water masses. Then
these channels can be chosen for the RGB composite to highlight differences. In this example it appears that that there
are three distinct water masses, presumably occurring from sediments at three distinct depths due to tidal forcing.
Choosing, for instance, a channel near 610 nm allows us to separate older water outﬂowing from the Columbia (red
dot in Fig. l (a)) from newer water (green dot in Fig. 1(a)). Picking RGB channels to separate water masses results
in the image Fig. 1(b). Thus, in this very simple application, we illustrate how a derivative signature can be used for
image enhancement.

As a second example consider the sediment rich outﬂow from the Yangtze river in March of 2012 (Fig. 2). The
average total dissolved solids (TDS) out of the Yangtze exceeds 250 mg/L, and causes a tan colored fan shape in the
East China Sea easily seen from space. Atmospherically corrected spectra are shown in Fig. 2 (b). Salient features such
as a peak of 800 nm from bottom reﬂectance and a peak at about 710 nm from a surface algal matte are highlighted in
the second derivative (Fig. 2(C)). Although the bottom reﬂectance is easy to see in the original spectra (Fig. 2(b)), the
710 nm peak is not readily apparent, but is prominent in the second derivative plot (Fig. 2(C)).
