Figure 1. Survival of tardigrades and tardigrade eggs under space conditions.
(A,B) Post-flight survival in space-exposed tardigrades as a function of time after rehydration. (A) R. coronifer. (B) M. tardigradum. Tardigrades
were exposed to space vacuum (SV), space vacuum and UV 280—400 nm (SV+UVA,B), and space vacuum and UV 116.5—400 nm (SV+UVA._._).
Controls were kept under ambient laboratory conditions. Animals were recorded as vital if showing coordinated leg movements. Data represent
mean i 1 s.e.m. for four replicate samples. Time = 0 on the x-axis represents 2 hours post-rehydration. Data for SV+UVALL were excluded from
(A) because no specimens of R. coronifer in this category revived. In general, controls and vacuum-exposed tardigrades survived equally well
in both species (Mann-Whitney test, p > 0.05 in all comparisons except for one estimate in R. coronifer: day 23, U = 1, p = 0.043). Survival of
samples exposed to SV+UVALL were significantly different from controls and vacuum-exposed samples in M. tardigradum (p < 0.05 in all com-
parisons). (C,D) Post-flight hatching success of eggs of the tardigrades Richtersius coronifer and Milnesium tardigradum. (C) Rate of hatching
of eggs laid by animals exposed to space vacuum (SV) and for controls. Data represent mean i1 s.e.m. for 4 replicate samples, each with 9-26
freely laid eggs (R. coronifer) or 5—30 exuvia with eggs (M. tardigradum). Since only one of the UVAB replicate samples produced exuvia with
eggs, no standard error is given for this group. Exposure groups did not differ statistically in either R. coronifer (Mann-Whitney test; U = 8.0,
p = 1.0) or M. tardigradum (Nested ANOVA, F(2,154) = 0.14, p = 0.87). (D) Rate of hatching of eggs directly exposed to space vacuum (SV) and
for controls. No light-exposed eggs hatched. Data represent mean i 1 s.e.m. for 4 replicate samples, each with 9—26 eggs (R. coronifer) or 16—50
eggs (M. tardigradum). Exposure groups did not differ statistically in either R. coronifer (Mann-Whitney test; U = 10, p = 0.56) or M. tardigradum
(U = 7, p = 0.77).
