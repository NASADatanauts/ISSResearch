Assessing bacterial behavior in microgravity is important for risk assessment and prevention of infectious
diseases during spaceﬂight missions. Furthermore, this research ﬁeld allows the unveiling of novel connections
between low-ﬂuid-shear regions encountered by pathogens during their natural infection process and bacterial
Virulence. This study is the ﬁrst to characterize the spaceﬂight-induced global transcriptional and proteomic
responses of Pseudomonas aeruginosa, an opportunistic pathogen that is present in the space habitat. P.
aeruginosa responded to spaceﬂight conditions through differential regulation of 167 genes and 28 proteins,
with qu as a global transcriptional regulator. Since qu was also differentially regulated in spaceﬂight-grown
Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium, qu represents the ﬁrst spaceﬂight-induced regulator acting across
bacterial species. The major P. aeruginosa Virulence-related genes induced in spaceﬂight were the lecA and lecB
lectin genes and the gene for rhamnosyltransferase (rhlA), which is involved in rhamnolipid production. The
transcriptional response of spaceﬂight-grown P. aeruginosa was compared with our previous data for this
organism grown in microgravity analogue conditions using the rotating wall vessel (RWV) bi0react0r. Inter-
esting similarities were observed, including, among others, similarities with regard to qu regulation and
oxygen metabolism. While RWV-grown P. aeruginosa mainly induced genes involved in microaerophilic me-
tabolism, P. aeruginosa cultured in spaceﬂight presumably adopted an anaerobic mode of growth, in which
denitriﬁcation was most prominent. Whether the observed changes in pathogenesis-related gene expression in
response to spaceﬂight culture could lead to an alteration of Virulence in P. aeruginosa remains to be
determined and will be important for infectious disease risk assessment and prevention, both during space-
ﬂight missions and for the general public.

The microgravity environment associated with spaceﬂight is 46—49). In response to the spaceﬂight environment, global
