Abstract—The results of analysis of microdisturbanees 0n the International Space Station (155) at performing
various dynamic operations are presented. Docking 0ftransfer manned and cargo vehicles Progress and Soyuz
to various docking modules of the ISS, docking 0f the Space Shuttle Discovery, the [SS orbit correction and,
also, disturbances at “EVA” (Extra Vehicular Activity) operations during astronauts working on the external
[SS surface are considered. The results of measuring microaccelerations by sensors of both Russian and
American segments are analyzed.
