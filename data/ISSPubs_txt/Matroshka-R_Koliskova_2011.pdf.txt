Abstract
The health risks associated with exposure to various components of space radiation are of great
concern when planning manned Iong-term interplanetary missions, such as future missions to
Mars. Since it is not possible to measure the radiation environment inside of human organs in
deep space, simulations based on radiation transport/interaction codes coupled to phantoms of
tissue equivalent materials are used. However, the calculated results depend on the models
used in the codes, and it is therefore necessary to verify their validity by comparison with
measured data. The goal of this paper is to compare absorbed doses obtained in the
MATROSHKA-R experiment performed at the International Space Station (ISS) with simulations
performed with the three-dimensional Monte Carlo Particle and Heavy-Ion Transport code
System (PHITS). The absorbed dose was measured using passive detectors (packages of
thermoluminescent and plastic nuclear track detectors) placed on the surface of the spherical
tissue equivalent phantom MATROSHKA-R, which was exposed aboard the ISS in the Service

"

assuming an ISS shielding of Cag/cm2 anol 5g/cm2 aluminum mass thickness were in good
agreement with the measurements. Using a simplified geometrical model of the ISS, the
influence of variations in altitude and wall mass thickness of the ISS on the calculated absorbed
dose was estimated. The uncertainties of the calculated data are also discussed; the relative
expanded uncertainty of absorbed dose in phantom was estimated to be 44% at a 95%

Introduction

It is well known that space radiation represents a major hazard to crew members on long-
duration manned space missions both, at the ISS and on the planned interplanetary missions to
Mars. It is therefore important to be able to predict deterministic as well as stochastic radiation
effects. Deterministic effects are observed only at doses above a threshold and their severity
increases with dose, while stochastic effects do not seem to have a threshold and their severity
is not directly dependent on the dose. The estimation of biological effects is very complicated
and has large uncertainties. Using quality factors based on LET spectra absorbed doses are
converted into olose equivalents, which in turn are converted into risk using appropriate risk
coefficients. Although knowledge of the dose is not sufficient for estimating the biological effects
of radiation, it is an important component for the estimation. The absorbed dose on board of
space vehicles can either be measured or calculated using particle and heavy-ion transport
codes. However, in some cases it may be very difficult or even impossible to directly measure
the dose for all possible systems and therefore reliable and accurate particle and heavy-ion
transport codes are needed. Since these codes are able to simulate transport of various
particles in very complex geometries, they can also be used to design and optimize radiation
shielding. However, the reliability of the code predictions depends on the models used to
estimate the quantities necessary for the transport calculation.

The dose distribution inside a spacecraft is a result of primary and secondary space radiation. In
low-Earth orbit (LEO) (see e.g. NCRP:132, 2000; E.R. Benton and E.V. Benton, 2001), three
main sources of primary ionizing radiation are considered: (1) galactic cosmic rays (GCRs),
which are composed of 87 °/o protons, 12 °/o helium and about 1 °/o heavier ions, with an energy
spectrum peak at approximately 1 GeV/u; (2) electrons and protons trapped by the Earth's
magnetic field (Van Allen belts) and (3) solar particle events - injections of charged particles
(electrons, protons, helium and heavier ions) into the interplanetary space from the Sun. When
passing through the walls of a spacecraft, the materials inside it, and the human body itself, the
primary particles may undergo nuclear reactions producing a number of different secondary
particles. Consequently, the radiation field on board of a spacecraft consists of various types of
particles with a wide range of energies and is very complex, differing greatly from the outside
field. The accuracy of simulated oloses received by crew members inside a space vehicle is not
only dependent on the models used for the estimation of the radiation environment in space and

"
"4","the geometry of the spacecraft, but also on the accuracy of the reaction and interaction models
used in the particle and heavy-ion transport codes. It is thus important that, in addition to
experiments performed in space, these models are carefully benchmarked against ground
based accelerator experiments with well characterized beams and geometries.

The absorbed dose of a crew member in a spacecraft depends on many parameters. The most
important parameters at LEO are the orbit parameters of the spacecraft (inclination and
altitude), the solar cycle phase, and the thickness and material of the shielding. Radiation
monitoring during long-term space missions aboard the MIR anoI ISS demonstrates that
the crew member dose can be as high as 0.1 to 0.3 Sv after a one year space flight, i.e. about
0.3 to 0.8 mSv/d (Shurshakov et a|., 2008, NCRP:132, 2000). Since cosmic radiation represents
a serious health risk for astronauts, especially during long-term missions, it is important to be
able to estimate the received dose as accurately as possible.

Using different models for the external space radiation environment coupled with a three-
dimensional particle and heavy-ion transport code with a simplified geometry of the ISS, this
paper presents an evaluation of a method for estimation of the absorbed dose received by crew
members at LEO. The PHITS calculated absorbed dose distributions on the surface of the
Russian spherical phantom located aboard the ISS are compared with measurements
performed in the frame of the MATROSHKA-R space experiment (Akatov et a|., 2007;
Shurshakov et a|., 2008). Furthermore, the influence of various parameters such as shielding
thickness and altitude of the ISS on the results is presented.

Materials and Methods

Experiment

Experimental data were obtained in the frame of the MATROSHKA-R space experiment
(Shurshakov et a|., 2008) led by the Russian Federation Institute of Biomedical Problems.
MATROSHKA-R is a spherical tissue equivalent phantom with a diameter of 35 cm and an inner
air cavity with a diameter of 10 cm. H is made of the tissue equivalent prepolymer Diafor-TDI.
Detectors can be placed on the phantom outer surface into 32 pockets of a tissue equivalent
phantom jacket or inside the phantom into 4 thick equatorial and 16 thin containers. A schematic
view of the locations of all pockets and containers is shown in Fig. 1. The measured olose
distributions on the surface and inside the phantom have been published elsewhere
(Shurshakov et a|., 2008, Jadrnickova et a|., 2010; Ambrozova et a|., 2011). Simulated data
were compared with absorbed dose measurements in 8 pockets on the surface of the phantom
(no. 2, 8, 10, 16, 18, 24, 26, 32) exposed in the Russian Service Zvezda Module from
December 21, 2005 to September 20, 2006.

A combination of thermoluminescent detectors (TLDs) and plastic nuclear track detectors
(PNTDs) was used to estimate the absorbed dose in water, the dose equivalent, linear energy
transfer (LET) spectra, and the quality factor. TLDs measure mostly the |ow-LET component of
ionizing radiation (photons and high energy protons), while PNTDs measure only the high-LET
component (protons up to 15 MeV, heavy ions of all energies and the products of neutron

"
"5","nuclear interactions). Taking advantage of the differential response functions of the two
detectors, the total dose can be determined by combining data measured by TLDs anol PNDTs.
Based on the LET spectra from charged particles registered by PNTDs and on the response
function of TLDs to LET, the dose corresponding to high-LET particles was subtracted from the
TLDs signal. The total absorbed dose was then obtained as a sum of the Iow-LET dose from the
TLDs and the high-LET olose measured with PNTDs. The details of the dose derivation
procedure have been given elsewhere (Doke et al., 1995).

Simulations

The radiation field inside the ISS was calculated using the Particle anol Heavy-Ion Transport
code System PHITS (Niita et al., 2010). The PHITS code was designed to simulate the
collisions and transport of heavy ions and other particles in complicated geometries and to
compute fluxes, energy-deposition distributions, and other observables, such as track length or
production yields. It can deal with transport of all kinds of particles over a wide energy range.
For high energy neutrons and other particles the PHITS code uses model JAM (Jet AA
Microscopic Transport Model) (Nara et al., 1999) and JQMD (Jaeri Quantum Molecular
Dynamics based on the quantum molecular dynamics model QMD) (Niita et a|., 2001) to
simulate particle induced reactions up to 200 GeV and nucleus-nucleus collisions up to
100 GeV/u, respectively. Only the ionizing process is considered for low energy charged
particles, nuclei with energies up to 10 MeV/u and for protons and other hadrons up to 1 MeV.
Transport of neutrons below 20 MeV is performed with the event generator mode (Iwamoto et
al., 2007; Niita et al., 2010) using evaluated nuclear data such as ENDF/B-VI (McLane et al.,
1997) and JENDL-3.3 (Shibata et al. 2002; Watanabe et al., 2004).

The MATROSHKA-R experiment was simulated using the PHITS code version 2.08 on a 64-bit
Linux-based cluster equipped with Intel E5345 CPUs at 2.33 GHz at the National
Supercomputer Centre in Linkoping, Sweden (http://www.shpc.net/). The geometry of the
Zvezda Module of the ISS was approximated by an aluminum cylinder with an inner diameter of
400 cm and a length of 400 cm (the geometry of the ISS module was similar as published by
Sihver et al., 2009). The total wa|| mass thickness of the ISS Zvezda Module was estimated to
be between 3 g/cm2 and 5 g/cm2, therefore the simulations were performed for 3 g/cm2 and
5 g/cm2 shielding thickness. The MATROSHKA-R phantom was simulated as the real phantom
(a sphere of a diameter of 35 cm with an air cavity of a diameter of 10 cm) composed of the
same tissue equivalent material. An air cavity of a diameter of 10 cm was inside the sphere and
a tissue equivalent working jacket with 32 pockets was situated on the surface of the phantom.
Detectors inside the pockets were simulated by 5 mm thin layers and the dose absorbed therein
was scored. The shortest distance of the phantom from the ISS wall was 37.5 cm. The whole
geometry is shown in Fig. 2.

In our simulation, the spectra of GCRs obtained from CREME96 (Cosmic Ray Effects on Micro
Electronics 1996) (Tylka et al., 1997; Gustafsson et al., 2009) were used as the external
isotropic radiation environment. The TP spectra were computed using the AP8 model (Fung et
a|., 1996) for the solar minimum condition. The radiation transport in the spacecraft and the

"
"6","phantom was simulated using the PHITS code. The spectra of GCRs anol TPs were calculated
for an altitude of 345 km and an inclination of 51.6 (flight conditions of the ISS in 2006).
Particles from protons up to Nickel with energies ranging from 1 MeV/u to 100 GeV/u were
included in the GCR spectra. No trapped electrons were included in the simulations since they
are expected to be absorbed in the walls of the ISS due to their low energies. Contributions from
solar particle events (there were no significant solar particle events during 2006) were also
neglected. Simulations were performed separately for TPs anol GCRs, and then added to get
the simulated total absorbed dose in the detectors.

To estimate the uncertainties of the calculations and to study how different input parameters
affect absorbed dose in the phantom, a simplified geometry was created as shown in Fig. 3. The
simplified geometry was adopted in order to reduce the required CPU time, since using the
original geometry the calculation of the absorbed dose with a relative standard uncertainty
below 20 % lasted about 30,000 CPU hours. In the simplified geometry, the same phantom
model was used as in the simulations performed with the original more detailed geometry: a
tissue equivalent sphere with an inner air cavity and a jacket, however pockets and detectors
inside the pockets were not considered. Two major changes mark the transition from the original
to the simplified geometry: 1) The ISS cylinder was replaced by spherical aluminum shielding
with an inner radius of 25 cm (the space between the shielding and the phantom was filled by
air). 2) The absorbed dose was scored for the whole tissue equivalent part of the phantom
excluding the centre air cavity and the jacket (see Fig. 3), in the contrary of the previous
calculation, which were only performed for the pockets region on the phantom surface. For the
simplified geometry was used the same isotropic source of GCR obtained from CREME96 and
TP spectra calculated using AP8 as was used for the original more detailed geometry described
above.

Using the simplified simulation geometry, we estimated the influence of variations in altitude and
wall mass thickness of the ISS on the calculated absorbed dose. The calculation was performed
for altitudes ranging from 300 to 400 km (with a constant wa|| mass thickness of the ISS of
4 g/cm2 taken as the best approximation of the ISS shielding) and for wall mass thicknesses
ranging from 1 g/cm2to 15 g/cm2 (at a constant altitude of 345 km).

According to the recommendation stated in the publication “Evaluation of measurement data -
Guide to the expression of uncertainty in measurement” (JCGM:100, 2008), an estimation of
uncertainties of the simulated absorbed dose in the spherical phantom placed aboard the ISS
was performed. Three parameters were considered in the assessment of the overall uncertainty
of the simulated absorbed dose aboard the ISS: (1) the fluctuation of altitude of the ISS, (2) the
variation of shielding mass thickness of the ISS, and (3) the random character of simulations
using the Monte Carlo code. Neither the altitude of the ISS nor its real wa|| mass thickness are
always known precisely (for example, the altitude of the ISS can deviate up to about 10 km from
the average value during a period of several months). To estimate the total uncertainties of the
simulation absorbed dose, we assumed variation of ISS altitude from 335 km to 355 km
(345i10km) and the wall mass thickness from 3 to 5 g/cm2 (4i1 g/cm2). Using simplified
geometry we calculated absorbed dose in phantom for 335 and 355 km, D335km anol D355km, with
aluminum wa|| mass thickness 4 g/cm2. From these results we estimated the standard

"
"7","uncertainty in absorbed dose uA as (D355km-D335km)/2. The same procedure was done for dose
uncertainty uB arising from uncertainty of wall mass thickness of the ISS. The absorbed dose for
shielding 3 and 5 g/cm2, D3g/Cm2 anoI D5g/Cm2, with constant altitude 345 km was calculated and
from these values the standard uncertainty of absorbed dose us was calculated, uB=(D3g/Cm2-
D5g/Cm2)/2. The statistical uncertainty of calculation of absorbed dose was assumed to be 15 %,
based on the results of our simulation, in which the statistical uncertainty of the simulated
absorbed oloses uC was approximately 15 %. The total uncertainty u, of absorbed dose was
calculated as a combination of these three independent uncertainties according to the following
equaﬁon

111 = 1:11; + 1.1;. + “E“
Results and discussion
A comparison of the absorbed oloses measured at the ISS in 2006 to the simulated data in 8
pockets on the surface of the MATROSHKA-R phantom is presented in Fig. 4. The relative
combined standard uncertainty for the experimental data is about 20 °/o. Only statistical
uncertainties related to the number of simulated particles are shown for the simulated results.
Fig. 4 shows that for pockets number 16, 18 and 24, which were facing the wall of the ISS, there
is a better agreement between experimental and simulated results for a shielding mass
thickness of 3 g/cm2 as opposed to 5 g/cm2. On the other hand, the simulated absorbed doses
in pockets 2, 8, 10, 26 and 32 (these pockets were facing the inside of the ISS) are closer to
experimental results when using a shielding mass thickness of 5 g/cm2. This indicates that some
additional material inside the ISS should be added to the simulation geometry, possibly racks
with a total mass thickness of approximately 2 g/cm2. Furthermore, the experimental
measurements showed that the absorbed dose can differ up to 30 % depending on the location
of the detectors inside the ISS compartment (Jadrnickova et a|., 2009; Ambrozova et a|., 2011)
and its surrounding material.
The best overall agreement between averaged simulated absorbed doses and those measured
by detectors on the phantom surface is achieved when using a mass thickness of about
4g/cm2. The measured average absorbed dose was 172 uGy/d and the simulated average
absorbed doses were 196 uGy/d and 153 uGy/d for 3 g/cm2 and 5 g/cm2 of aluminum shielding,
respectively.
The contribution from TPs to the total calculated absorbed dose on the surface of the phantom
is about 75 % when assuming a total wa|| mass thickness of 5 g/cm2 and about 80 % when
assuming 3 g/cm2. When considering the absorbed dose in the whole phantom, the contribution
of TPs decreases with increasing wa|| mass thickness, as can be seen in Fig. 5. This is in
agreement with our previously presented results (Mrazova et a|., 2010), which show that for a
shielding mass thickness of 12.5 g/cm2 the contribution of GCRs anoI TPs to the total absorbed

"
"8","dose is roughly the same. The decrease of the dose contribution from the TPs is also seen in
the experimental data obtained from Liu|in active silicon detector measurements (Semkova et
a|., 2010), which demonstrate that the absorbed dose from TPs constitutes 46 % and 32 % of
the total absorbed dose at a phantom depth of 40 and 165mm, respectively. The Liu|in
measurements were performed from June 28, 2007 to April 08, 2008, when the MATROSHKA-
R phantom was located in the Piers-1 Module at an altitude of 317-369 km, therefore, these
values can not be directly compared with our simulations.

The dependence of the absorbed dose on the ISS aluminum shielding mass thickness is shown
in Fig. 5. The total absorbed dose in water in the whole phantom body decreases with
increasing shielding mass thickness (the absorbed dose is 2 times lower for an aluminum
shielding of 15 g/cm2 than for 1 g/cm2). When considering the GCRs anoI TPs separately, one
can notice that the absorbed dose decreases with increasing shielding mass thickness for the
TPs, while it slightly increases for the GCRs. A reduction of shielding thickness from 15 g/cm2 to
1 g/cm2 results in a 270 % increase of the absorbed dose for TPs, while for GCRs it results in a
25 % decrease. One should keep in mind that these results are for an altitude of 345 km and
that at other altitudes the dependence may be different, depending on the fluence of the TPs
anoI GCRs.

Using the simplified geometry for the simulation (Fig. 3), we estimated how variations in the
altitude and wall mass thickness of the ISS influence the calculated absorbed dose in the
phantom. Fig. 6 shows the altitude dependence of the absorbed dose in water in the whole
phantom region surrounded by a spherical aluminum shielding of 4g/cm2. In Fig. 6, the
simulated total dose rates as well as the individual contributions of GCRs anoI TPs are
presented. While the absorbed dose from GCRs remains nearly constant, the dose from TPs
increases with altitude. The absorbed dose at an altitude of 400 km is more than 4 times of the
dose at an altitude of 300 km. A change of i 10 km in altitude can cause a difference of about
i 15% in absorbed dose. The effect of altitude on the total absorbed dose decreases with
increasing shielding thickness. For an aluminum mass thickness of 12.5 g/cm2(Fig. 7), a 10 km
change in altitude alters the absorbed dose by about 11 % (Mrazova et a|., 2010). In case of
GCRs, changes in the altitude of the ISS have only a minor effect on the dose; for example, a
change of 50 km results in roughly a i 4 % change of the absorbed dose. On the other hand,
the absorbed dose from TPs heavily depends on altitude. An increase of about 50 km in the
altitude increases the simulated absorbed dose by 170 %.

The uncertainties of the simulated absorbed dose aboard the ISS were based on the degree of
influence of the described parameters on the absorbed dose: (1) The fluctuation of the ISS
altitude (i 10 km), which cause uncertainty in dose calculation 30 %; (2) the uncertainty of
determination of wall mass thickness (i1 g/cm2), which cause uncertainty in absorbed dose
14% and (3) 30% of the statistical uncertainty of dose simulations. All three estimated
uncertainties of absorbed dose are reported as expanded relative uncertainties, obtained by
multiplying the relative standard uncertainty with the coverage factor, k= 2 (confidence level
95%). The total relative expanded uncertainty was calculated as described in the end of the
section Materials and Method and it is 44 % at a 95 % confidence level. The major contributors

"
"9","to the total uncertainty are the random character of the calculations and the uncertainty of the
aHHude.

Furthermore, even other parameters might not be negligible in the calculations of absorbed
doses and their uncertainties. The influence of the ISS shielding material and the trapped proton
spectra from different models, for example the SAMPEX/PET model implemented in the
SPENVIS (SPace ENVironment Information System) (Heynderickx et al., 2003) should be
investigated in the future.

Conclusion

This paper presents a comparison of simulated and measured absorbed oloses with
thermoluminescent and plastic nuclear track detectors placed on the surface of the spherical
tissue equivalent phantom MATROSHKA-R, which was exposed aboard the ISS in the Service
Zvezda Module from December 2005 to September 2006. The simulated absorbed doses in the
8 pocket regions of the phantom are in best overall agreement with the measurements
assuming 4 g/cm2 of aluminum as the total shielding. The influence of uncertainties of the ISS
shielding mass thickness and the ISS orbit altitude on the calculated absorbed dose was also
investigated. It was found that a difference in altitude of i 10 km can cause i 15 % difference in
the absorbed dose in the phantom. A difference i tg/cm2 in the wall mass thickness of the
aluminum shielding results in a i7°/o difference in the simulated absorbed dose. The total
relative uncertainty of the calculated absorbed dose in the phantom is 44% at a 95%
confidence level. In the future, the effect of simplification of the geometry on the calculated
results will be tested in an effort to reduce the CPU time needed for the simulations. The
calculation with the current more complicated geometry requires approximately 30,000 CPU
hours to reach a statistical uncertainty of 15 % in the calculated absorbed dose.

"12","Figure 1: The locations of all 32 pockets and 20 containers of the MATROSHKA-R phantom.
Gray filled circles represent the containers, non-filled circles the pockets. The left hemisphere is
oriented towards the inside of the ISS, the right hemisphere towards the wall of the ISS.

Figure 2: Top and front view of the simulation geometry with the MATROSHKA-R phantom
inside the ISS. The whole geometry is located inside a spherical cosmic radiation source.

Figure 3: Scheme of the simplified geometry. The MATROSHKA-R spherical phantom with an
inner air cavity covered by a jacket located inside spherical aluminum shielding. This geometry
was used to estimate the simulation uncertainties.

Figure 4: Comparison of calculated and measured absorbed doses in water for 8
MATROSHKA-R pockets on the surface of the phantom. Only statistical uncertainties are
considered for the calculated data. The gray-shaded area highlights pockets oriented toward the
wall of the ISS.

Figure 5: Dependence of absorbed dose in the whole phantom on aluminum ISS wall mass
thickness for constant altitude 345 km. The data are connected only to guide the eye. The
relative statistical uncertainties are maximum 4 %.

Figure 6: The calculated absorbed dose in the whole phantom as a function of ISS altitude for a
shielding thickness of 4 g/cm2. The solid lines are only to guide the eyes. The relative statistical
uncertainties for the calculated results are maximum 3 %.

Figure 7: The calculated absorbed dose in the whole phantom as a function of ISS altitude for a
shielding thickness of 12.5 g/cmz. The solid lines are only to guide the eyes. The relative
statistical uncertainties for the calculated results are maximum 2 %.
