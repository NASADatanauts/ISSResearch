In this study, a new idea for developing a space scale for measuring mass in a microgravity environment was proposed by
using the inertial force properties of an object to measure its mass. The space scale detected the momentum Change of
the specimen and reference masses by using a load—cell sensor as the force transducer based on Newton’s laws of motion.
In addition, the space scale calculated the specimen mass by comparing the inertial forces of the specimen and reference
masses in the same acceleration field. By using this concept, a space scale with a capacity of 3 kg based on the law of
momentum conservation was implemented and demonstrated under microgravity conditions onboard International Space
Station (188) with an accuracy of :1 g. By the performance analysis on the space scale, it was verified that an instrument
with a compact size could be implemented and be quickly measured with a reasonable accuracy under microgravity
conditions.
