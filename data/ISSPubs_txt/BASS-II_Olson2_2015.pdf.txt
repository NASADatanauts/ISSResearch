For the ﬁrst time an ISS, BASS-II utilized MSG working volume dilution with gaseous
nitrogen (N2). We developed a perfectly stirred reactor model to determine the N2 ﬂow time
and ﬂow rate to obtain the desired reduced oxygen concentration in the working volume for
each test. We calibrated the model with CSA-CP oxygen readings offset using the Mass
Constituents Analyzer reading of the ISS ambient atmosphere data for that day. This
worked out extremely well for operations, and added a new Vital variable, ambient oxygen
level, to our test matrices. The main variables tested in BASS-II were ambient oxygen
concentration, ventilation ﬂow velocity, and fuel type, thickness, and geometry.

BASS-II also utilized the on-board CSA-CP for oxygen and carbon monoxide readings,
and the CDM for carbon dioxide readings before and after each test. Readings from these
sensors allow us to evaluate the completeness of the combustion. The oxygen and carbon
dioxide readings before and after each test were analyzed and compared very well to
stoichiometric ratios for a one step gas-phase reaction. The CO versus C02 followed a linear
trend for some datasets, but not for all the different geometries of fuel and ﬂow tested. We
calculated the heat release rates during each test from the oxygen consumption and burn
times, using the constant 13.1 kJ of heat released per gram of oxygen consumed. The results
showed that the majority of the tests had heat release rates well below 100 Watts. Lastly,
the global equivalence ratio for the tests is estimated to be fuel rich: 1.3 on average using
mass loss and oxygen consumption data.

The black anodized 7.6 cm X 7.6 cm X 17 cm working volume aboard the International Space Station (188) ,
rectangular ﬂow duct with rounded corners With the Suppression of Solids — II (BASS-II) experiment
was originally built to perform gas jet hardware installed. The working volume of the MSG was diluted
diffusion ﬂame studies [9], and was adapted usmg [SS mtrogen gas. The CSA-CP (02 and C0) and CDM (C02)
to accommodate solid samples for the B ASS sensors were used to obtain before and after burn gas
experiments. concentrations.
The ﬂow was blown through the duct using a small variable speed fan. In addition, up to two additional ﬂow
restrictors could be used at the fan inlet to increase the pressure drop and thus reduce the ﬂow through the duct to
the desired value for the test point. With no restrictors, the maximum ﬂow velocity was ~55 cm/s, and with two
restrictors this was reduced to ~35 cm/s. The ﬂow then passed through a honeycomb ﬂow straightener and an inlet
screen to reduce swirl. An omnidirectional spherical air velocity transducer (TSITM8 # 8475) was positioned
between the honeycomb and the screen, and was used to measure the steady—state ﬂow through the duct. The air
velocity transducer probe had a response time of approximately one minute.

OrielTM8 #71768 thermopile detector with a CaFl windows (spectral range of 0.13 to 11 microns) in the downstream
top back corner of the duct. The test section of the duct had two orthogonal windows; the top one was replaced for
BASS to provide a mounting rail system for the solid samples. The top window was used by a NikonTM8 D300 12.3
megapixel digital color still camera with a 60 mm lens that provided 4320 X 2968 pixel images. The duct eXit
contained a perforated copper plate followed by a brass screen to provide heat rejection and a cold surface for soot
deposition. The ﬂow turned ninety degrees to eXit the duct, which facilitated mixing of the hot combustion gases
with the cool ambient air.
The front window opened to provide access to the test section for sample and igniter change out. The front window
also had interlocks for the igniter and nitrogen ﬂow in the lower downstream corner. A Panasonic color Video
camera WV-CP654 (760 X 480 pixel array) with a turning mirror looked in the front window. The Video camera had
a built-in digital overlay that displayed the nitrogen ﬂow rate (cm3/min), fan voltage (10XV), air velocity transducer
reading (cm/s), and the radiometer signal. The fan voltage was calibrated with the air velocity transducer at the end
of every operations day. The radiometer signal was not calibrated, but provided a measure of the ﬂame dynamics
and steadiness. The external control box had controls for the fan voltage, nitrogen ﬂow rate, enable switches for the
igniter and nitrogen ﬂow, and a radiometer gain level setting.
A number of sample geometries were used for BASS-II: Cast PMMA (polymethylmethacrylate) samples were
shaped as rods of various diameters (6.35 to 12.7 mm), thin to thick slabs (0.125 to 5 mm), or a section of a 4 cm
diameter sphere. In addition, ﬂat cotton-ﬂberglass fabric samples were also burned. These samples could generally
be mounted so that they could be burned in either the opposed or concurrent ﬂow direction. The ﬂat samples were 1
cm or 2 cm wide. The samples were manually ignited with a KanthalTM8 A-1 29 gauge h0t-wire igniter with a
nominal hot wire resistance of 0.8 to 1 ohms, powered by 3.5-3.8 amps when the astronaut manually pulled the
deployment lever to move the igniter into position. Samples were burned within the duct and the combustion
products exited the duct and mixed with the gas in the work volume. Example ﬂame images are shown in Figure 2.
Many samples are still on orbit, but 34
samples were returned and evaluated for
mass loss.

"4","0n orbit, so we also used the Major Constituents Analyzer (MCA) [6-7] data to determine the oxygen sensor offset
on a daily basis. The resolution of the oxygen sensor in the CSA-CP was 0.1% 02. Oxygen concentrations in the
MSG working volume were varied during the testing from ambient 188 oxygen levels (~ 21% 02) down to ~ 14%
02 for very near-limit ﬂames. The CO sensor in the CSA-CP is zero calibrated every 60 days, with a range of 0-
1000 ppm and a resolution of 1 ppm. The C02 sensor was within its calibration window, and had a range of 0-5%
and a resolution of 0.1% by volume of C02. The sensor data provided initial and ﬁnal conditions for repeated tests
in a sealed working volume, and allowed us to determine when the working volume needed to be purged. The 02
decreased during each burn and the CO and C02 increased accordingly.

Many of the BASS-II tests also required a diluted atmosphere, which typically took one to three hours to achieve
by dilution of the MSG working volume using 188 nitrogen (from the hose connecting BASS-II duct to back wall of
MSG in Figure 1). The nitrogen was regulated with a small (< 0.5 liters per minute (LPM)) MKSTM8 179A mass
ﬂow meter and entered the ﬂow duct through a small nozzle just downstream of the fan. The fan in the ﬂow duct
was turned to maximum (>100 LPM) during the nitrogen ﬂow to mix and blow the gas into the working volume and
circulate it continuously throughout the hours-long dilution.

II. Validation of MSG Dilution - Continuously Stirred Tank Reactor (CSTR) Model

T0 utilize the capabilities of MSG to reduce the oxygen in the working volume in a controlled manner, we
developed a dilution model based on a Continuously Stirred Tank Reactor (CSTR) model. In this model, the mixing
in the working volume (Via the BASS-II duct fan) is assumed to be ‘instantaneous’, so that the outﬂow ‘1eak’
concentration from the MSG work volume to the ISS cabin is the perfectly mixed instantaneous concentration. This
perfect mixing approximation is valid as long as the residence time (V/r) is 5-10 times as long as the mixing time,
which is easily the case for the 100 LPM ﬂow rate during dilution (250 liters/ 100 LPM ~ 2.5 min mixing time). For
the MSG volume and N2 ﬂow rates, the working volume residence time is V/r=500+ minutes, and the mixing time is
certainly shorter than 50 minutes, so the assumption is valid. The model assumes the work volume is at constant
pressure and temperature, and constant volume. Thus the leak rate out of the work volume is equal to the rate of N2
supplied (r).

The model is based on a mole balance on 02 as follows:

The control volume is the working volume, with an input of nitrogen and a leak rate of well-mixed gas.

Boundary and conditions:

Cm = 0 (pure N2),

Cout = C(t) (CSTR property),

C(O) = C0

"9","V. Conclusions

As part of the BASS-II experiment, we conducted a number of tests with different geometries, ﬂow velocities,
and initial oxygen concentrations. The last variable was enabled by the use of gaseous nitrogen to dilute the
working volume. To adequately characterize this dilution, we developed a CSTR model and veriﬁed it against
sensor readings.

Sensor data from the tests showed that the oxygen was burning nearly stoichiometrically to C02, and that CO
levels appear to be a function of geometry and, in some cases, the ﬂow velocity/geometry combination. The
CO/C02 ratios for these ﬁres are an order of magnitude higher than for efﬁcient ﬂue gases, indicating that these
ﬂames are not efﬁcient. The heat release was estimated for the tests using oxygen consumption calorimetry. This
showed that most of the tests released well below 100 Watts. In the one long test that released close to 100W, we
did sustain some damage to the downstream corner of the front window, due to a leak that directed the heat from this
energetic ﬂame to that location during the prolonged burn. Using the mass loss data and oxygen consumption data,
the global equivalence ratio for the tests is estimated to be 1.3 on average, which indicates the ﬂames were burning
fuel rich under the low velocity forced ﬂow conditions.

VI. Acknowledgments

This work was funded by the 188 Research Project Ofﬁce. We want to acknowledge the invaluable assistance of
all the astronauts who ran BASS and BASS-II. This work couldn’t have been done without the intense efforts of the
BASS operations team (J ay Owens, Chuck Bunnell, Tibor Lorik, and Carol Reynolds). We also want to
acknowledge the ground support teams at GRC, J SC, and MSFC that supported the BASS-II operations.
