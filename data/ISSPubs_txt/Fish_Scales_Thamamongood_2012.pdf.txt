only around the trimmed/perforated area. In contrast, no scale resorption or regeneration was detected in
sham transplantations. Our ﬁnding suggests that loss of correct cell—to—cell contact between the scale—pocket lin—
ing cells and the scale cortex cells is the key to switch on the onset of scale resorption and regeneration. Overall,
the present study shows that goldﬁsh scale regeneration shares similarities in gene expression with intramem—
branous bone regeneration. Improved understanding of goldﬁsh scale regeneration will help elucidate the process
of intramembranous bone regeneration and make goldﬁsh scale a possible new tool to study bone regeneration.
