Abstract. Fnaming experiments in erder te understand the eytilutitin 0f the fﬂam structure blown in
different directions and Ieyels ef grayity have been carried eat. The key elements ef the experiment
are the feam generator bedy (heneeferth PG) and the eentreiled biewing apparatus. The PG was a
pﬂlymer foam inﬁltrated with a suspension (distilled water, pure tenside [SDS, 0.05m%} and SiOg
nanepanieles (2m%)} Feams were blown eat at 1.51r 2, 4, 6, 10 and at 15g levels in three different
directions {0, 90 and 130°, measured to the directiea ef the gravity yeeter]. The elevated gravity
eenditien was implemented in a hyper-g eentrifuge {ZARM Bremen]. Results shew that foams eat:

lntradueﬁen
Feam is a twe-phase material, where the seabed, gaseous phase can be found in a high yeiume
fraetien, dispersed and separated by the set! walls. These cell walls can be either liquid at selitL

under mieruig using a pereus frit te mix gas and a feamable selutien in a pressurized cell [2].

In ear espeiimental werk, we investigated the effect at increased gravity en feam fennatiea and

The werk had teehnelegiea] aspects as well - eheeking the ﬁmetienality ef the FGs under sueh

2. During foaming, gas bubble mevement is more difﬁcult in the gravity directien, where

elegged puree ere duminent. This is. why the foamebility ef the system will be different in 0

Gravity-driven drahtege can influence feemability and the eel! strueture as well. At 130”,

iystem:

- Tha fnamability decreased with increasing g-leval in all measured directions. This is mainly
due to th: diﬁmnt gravity inﬂuencad states of tha FGS prior [0 fbaming Increased
sedimentatinn tendency of nannparticle aggregatinns within the suspansinn can ﬂbstmct gas
routes reducing fnamability. Fluctuating pressure curves together with ﬂow rate and foam

- Stability of [hﬂ fnams did nut depend nu g-lavel, Except far 90“ foaming.
