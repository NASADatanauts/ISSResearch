Healthy immune function depends on precise regulation of lymphocyte activation. During
the NASA Apollo and Shuttle eras, multiple spaceﬂight studies showed depressed lymphocyte
activity under microgravity (pg) conditions. Scientists 0n the ground use two models of simulated
a g (sag), a) the rotating wall vessel (RWV) and b) the random positioning machine (RPM), to study
the effects of altered gravity on cell function before advancing research to the true a g when
spaceﬂight opportunities become available on International Space Station (188). The obj ective of
this study is to compare the effects of true pg and sag 0n the expression of key early T-eell
activation genes in mouse splenocytes from spaceﬂight and ground animals. For the ﬁrst time, we
compared all three conditions of microgravity spaceﬂight, RPM and RWV during immune gene
activation of 112, Il2r0c, Ifny, and T agap; moreover, we conﬁrm two new early T-cell activation genes,
Iigp] and Slamf] . Gene expression for all samples was analyzed using quantitative real-time PCR
(qRT-PCR). Our results demonstrate signiﬁcantly increased gene expression in activated ground
samples with suppression of mouse immune function in spaceﬂight, RPM and RWV samples.
These ﬁndings indicate that s a g models provide an excellent test bed for scientists to develop
baseline studies and augment true a g in spaceﬂight experiments. Ultimately, s a g and spaceﬂight
studies in lymphocytes may provide insight into novel regulatory pathways, beneﬁting both future
astronauts and those here on earth suffering from immune disorders.

The recent launch of the Mars Curiosity rover has renewed international interest in space
exploration, With erewed missions to asteroids, M0011 and Mars planned in the future. However, the
impact of long-term spaceﬂight 011 human health is a considerable concern. One maj or challenge to
crews on future expeditions is extended exposure to environments of microgravity (pg) (13, 17, 35,
36). Past studies have shown adverse effects of a g on several physiological systems, including a
notable reduction of the adaptive immune response (35). To mitigate immune dysfunction in crews
on future missions to Mars and beyond, it is critical to understand the mechanism of how a g impairs
normal immune response; a collateral beneﬁt is that spaceﬂight gives us a unique opportunity to
study regulatory mechanisms of depressed immune response. As we discover novel regulatory
checkpoints in early activation, some may prove useful drug targets for inﬂammatory diseases, such
as rheumatoid arthritis, Crohn’s disease, and celiac disease (16, 29, 39, 43). Because logistics and
cost are major constraints to spaceﬂight studies of lymphocytes, it is essential to use alternate
models that simulate a g to test hypotheses, design experimental parameters, and augment
spaceﬂight experiments.

Immunosuppression during spaceﬂight was ﬁrst observed in returning astronauts 0f the
Apollo and Skylab missions (26). Over half of the Apollo astronauts experienced respiratory,
gastrointestinal, urinary tract, or skin infections upon return to earth (19). Studies of returned Soyuz
crew members also showed depressed lymphocyte activation compared to levels pre-spaceﬂight
(27). Immunosuppression during spaceﬂight may increase the risk of opportunistic infections.
Shuttle astronauts 011 short duration (11 day) spaceﬂight had signiﬁcant increases in early Viral gene
transcription of the Epstein-Barr Virus (EBV) compared to healthy controls, While astronauts
onboard the 188 for long-duration (180 day) spaceﬂight had latent and lytie EBV gene expression
that resembled activation patterns seen during infectious mononucleosis (13).

"5","While some in vivo changes in astronaut lymphocyte function could be due to neuro-
endocrine stress factors, in in vitro studies of space ﬂown lymphocytes,0ur laboratory and others
have demonstrated that immunosuppression occurs independent of systemic factors in u g (11, 12,
35). Studies carried out on several Spacelab ﬂights showed a dramatic loss of human T-eell
activation in ﬂown peripheral blood leukocytes compared to ground controls. Spacelab 1
experiments saw a 97% depression in activation by concanavalin A (ConA) and subsequent
spaceﬂights have demonstrated similar ﬁndings (12, 13). In particular, IL-Z, IL-ZRa, IFNy, and
T NF 0c are signiﬁcantly depressed in human T-cells under ug conditions (4, 7, 11). Experiments
onboard the ISS comparing gene expression in activated ug and 1 g onboard controls conclusively
proved that ug causes immunosuppression in T-cells (7, 34).

Conducting experiments in an environment of true u g requires a roundtrip ticket into space,
a feat that is both expensive and challenging. Simulated ug (sug) models allow scientists to gather
preliminary data Without the cost and logistical challenges of spaceﬂight. RWVs and three-
dimensional clinostats, also called RPMs, are two systems commonly used to simulate pg 011 the
ground. The RPM was developed by Hoson at Osaka City University (21, 22), and consists of two
frames that rotate independently about distinct orthogonal axes While controlled by randomized
software. Cells are placed 011 the inner frame and rotated in random directions and speeds. The
gravity vector is forced into constant motion and can approach a residual force as low as 10'5 g (24).
RWVs were developed by the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) J ohnson
Space Center (J SC) Biotechnology Group as a model system for the low-shear, low-turbulence
conditions predicted for cell culture in space (41). Suspended cells are rotated synchronously in the
vessel such that the ﬂuid dynamic effect on them mimics a particle allowed to free-fall in a column
of ﬂuid. The time averaged gravitational vector on individual cells is a residual 10'3 g force that
approximates pg (18, 33).

"
"6","The obj ective 0f the present study was to evaluate the gene expression of several early
signals known to change in spaceﬂight T-eell activation in mice splenocytes With those exposed to
RPM- and RWV-sttg. We chose siX key T-cell activation genes upregulated during activation and
downregulated in pg. Four of the genes, [[2, 112m, Ifny, and T agap are known from our human
studies of early T-cell activation during spaceﬂight (4, 7). We have discovered that two genes, Iigp]
and Slamf] are also early T-eell activation genes.

We measured gene activation and expression in T-eell response using qRT-PCR; our results
show that the patterns of gene regulation are similar for spaceﬂight and sag. Activation of
splenocytes in 1 g caused an up regulation of all siX early immune genes Whereas activation in pg
and s a g produced a signiﬁcant downregulation of activation. Corresponding measurements of
cytokine protein conﬁrm the trend of immunosuppression seen in cytokine mRNA gene induction.
To our knowledge, this is the ﬁrst study to directly compare gene activity between spaceﬂight and
both primary ground models of sag. Our ﬁndings conﬁrm that RWV and RPM simulations provide
excellent models of a g and are an important and useful resource for testing hypotheses before
progressing to the true a g environment of spaceﬂight.

"7","MATERIALS AND METHODS
Mice:

The spaceﬂight animals and ground controls were maintained at NASA’s Kennedy Space
Center Space Life Sciences Lab (KSC-SLSL) or the San Francisco Department of Veterans Affairs
(VA), Veterinary Medical Unit Housing in accordance with the guidelines of the Institutional
Animal Care and Use Committee and recommendations in the Guidefor the care and use of
laboratory animals (National Research Council, 1996). Animal use in this study was approved by
the NASA Ames Research Center/JSC Animal Care Committee or by the VA Animal Studies
Subcommittee. All procedures were performed under license of these committees.

C57BL/6J wild-type female mice of similar age and weight were purchased from J ackson
Laboratory (Bar Harbor, USA). Mice used for the RWV and RPM experiments were housed in the
VA facilities and were used in accordance with the institutional guidelines for animal care. Mice
used for STS-131 spaceﬂight were shipped to the KSC-SLSL from San Francisco VA facility ten
weeks prior to launch to ensure acclimation to environment and minimize stress from transit.
Preﬂight weights were 22.02i0.85 g for spaceﬂight mice and 22.02 i 0.94g for ground control mice.
Post-ﬂight weights were 20.06 i 1.73 g for spaceﬂight and 21.75 i 0.69g for ground. As compared
to ground mice, ﬂight mice lost a small but statistically signiﬁcant amount of weight. This was
likely due to increased energy expenditure from the ﬂight mice holding onto cages during the ﬂight
or ﬂying around the cages (seen in Video from other ﬂights). All mice were of similar age at the
time of experiment.

The Animal Enclosure Modules (AEMs) were provided by NASA Ames Research Center
(Moffett Field, CA) for both spaceﬂight and ground controls in the spaceﬂight experiments. AEMs
are widely used for rodent spaceﬂight housing. They are the standard and ideal habitat for rodent
housing in spaceﬂight because they provide a constant and steady airﬂow that causes feces to ﬂow
into an air ﬁlter (1 , 30). One day prior to launch, mice were handed over to Shuttle integration or to

Spaceﬂight mice (11:8) and ground mice (11:8) were housed in AEMS and given identical
food bar diets and water. The spaceﬂight mice were ﬂown on board the Space Shuttle Discovery for
15 days; synchronous ground control mice held 011 the same sleep/wake cycle and at the same
temperatures. Within 2.5 hours after landing at KSC, ground and spaceﬂight mice were sedated,
euthanized, according to IACUC institutional guidelines for animals and splenoeytes were isolated
and activated for cell culture and isolation.

Simulated Microgravity Conditions

For RWV experiments, 10ml disposable vessels (Figure 121) were used with a Rotary Cell
Culture System (Synthecon Inc, Houston TX). The system was placed in at 370C incubator for
experiments. For RPM experiments, 10ml Nunc Opticells (Thermo Fisher Scientiﬁc, Rochester
NY) were placed 011 a desktop RPM (Dutch Science, Leiden Netherlands) at 370C (Figure 2).

Cell Culture and Activation:

Splenocytes harvested from the spaceﬂight and ground mice were collected within 2.5 hours
at the KSC-SLSL as follows. Spleens were harvested, dissociated, and cells were run through a
70 um cell strainer and treated with 151111 1X Pharm Lyse Buffer (BD Biosciences, San J ose, CA)
for 7min at room temperature. Medium was added and cells were centrifuged at 1300rpm for 10min
and ﬁltered through a 40 um cell strainer. All samples were cultured in RPMI medium
supplemented with 1% (V/V) L—glutamine, antibiotics, glucose-pyruvate, 1.2% (V/V) HEPES buffer,
and 10% (V/V) FBS and maintained at 37°C and 5% CO2. Each mouse represented an independent
biological sample.

Samples from spaceﬂight mice and ground mice were loaded into 12-well plates. Treated
cells (11:4 per gravity condition) were activated with 25 111/1 .5ml Dynabeads® Mouse T-Activator

without bead activation. Cells were pelleted then ﬁxed with 600u1 RNAlater (Ambion, Austin, TX)
after 2.5 hours and stored at -800C until further analysis.

RWV and RPM splenoeytes were harvested from C57BL/6J wild-type female mice (RWV
11:4; RPM 11:5) as described above. RWV samples were loaded into 10ml RWVs and RPM samples
were loaded into 10ml Nunc Opticell culture chambers. Splenoeytes were conditioned to sag in
both RWV and RPM by pre-rotation of 1.5 hours. Samples were activated with 60111/101111
Dynabeads® Mouse T-Activator CD3/CD28 for 2.5 hours and ﬁxed in RNAproteet (QIAGEN,
Valencia, CA). 1 g control samples, in their respective vessels, were activated and placed in a static
position. Non-treated samples were kept under the same conditions as the controls without bead
activation. Cells were pelleted then ﬁxed with 600u1 RNAprotect (QIAGEN, Valencia, CA) after
2.5 hours of activation and stored at -800C until further analysis

To test whether a pre-rotation period is necessary in the T-eell, S“ g samples were incubated
at 37°C and rotated for 0 and 1.5 hours in RWVs prior to activation (Table 1).
RNA isolation and real—time quantitative RT-PCR:

RNA was isolated using the miRNeasy® Mini Kit (QIAGEN, Valencia, CA) according to
the manufacturer’s protocol. After isolation, samples were stored at -80°C until further analysis.
For the RT reaction, RNA (0.3 micrograms) was added to 30ul RT reaction buffer containing 5111M
MgCl2, 10 mM Tris-HCl (pH 8.3), 50 mM KCl, lmM dNTP, 2.5 pM oligo d(T) primer, 2.5U/u1
Murine Leukemia Virus Reverse Transcriptase, and 1 U/ui RNase inhibitor. The reaction was
incubated at 25°C for 10 min, 37°C for 2 hours, inactivated at 85°C for 5 min and held at 4°C.
CDNA (2 p1) from the RT reaction was added to 20 pl qRT-PCR containing 10 p1 2X-SYBR Green
PCR Master Mix (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA) and 12 pmol oligonucleotide primers.
PCRs were carried out in a Bio—Rad CFX96 Touch Real-Time PCR Detection System or a Bio—Rad

950C for 10 min to activate the T aq polymerase, followed by 40 ampliﬁcation cycles, consisting of
denaturation at 950C for 1 min 40 see, annealing at 630C for 1 min 10 sec, and elongation at 720C
for 1 min 40 sec. Fluorescence is used as a readout in qRT-PCR Fluorescence of the qRT-PCR
reaction was measured using Bio-Rad CFX Manager software (Bio-Rad Laboratories, Hercules,
CA) and used to quantify mRNA expression. At the end of the ampliﬁcation period, melting curve
analysis was performed to conﬁrm the speciﬁcity of the amplicon. RNA samples were normalized
to cyclophilin (Cphi) internal standard. Relative fold increase of gene expression was calculated by
using the 2 MO equation, where Ct represents the comparative threshold. Relative gene absolute
abundance calculations were made by using the equation 1/ (2 Ct gene T ' Ct CPHI T) as previously
described (25). The resulting values were then multiplied by 100,000 for better graphical
presentation. All data derived using qRT-PCR was from multiple experiments with four or more
independent biological samples. Data is representative of multiple experiments using mouse
splenocytes: Human T cell activation also had similar immunosuppression in spaceﬂight, RPM and
RWV. Statistical analysis was performed using ANOVA with a post-hoc Tukey test. Primers used
were designed using OLIGO Primer Analysis Software (Molecular Biology Insights, Cascade, CO)
in the Hughes-Fulford laboratory and manufactured by Euroﬁns Genomics (Huntsville, A1). 111
some cases, the sequences for primers were developed directly from Primer Bank (40).
Cytokines

Splenocytes were isolated and activated in STS-131 ﬂown (11:8) and ground control (11:8)
mice as described above. Following 22h of activation, cells were pelleted and supernatants were
collected. Concentrations of 1L2 and IFNy in supernatants were measured with the Mouse Cytokine
20-PleX Panel kit (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) using the Bio-PleXTM 200 System (Bio-Rad, Hercules,

diluted ten-fold to obtain accurate measurements.
ILZRa ELISA

Supernatants were collected as described above. Mouse ILZROL was measured using a
mouse ILZROL ELISA kit (Corning Life Sciences, Corning, NY) according to the manufacturer’s
protocol. The optical density value was measured using a Spectra MRTM (DyneX, Chantilly, VA).
Because ILZROL concentrations were high, supernatants from activated samples were diluted ten-

"
"12","RESULTS:

qRT-PCR was used to compare the expression of siX speciﬁc early T-cell activation markers
between spaceﬂight samples under true a g and under sag in RWV and RPM samples (Figures 3-5).
True a g and s a g caused a blunted T-eell activation response in the mouse splenoeyte gene
expression patterns.
Gene expression in activated murine splenocytes in S T S-1 31 spaceﬂight and ground controls

Splenocytes were puriﬁed from mice that had been ﬂown on the STS-131 mission in Animal
Enclosure Modules (AEMs). Four or more independent biological samples were used in these
experiments. To control for experimental variables, splenocytes were simultaneously puriﬁed from
animals that had been kept in AEMs 0n the ground for the duration of the spaceﬂight. We
selectively performed qRT-PCR on several genes that have been identiﬁed in early T-cell activation
pathways. All splenocyte RNA samples were tested for quantitative expression 0f112, 112m, Ifny,
T agap, Iigp], and Slamf] (Figure 3). Relative decrease of gene induction ranged from 28.15% up to
66.62% of ground activated splenocytes. Expression of the housekeeping genes cyclophilin (Cphi)
was unchanged between spaceﬂight and ground or 1 g and sag samples (data not shown).
Activated samples (a g and ground) showed signiﬁcant increases in expression over na'1've controls
(Figure 3). Expression of all genes except T agap decreased signiﬁcantly in ug-activated cells
stimulated with Dynabeads®.
Gene expression in non-treated, Ig-activated and syg-activated murine splenocytes

To investigate the effects of s a g on early activation genes, we determined whether
expression of immediate early genes was also inhibited in RWV and RPM sag. Expression 0f112,
112m, Ifny, T agap, Iigp], and Slamf] were measured by qRT-PCR (Figures 4 and 5). For cells in
both sag environments, expression of all genes in 1 g-activated samples increased signiﬁcantly

12

"
"13","compared to non-treated control. Immunosuppression was almost complete in the a g models, with
Ifny, T agap, and Iigp] failing to achieve signiﬁcant activation over naive controls in RWV-s a g
(Figure 4); in addition, [[2, 112m, Ifny, and Iigp] were signiﬁcantly suppressed in RPM-sttg (Figure
5). In the RWV, immunosuppression ranged from 74.56% to as high as 95.30% of controls,
showing a signiﬁcant effect of S“ g on immune activation. Suppression in the RPM was also
signiﬁcant, ranging from a 49.88% to 86.20% depression.
Pre-rotation is not required for ,ug to inhibit expression

In some cell types and pathways, a pre-rotation period is required for a downregulation of
gene expression (20). To test the need to acclimate splenocytes to a sag environment in RWV, gene
expression was compared between naive cells, bead activated (BA) 1 g and a g samples that were
either pre-rotated in S“ g prior to activation or left at 1 g for the pre-incubation period, and
subsequently rotated in S“ g after activation (Table 1). A11 genes for 1 g-aetivated samples were
signiﬁcantly upregulated relative to the non-treated controls. All genes were signiﬁcantly
downregulated in both the 0 and 1.5 hour pre-rotated BA s a g relative to the BA 1 g samples, and
there was no signiﬁcant difference in expression between the two S“ g conditions.
Chemokine and cytokine production is suppressed in ,ug

Protein levels were measured for 1L2, ILZROL and IFNy in spaceﬂight and ground samples
to conﬁrm that immunosuppression in mRNA levels reﬂected changes in protein production. Gene
expression of 1L2, IL2ROL and IFNy were measured in cells from ﬂown and ground animals that
were ﬁxed 22 hours following activation with Dynabeads. Synthesis of all three proteins was
signiﬁcantly decreased in ﬂight cell supernatants when compared to ground controls and
corresponded to the changes seen in mRNA levels (Table 2).

"14","DISCUSSION

The immune system evolved under earth’s gravity to defend against potentially harmful
infectious agents. It is well established that spaceﬂight impairs normal immune function, With pg
indicted as a primary culprit (7, 35, 36). Maintaining a balance of pathogen clearance and
avoidance of self—attaek requires strict regulation of activation pathways in the immune system.
Impaired activation can cause dysfunctional immune responses and the inability to clear routine
pathogens, such as in X-linked lymphoproliferative syndrome (XLP), Which is characterized by
extreme sensitivity to the Epstein-Barr Virus (EBV) (15). Uncontrolled activation can lead to
autoimmune disorders such as Sj egren’s syndrome and systemic lupus erythematosus (3 9) and
inﬂammatory diseases (16, 43). Immunosuppression during spaceﬂight has been recognized since
the Apollo missions, and recent studies have highlighted the risk of opportunistic infection in
astronauts, such as the re-emergenee of latent EBV in both short- and long-duration spaceﬂight
(13).

Using the absence of gravity and its resultant immunosuppression also provides new
opportunities to discover novel pathways controlling the immune system. Spaceﬂight experiments
are by deﬁnition the ideal environment for studying cell function in pg. However, due to the
expense and rare launch opportunities of sending studies into space, ground models of simulated u g
are a necessary step in testing hypotheses and collecting preliminary data before advancing studies
to spaceﬂight. The ability to activate lymphocytes in u g has been known for some time. Cogoli-
Greuter and others have previously shown that cell-cell contact and aggregate formation are not
impaired When cells are activated in both true and sag (9, 10, 31). Levels of suppression in all six
genes are more apparent in immediate exposure to sag, as seen in RPM (49.88%-86.20%) and
RWV (74.56%-95.30%) sag. The effects of Hg persisted upon return to normal gravity. Spaceﬂight
animals were not in u g from de-orbit until cell activation (approx. 12 hours) and showed highly

14

"
"15","signiﬁcant suppression (28.15%-66.62%) of immune activation for [[2, 112m, Ifny, Iigp], and
Slamf] .

This is the ﬁrst time that the gene expression of activated mouse splenooytes and naive
splenooytes has been compared side-by-side with these three types of pg. We compared the proﬁles
of siX genes ([12, 112m, Ifny, Iigp] , Slamf] and T agap) with increased expression in early T-oell
activation. [[2, 112m and Ifny were picked because of their well- known and key roles in
lymphocyte activation and because they have been identiﬁed in several past studies as being
downregulated in human T-oells during spaceﬂight (4, 7, 11). T agap was selected due to our
previous ﬁndings from human spaceﬂight experiments (4, 7). We recently discovered that Slamf]
and Iigp] were down-regulated 2.5 hours after activation as shown by microarray analysis of
splenooytes from mice ﬂown on STS-l31 (manuscript in preparation). Conﬁrmation of the down-
regulation of these two genes in a g using qRT-PCR is reported here for the ﬁrst time.

The transcription factor, o-Rel, plays a central role in early immune activation (7) and in the
regulation of several of our siX early activation genes studied here (Figure 6). Iigp] is an interferon-
induoible GTPase in mice that belongs to a family of 47-kDa family of GTPases expressed early in
the activation response and has been identiﬁed only in the mouse (3). Our data shows it is
upregulated as early as 2.5 hours after activation in mouse splenoeytes. Iigp] upregulation is reliant
upon the presence of Ifny, but is also strongly activated by T-oell receptor (TCR)/CD28-mediated
activation (42). This is in agreement with our present study, where we found TCR/CD28 mediated
activation upregulated Iigp] expression in 1 g ground conditions. Further studies in murine T-eells
have indicated that Iigp] may be a potential target of o-Rel (5). This is consistent with the
downregulation of Iigp] seen in all three microgravity conditions we tested, since o-Rel itself
experiences a signiﬁcant reduction in gene expression in activated T-oells in spaceﬂight (7)

T agap is a T-oell activation speciﬁc GTPase-aotivating protein. In humans, T agap
expression is strongest at 1.5 hours and diminishes at later time points (personal observation). In

15

"
"16","spaceﬂight samples from mouse splenocytes, the immunosuppression by microgravity is not seen,
perhaps due to the time delay from de-orbit until activation. Two and a half hours after activation in
the RWV there is signiﬁcant immunosuppression of T agap expression. In the RPM, there is
suppressed activation of TAGAP when compared to 1 g controls.

Slamf] regulation and signaling has been characterized by several past studies and reviews
(6, 8, 15, 23, 28). Slamf] belongs to the signaling lymphocyte-aetivation molecule family that
provides a eo-stimulatory activation signal, and is induced in naive T-eells following activation. It
has been implicated as an activation gene in macrophages and is expressed approximately 3 hours
after IFN'y/TCR eo-stimulation, with maximum expression 6 t0 8 hours after stimulation (8). Here
we show that Slamf] is upregulated as early as 2.5 hours in mice splenocytes. Following TCR
stimulation, engagement of the SLAM receptor results in a costimulatory signal that later helps to
ﬁne-tune TCR signals (6, 8). Our 1 g activation data conﬁrm the upregulation of Slamf] in early
activation, and present novel evidence of its down-regulation across all three models of pg.

Dysregulation 0f SLAM signaling has severe consequences. XLP is characterized by a
mutation in the gene encoding SAP (SLAM-assoeiated protein), which binds to activated SLAM.
Patients with XLP are characterized by dysfunctional response to EBV infection. In normal
lymphocytes, increased levels of SAP following TCR activation leads to decreased IFNy
production. In the absence of SAP, such as in XLP patients, IFNy-producing cells hyperproliferate
and THZ cells develop abnormally (15). EBV is reactivated in astronauts during spaceﬂight, though
the speciﬁc mechanism of reactivation has not yet been identiﬁed (13, 37). It is possible that the
dysregulation of Slamf] expression in a g contributes to the re-emergenee of latent EBV in short-
and long-duration spaceﬂight.

As seen in Figure 6, after binding SLAM, SAP recruits and activates the sre kinase Fyn
(14). The signaling pathway is also thought to include SHIP1, which associates with Fyn, and the
adaptor molecules Dokl and D0k2. Tyrosine phosphorylated D0k2 was found to associate with

16

"
"17","RasGAP. How this association affects downstream signals is unknown, but it is of interest as Ras is
a well-known element of the TCR/CD28-mediated signaling pathway (28). In leprosy patients,
activation of SLAM triggered a signaling cascade that induced activation of the NF-KB complex,
resulting in increased IFNy production (32). SLAM may also signal independently of SAP: studies
in SAP-deﬁeient mice showed that eross-linking SLAM resulted in increased IFNy production and
activation of the Ser/Thr kinase Akt independent of SAP (Figure 6) (23). Collectively, these data
demonstrate the complexity of the SLAM-mediated eo-stimulatory pathway in T-cell activation.
The downstream impact of Slamf] dysregulation in spaceﬂight is an interesting question for further
study, given the risk of opportunistic re-emergenee of EBV in astronauts (13).

Our qRT-PCR data conﬁrms that gene expression of key genes in activated mice
splenocytes placed in the RWV and RPM is very similar to the expression proﬁle of the same genes
analyzed in humans and mice ﬂown 011 188. Although the fold change of gene expression with
activation is higher in spaceﬂight samples than in ground sag, the expression of key genes [[2,
112m, Ifny, Iigp], Slamf] and T agap follow the same trend of immunosuppression in both ground
sag (RWV and RPM) and in spaceﬂight. Suppression of the siX early activation genes is clearly
demonstrated across all three models of Hg”

Protein levels were not detectable at the 2.5 hour time point for both ground and spaceﬂight
activated samples. This is not surprising, since the induced gene expression is at an early time point
and the splenocytes do not have the time required for transcription, translation and accumulation of
detectable levels of protein. We have been able to detect protein synthesis by multiplex methods 22
hours after activation in splenoeytes from spaceﬂight and ground mice; there was strong and
signiﬁcant suppression of the gene product, which correspond well with mRNA data (Table 2).
1L2, IL2ROL, and IFNy protein levels were signiﬁcantly inhibited (42.03%-75.75%) and closely
mirrored the trend and magnitude of inhibition of gene expression at 2.5 hours (39.73%-66.62%).

"18","These data show that the effects of a g persist for some time following return to normal gravity.
Variation in incubation chamber shape could account for the differences in the absolute values of
activation seen across the models, as the shape of the container may affect aspects of T-
eell/Dynabead interaction. However, the importance of these differences are minor in light of the
strong overall trend of signiﬁcant immunosuppression seen in gene induction in all three models of
reduced gravity, and the overall performance the S“ g models was excellent When compared to true
spaceﬂight.
Perspectives and Signiﬁcance

Our results show that simulated models of microgravity induce immunosuppression in
splenocytes similar to that seen in splenocytes from mice exposed to true microgravity in
spaceﬂight. These ﬁndings demonstrate the crucial role of sag models in illuminating novel
mechanisms that regulate T-eell function and in augmenting spaceﬂight studies. Ultimately,
insights into lymphocyte regulatory pathways gained from sag and spaceﬂight studies Will beneﬁt
not only future astronauts, but also those on earth WhO suffer from immune disorders.
