Abstract—The aims and tasks of the space experiment “BTN—Neutron” onboard the Russian segment of the
International Space Station are described. The experiment deals With detection of fast and epithermal neu—
trons, X— rays, and gamma rays. Characteristics and a short description of scientiﬁc instrumentation BTN—Ml
for this experiment are presented, as well as the ﬁrst results of operation of the apparatus onboard the station
during the ﬁrst two years of ﬂight.
