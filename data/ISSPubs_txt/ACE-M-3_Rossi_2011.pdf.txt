m The relation between particle shape and crystal symmetry and HEMAT'TE a
structure remains a fundamental issue in condensed matter science.
The simplest and most symmetric crystal is cubic and its natural
building block is the cube. Simple cubic crystals are quite rare: the
lethally toxic oc-emitter polonium is the only element which forms
a simple cubic (SC) structurel’2 Here we present the ﬁrst observations

hollow silica cubes. There are important reasons to investigate the ' f
uncommon simple cubic structure employing colloids rather than
atoms. SC—crystals of colloidal cubes may ﬁll space, in marked
contrast to the very open atomic SC—patterns. On the other hand
cubic particles can ﬁll space with non—registered planes which lack
shear rigidity, sliding phases, and also constitute a promising exper— SIUCA c

crystal nucleation and growth, directly observed with an optical 5
microscope, is driven by anisotropic depletion forces that cannot be
generated in conventional sphere ﬂuids. This allows additional
