2004. Conducting cell biology experiments in microgravity can be among the most technically challenging events in
a biologist's life. Conﬂicting events of spaceﬂight include waiting to get manifested, delays in manifest schedules,
training astronauts to not shake your cultures and to add reagents slowly, as shaking or quick injection can activate
signaling cascades and give you erroneous results. It is important to select good hardware that is reliable. Possible
conﬂicting environments in ﬂight include g-force and vibration of launch, exposure of cells to microgravity for
extended periods until hardware is turned on, changes in cabin gases and cosmic radiation. One should have an on-
board l-g control centrifuge in order to eliminate environmental differences. Other obstacles include getting your
funding in a timely manner (it is not uncommon for two to three years to pass between notification of grant approval
for funding and actually getting funded). That said, it is important to note that microgravity research is worthwhile
since all terrestrial life evolved in a gravity field and secrets of biological function may only be answered by remov-
ing the constant of gravity. Finally, spaceﬂight experiments are rewarding and worth your effort and patience.
