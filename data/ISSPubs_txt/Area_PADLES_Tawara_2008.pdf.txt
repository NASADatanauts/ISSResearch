' AntioXidant doped CR—39 detectors were loaded onto the STS-95 space shuttle mission (altitude: 574 km; inclination: 28.453;
ﬂight daration: 8.9 days) for measuring the linear energy transfer (LET) distribution above 10 keV/um for space radiation i
dosimetry. It is known that the track formation sensitivity of antioxidant doped CR-39 detectors depends on the dip angle of
the incident particle. We investigated this dip angle dependence for a wide range of LET values and dip angles. The track it
formation sensitivities at lower dip angles were obviously decreased in the LET region below 100 keV/pm. We introduced
minimum-cutoff dip angles in order to correct for such dip-angle dependence. The LET distribution of the STS-95 mission t
’ was obtained from the measurements of etch pits having dip angles larger than the minimum-cutoff dip angles. This new
correction method increased the absorbed dose and dose equivalent above 10 keV/ pm by 54 and 28%, respectively. b
