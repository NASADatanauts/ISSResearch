R3DE: Radiation RISK Radnometer-Dosnmeter
on the International Space Station—Optlcal Radiation
Data Recorded During 18 Months of EXPOSE-E
Exposure to Open Space
Martin Schuster,1 Tsvetan Dachev,2 Peter Richter,1 and Donat—Peter Hader3
Abstract
Radiation Risk Radiometer-Dosirneter E (R3DE) served as a device for measuring ionizing and non-ionizing
radiation as well as cosmic radiation reaching biological samples located on the EXPOSE platform EXPOSE-E. The
duration of the mission was almost 1.5 years (2008—2009). With four channels, R3DE detected the wavelength
ranges of photosynthetically active radiation (PAR, 400—700 nm), UVA (315—400 nm), UVB (280—315 nm), and UVC
(< 280 nm). In addition, the temperature was recorded. Cosmic ionizing radiation was assessed with a 256-channe1
spectrometer dosimeter (see separate report in this issue). The light and UV sensors of the device were calibrated
with spectral measurement data obtained by the Solar Radiation and Climate Experiment (SORCE) satellite as
standard. The data were corrected with respect to the cosine error of the diodes. Measurement frequency was
0.1 Hz. Due to errors in data transmission or temporary termination of EXPOSE power, not all data could be
acquired. Radiation was not constant during the mission. At regular intervals of about 2 months, low or almost no
radiation was encountered. The radiation dose during the mission was 1823.98 M] rn‘2 for PAR, 269.03 M] rn‘2 for
UVA, 45.73 M] rn‘2 for UVB, or 18.28 M] rn‘2 for UVC. Registered sunshine duration during the mission was
about 152 days (about 27% of mission tirne).The surface of EXPOSE was most likely turned away from the Sun for
considerably longer. R3DE played a crucial role on EXPOSE-EuTEF (EuTEF, European Technology Exposure
Facility), because evaluation of the astrobiology experiments depended on reliability of the data collected by the
device. Observed effects in the samples were weighted by radiation doses measured by R3DE. Key Words: ISS—
