Abstract

We report on the onboard apparatus for the J apanese colloid “Kikuchi-Kossel” experiment on the ISS/KIBO. The system was devoted to the
KIBO utilization research theme “Study on the mutual interaction process between colloids”, as proposed by Prof. Sogami and started in 2011,
where the main objective is observation of structure formation process in colloid dispersions under micro—G condition to verify existence of a
long-range attraction force among the colloid particles. Based on the mission requirement, we have implemented a Kikuchi-Kossel
1aser-diffract0meter and void-observation systems, where the former a110ws structural analysis of the colloid crystal structure and the 1atters
allow the structure formation study at a mesoscopic (~10-100 pm) and macroscopic sca1e(~1mm) in colloid dispersions. The system also
includes space-unique subsystems such as a stirring system and cuvettes etc. The paper summarizes system descriptions based on the
Preliminary Design Review (PDR) phase. In December 2014, several colloid themes by other international partners are also planned for the
188. It is expected that CCOF will contribute signiﬁcantly to these colloid research community.
