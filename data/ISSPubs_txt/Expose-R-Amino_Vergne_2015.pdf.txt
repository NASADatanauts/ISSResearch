Abstract: Careful examination of the present metabolism and in vitro selection of various catalytic RNAs
strongly support the RNA world hypothesis as a crucial step of the origins and early life evolution. Small
functional RNAs were exposed from 10 March 2009 to 21 J anuary 2011 to space conditions on board the
International Space Station in the EXPOSE-R mission. The aim of this study was to investigate the
preservation or modiﬁcation properties such as integrity of RNAs after space exposition. The exposition to
the solar radiation has a strong degradation effect on the size distribution of RNA. Moreover, the
comparison between the in-ﬂight samples, exposed to the Sun and not exposed, indicates that the solar
radiation degrades RNA bases.
