Abstract
Bone is a complex dynamic tissue undergoing a continuous remodeling process. Gravity is a physical force playing a role in
the remodeling and contributing to the maintenance of bone integrity. This article reports an investigation on the
alterations of the bone microarchitecture that occurred in wild type (Wt) and pleiotrophin—transgenic (PTN—Tg) mice
exposed to a near-zero gravity on the International Space Station (ISS) during the Mice Drawer System (MDS) mission, to
date, the longest mice permanence (91 days) in space. The transgenic mouse strain over—expressing pleiotrophin (PTN) in
bone was selected because of the PTN positive effects on bone turnover. Wt and PTN-Tg control animals were maintained
on Earth either in a MDS payload or in a standard Vivarium cage. This study revealed a bone loss during spaceflight in the
weight-bearing bones of both strains. For both T9 and Wt a decrease of the trabecular number as well as an increase of the
mean trabecular separation was observed after flight, whereas trabecular thickness did not show any significant change.
Non weight-bearing bones were not affected. The PTN-Tg mice exposed to normal gravity presented a poorer trabecular
organization than Wt mice, but interestingly, the expression of the PTN transgene during the flight resulted in some
protection against microgravity’s negative effects. Moreover, osteocytes of the Wt mice, but not of Tg mice, acquired a
round shape, thus showing for the first time osteocyte space-related morphological alterations in vivo. The analysis of
specific bone formation and resorption marker expression suggested that the microgravity-induced bone loss was due to
both an increased bone resorption and a decreased bone deposition. Apparently, the PTN transgene protection was the
result of a higher osteoblast activity in the flight mice.
