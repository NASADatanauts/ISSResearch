The low—Earth orbit (LEO) radiation environment has been directly observed by the IV and EV Charged particle
directional spectrometers (CPDS) aboard the International Space Station (ISS). The EV instrument is mounted
on the SO truss 0f the ISS, and was activated in late April 2002. The IV instrument is placed inside the USA
Laboratory module of the ISS and it was activated on April 21, 2001. These instruments continue to take data
up to the present time and are used as operational radiation dose level indicators, but these instruments are
also capable of particle and energy identiﬁcation. These data can provide information about the composition
of the lower radiation belts, shielding provided by Earth’s magnetosphere, and differences in the radiation
environments inside and outside the ISS. We present a preliminary look at the ISS radiation instrumentation
data with an overview of what we expect to be able to measure.
1. Introduction
The Extra—Vehicular (EV) and Intra—Vehicular (IV) Charged Particle Directional Spectrometer (CPDS) instru—
ments are aboard the International Space Station (ISS). The IV—CPDS instrument is located in the US lab
module and consists of a single CPDS telescope shown in Figure 1 (left). The EV—CPDS instrument is located
on a boom attached to the SO truss and consists of three CPDS telescopes (EVl, EV2, and EV3) pointing in
different directions, as shown in Figure 1 (right).

ISS.
The IV—CPDS instrument was sent to the ISS aboard STS—102 in March of 2001. It was installed in the US
Lab Module pointing in the forward direction (direction of ISS velocity vector). The daily operational glitches
were worked out over the next year and more routine and reliable operation began in J une 2002.
The EV—CPDS instrument was sent to the ISS aboard STS—l 10 in April of 2002 at the same time the SO truss
was installed. It was activated in late April of 2002 and began nominal operation in late 2002. EVl stopped

functioning in April 2003, and has yet to be recovered. The orientation of each of the CPDS units comprising
EV—CPDS are as follows: EVl points in the forward direction, EV2 points towards zenith and EV3 points aft.
Each CPDS contains a silicon detector stack, Which is illustrated in Figure 2. This stack Will be described from
top to bottom. A1 is a 1 mm thick square detector With 30.0 mm sides. PSDl and PSD2 are identical square
position sensitive detectors With 24 mm sides and are 300 pm thick. Each PSD is divided into 24 strips on top
and bottom, Which are orthogonal to one another, and this gives X—y position information. The A2 detector is
identical to A1 and these two detectors deﬁne the trigger for event coincidence Which yields a geometry factor
of 3.2 cm2—sr. Next are siX B detectors mounted on three cards. Each B detector is a 5 mm thick lithium drifted
[Si(Li)] cylindrical silicon detector With a physical diameter of 63.5 mm and an active diameter of 58.4 mm.
Below the B detectors is PSD3, Which is identical to the two previous PSDs. Next is A3, Which is identical
to A1 and A2. Last is the C detector complex, Which consists of a 10 mm thick, 50 mm diameter piece of
sapphire, Where Cerenkov light is produced, and a Hamamatsu photo—multiplier tube (PMT), Which converts
the light to an electronic signal. Both the sapphire and PMT are enclosed in a light tight aluminum “can”.
The individual detector cards are identical in design to those used on the MARIE instrument [?]. The only real
differences in the CPDS units and MARIE is the location of the C detector complex and the CPDS units have
one additional AB and PSD detector card.

components.
The data that can be expected from these instruments is similar to that of the MARIE instrument [?, ?, ?], al—
though the CPDS instruments have additional silicon detectors, therefore, the energy spectrum can be extended
up to about 400 MeV/n. Charge separation is possible up to about Z = 12, but the energy spectrum is only
available for Z < 4.

2. Discussion
The data shown in this paper is only the most recent data from J anuary to May of 2005. This data was Chosen
since it is devoid of any hardware threshold, high voltage, or software Changes. Making this selection removes
the EVl instrument data since it only operated through April 2003.
The instruments were all calibrated using in—ﬂight, low energy (30 < K E < 200 MeV/n) proton data and
comparing it to ﬁts of proton data tables [?] and instrument simulations performed by FLUKA [?, ?]. This
calibration procedure is the same as that used for the MARIE instrument and is described in detail elsewhere
[?].

Figure 3 shows the relative abundances of CNO detected by IV, EV2, and EV3. This plot Clearly shows
that the ISS shields a large majority of these heavy ions. The heavy ions that are not seen in the ISS are
either being stopped completely or are fragmenting, therefore, increasing the ﬂux of low Z particles inside the
ISS. Preliminary analysis shows that indeed the IV instrument is detecting more hydrogen ions than the EV
instruments.
This work has just begun so there is still much to do in understanding the data reported by these instruments, but
our experience with the MARIE instrument Will guide us. A complete monte carlo simulation of each of these
instruments Will be performed, Which Will test the current LEO radiation environment models. Comparisons,
of the CPDS data With ACE and GOES Will be done during SPE and solar quiet times, Which Will test our
current understanding of Charged particle interactions With the magnetosphere.

3. Conclusions

The IV—CPDS and EV—CPDS instruments offer a great opportunity to study the Charged particle space radiation
environment in LEO. Not only can these instruments be used for operational safety for the ISS crew, but they
can offer long term particle spectra observations that can be used to test the understanding of the lower region
of the trapped radiation and the GCR—magnetosphere interactions. These data can also offer additional data
points for observing the dynamics of the magnetosphere during solar particle events (SPE). Our models of the
LEO radiation environment must become more accurate as we begin sending more humans to space. Improved
models Will allow for safe operations in space for both the crew and radiation sensitive hardware. Prediction
of single event effects (SEE) in electronics must become more reliable as the electronic components used in
space decrease in size and become more susceptible to SEE. We expect that these data Will yield advances in
our understanding of the LEO radiation environment and What effect the Sun has on it.
