Abstract. It is believed that a microgravity environment may maintain ideal depletion zones of
protein (PDZ) and impurity (IDZ) around growing crystals and may contribute to growing
high-quality crystals. This can lead to an X-ray diffraction data collection of higher resolution with
lower rnosaioity, because of the better internal order and fewer defects in the crystals when
compared to ground-grown crystals. The extent of these depletion zones are dependent on a
competition between the diffusion of the molecules in the solution (indexed by the diffusion
coefﬁcient, D) and the adsorption of those into the growing crystal (indexed by the kinetic constant,
,8). If we use the D/ﬂ value as an index of the extent of PDZ and IDZ, a lower D/ﬂ value is ideal for
maintaining PDZ and IDZ. Using experimental results, we could easily obtain the D/ﬂ value. When
we combined the D/ﬂ value with the quality of protein crystals obtained in microgravity
experiments provided by J apanese Space Agency (J AXA), we found that the effects of microgravity
contributed to obtaining superior crystals especially if the D/ﬂ value was less than 3 mm. The
numerical analysis of the PDZ and IDZ shows that the radius of the crystal (R) is also related to the
PDZ and the IDZ. If the Rﬂ/D value is large, both the PDZ and the IDZ provide a ﬁltration effect,
but if the Rﬂ/D value is small, only the IDZ does.
Introduction

Although they say there are some positive effects of microgravity on higher quality protein
crystal growth [1], the mechanism for this effect has not been studied quantitatively yet. The
formation of a protein depletion zone (PDZ) and an impurity depletion zone (IDZ) were thought to
be the major reason [2]. However the PDZ formed around a lysozyme crystal grown in the
microgravity environment did not seem signiﬁcant enough to inﬂuence the superiorly ordered
protein molecules in the crystal, since the extent of the decrease of supersaturation was not
signiﬁcant, reported by Otalora et al. [3]. On the other hand, Thomas et al. [4] reported that there
was a signiﬁcant decrease of impurity incorporated into the miorogravity-grown crystals. Thus it
can be speculated that IDZ formation may be the most signiﬁcant reason for the superiority of
microgravity for growing high-quality crystals.

Tanaka et al. [5] studied those effects numerically using a simpliﬁed model for crystal growth.
Using this method, we compared the effectiveness of microgravity on the quality of protein crystals
from the Viewpoint of the ﬁltration effects of the PDZ and the IDZ. Our results suggested that the
PDZ and the IDZ are both adequately maintained if the diffusion of the molecules is slow, the
velocity of the molecular uptake into the crystal is fast, and the crystal size is sufﬁcient. However
the major reason for the improvement in our case was more related to the formation of IDZ than to
that of PDZ.

Numerical Model. Two types of depletion zones were expected to form around a growing crystal in
the convection-free environment. For the effects of PDZ, the driving force ratio (DFR) for
microgravity (0G) vs. ground-based (1G), deﬁned below, was the ratio of the degree of
supersaturation during the crystal growth for the same crystal size [5].

where 81' was a kinetic constant for impurity trapped in the crystal; Di was a diffusion coefﬁcient of
the impurity molecules; and Ci(R) and Ci(oo) were the concentrations of the impurity 0n the surface
of the crystal and far away from the crystal, respectively. To show IR change during the growth of
the crystal, an equation (2) was plotted against R,8/D as shown in Fig. 2. Because it was suggested
that the value 0f 81' was much larger than the value of ,8 [2], the value of 'A' in Fig. 2 was
presumptively determined to be 10~100 seemed realistic.
Protein Samples and Crystallization 0n the Ground. In total, 45 kinds of protein samples were
used for the crystallization experiments on the ground for the estimation of the D values and the ,8
values. The samples were further puriﬁed by some ionic exchange chromatography, if the
SDS-PAGE showed multiple bands. Puriﬁcation increased the ,8 values.
After puriﬁcation, we performed a crystallization experiment on the ground to measure the time
required for crystals to grow to half of their ﬁnal size (0/2). The crystallization experiment was
performed using the vapor diffusion method at 20°C. The crystallization was checked by
microscope every hour for several hours. After the crystals stopped growing, the ﬁnal radii were
measured. Although the counter-diffusion method was used for space experiment and also the batch
method was used for our simple method for ,8 estimation [5], we chose the vapor-diffusion method
to obtain {1/2. It was because the diffusion proﬁle of the eounter-diffusion method is so slow that the
extent of the super-saturation gradually changes during the crystallization, which was not preferable
for the accurate estimation. Actually, the batch method was the best for this purpose, but it was not
applicable to many proteins, because the optimization of the crystallization condition was rather
difﬁcult. Therefore we chose the vapor-diffusion method which is rather conventional and the
change of the extent of super-saturation during the crystallization is signiﬁcantly faster than the
counter-diffusion method.
D and 8 Estimation. The D value was estimated with a conventional equation [6]. For the
estimation of the ,8 value, 0/2, C(0) and R(oo) were measured experimentally, since the ,8 value can
be obtained by the following equation [7]
,8 _ 0.515 x 1000nR(oo)

r1 (6(0) — Ce)

5 (4)
where C(O) is the concentrations of protein (mg/ml) at the onset; R(oo) (mm) is the radius of the
crystal at its ﬁnal size; and n is the weight density of the crystal. For a rough estimation, Ce was
assumed to be 0.

Crystallization in Microgravity. Crystallization in the microgravity environment was performed at
293 K inside the Protein Crystallization Research Facility onboard the J apanese Experiment Module,
Kibo, 0n the International Space Station (188) for 11 weeks from July to October, 2009 in JAXA
PCG#1; for 17 weeks from February to June, 2010 in JAXA PCG#2; and for 11 weeks from
September to November, 2010 in JAXA PCG#3. For crystallization, JAXA adopted a
eounter-diffusion method [8, 9]. Assembly of the crystallization device was described previously
[10]. Crystallization conditions were ﬁxed to start erystallizing after the samples arrived in the
microgravity environment. The same crystallization condition was applied to the terrestrial
experiment as the control.

Results and Discussion

Totally more than 150 protein samples were launched in JAXA PCG#1, #2 and #3 ﬂight
experiments. The number of protein samples whose D/,8 value were estimated before launch and the
number that were successfully grown to larger single crystals were 45 and 25, respectively. A
summary of the results is listed in Table l, and the data of the effective samples when the

by the maximum X-ray resolution and/or the mosaicity 0f the crystals in this study. As shown in

Table 1, the rate of the effective samples was higher if the D/ﬂ value was lower. When the D/ﬂ value

was less than 3 mm, more than 75% 0f the samples were positively affected by the microgravity

environment to grow higher quality crystals. It was consistent with the numerical analysis as shown

in Fig. 1 and Fig. 2, which showed that a lower D/ﬂ and larger crystal radius (R) could work to

enhance the ﬁltering effects of protein and impurity by forming a PDZ and IDZ for better crystal

quality.

This meant that IR, not DFR, was signiﬁcantly reduced, suggesting that the impurity ﬁltering effect

worked to grow crystals of superior quality in the microgravity environment in this case. For a

larger ‘A’ value, this tendency becomes much more signiﬁcant. So far, for most of the cases in our

microgravity experiments, most of the crystals were for X-ray diffraction crystallography. Therefore,

the crystals did not usually grow large enough to increase the Rﬂ/D values, so only the impurity

ﬁltration effect could be expected. However, if we grow crystals large enough for neutron

crystallography, both PDZ and IDZ can be expected.
