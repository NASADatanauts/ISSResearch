Several passive detectors were used to estimate dosimetry and microdosimetry characteristics of radiation ﬁeld onboard
spacecraft, namely: thermoluminescent detectors (TLDs), mainly to appreciate the contribution of radiation with low-linear
energy transfer (LET); Si diode, to try to establish the contribution of fast neutrons; an LET spectrometer based on the
chemically etched polyallyldiglycolcarbonate etched track detectors (PADC-TEDs). Detectors have been exposed onboard
MIR and International Space Station (ISS) since 1997, they were also used during the MESSAGE 2 biological experiment,
October 2003. The results are presented, analysed and discussed. Particular attention is devoted to the possibility of g
estimating neutron contribution based on data obtained with PADC-TED spectrometer of LET. g
