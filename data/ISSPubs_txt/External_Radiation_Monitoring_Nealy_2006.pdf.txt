Abstract
The HZETRN code has been identiﬁed by NASA for engineering design in the next phase of space exploration highlighting a return
to the Moon in preparation for a Mars mission. In response, a new series of algorithms beginning With 2005 HZETRN, Will be issued by
correcting some prior limitations and improving control of propagated errors along With established code veriﬁcation processes. Code
validation processes Will use neW/improved 10W Earth orbit (LEO) environmental models With a recently improved International Space
Station (188) shield model to validate computational models and procedures using measured data aboard 188. These validated models
Will provide a basis for ﬂight—testing the designs of future space vehicles and systems of the Constellation program in the LEO
environment.

a Crew Exploration Vehicle, CEV). We have Chosen the
1995 HZETRN version for this early spiral development.
This code has had wide distribution and is largely the code
used in the prior veriﬁcation and validation processes
described by Wilson et al. (2005). However, an assessment i7 , - _
of the 1995 HZETRN code status demands the re-evalua-
tion of the computational procedures and databases to
account for software and database drift over the last ten
years and the inherent limitations of these prior eomputa- '
tional procedures. In the present paper, we reView the basic
derivations to identify oversights and improve solution sta-
