Abstract - The present paper deals with the ""critical analysis"" of the environment that will be provided by the MDS (Mice
Drawer System) under microgravity conditions. This system will be used to study the ""extended"" growth and life of mice on the
International Space Station (188). A very long period (100 days) will be investigated taking advantage of the availability of the
ISS platform. The complex physical-cheinical system (ﬂuid-dynainics, ventilation, air-conditioning, oxygen and carbon dioxide
levels and distributions, etc.) that will be established in absence of gravity inside the MDS is simulated through solution of a
custom system of partial differential equations. The choice of custom model is motivated by the advantage to insert boundary
conditions and complex equations that provide a clear understanding of the phenomena involved and a wide spectrum
information to match the requirements for the maintenance and the well-being of the animals.
