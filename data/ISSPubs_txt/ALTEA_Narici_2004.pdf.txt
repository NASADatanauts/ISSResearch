Abstract
The ALTEA project investigates the risks of functional brain damage induced by particle radiation in space. A modular facility
(the ALTEA facility) is being implemented and Will be operated in the International Space Station (ISS) to record electrophysio—
logical and behavioral descriptors of brain function and to monitor their time dynamics and correlation With particles and space
environment. The focus of the program Will be on abnormal Visual perceptions (often reported as “light ﬂashes” by astronauts) and
the impact on retinal and brain Visual structures of particle in microgravity conditions. The facility Will be made available to the
international scientiﬁc community for human neurophysiological, electrophysiological and psychophysics experiments, studies on
particle ﬂuxes, and dosimetry.
A precursor of ALTEA (the ‘Alteino’ project) helps set the experimental baseline for the ALTEA experiments, while providing
novel information on the radiation environment onboard the ISS and on the brain electrophysiology of the astronauts during orbital

and accelerator beams complete the experimental strategy of ALTEA. We present here the status of progress of the ALTEA project
and preliminary results of the Alteino study on brain dynamics, particle ﬂuxes and abnormal Visual perceptions.
