|. Introduction

The opportunity to exploit the electroencephalographic activity (EEG)
for controlling computer (brain—eomputing interface, BCI) or machine (brain—
machine interface, BMI) has opened a new ﬁeld in neuroscience and has also
paved the way for their future application in space missions. However, in spite of
their exponential development on Earth, a more comprehensive understanding of
brain behavior in microgravity needs to be developed before BCI or BMI can be
reliably and fully utilized in space mission. This chapter will outline current
understanding of brain EEG rhythms in relation to their potential applications
in BMI in space.

H. Spontaneous EEG Fluctuations: Where is the Baseline?

Whatever the detection system used the search of a functional baseline
remains a challenge (Gusnard and Raiehle, 2001). This neeessarily implies the
control of the resting or default condition of the awaken brain. This default state
cannot be regarded as “a simple resting state” but a complex situation involving
dynamic interplay between conscious and unconscious processes. Such a brain
state can be considered as a transient equilibrium integrating all aspects of past
history for future prediction use (Buzsaki, 2006). This “default” mode of the
brain is also related to the concept of the “global work space” of consciousness
(Baars et aL, 2003) in which an “observing” or a “homunculus” function is
exerted by the frontal pole of the brain on its own sensory inﬂux (Crick and
Koch, 2003). In this framework, the Malaeh’s group has found with flVIRI
technique that a large part of the cortex consistently responded when subjects
were exposed to an audiovisual movie providing a rich and multidimensional
natural stimuli (Hasson et aL, 2004) but this activated pattern was at the same
time accompanied by the presence of persistent “cortical islands” which failed to
respond in a Clear time-loeked manner to the movie stimulation. It was also
demonstrated that these regions were not silent during movie watching, but that
they displayed a well-eorrelated spontaneous activity throughout the different
“islands” forming a functional chain of an “intrinsic” system organized in
complement to the “extrinsic” system dealing with processing of the sensory
inﬂux (Goldberg et aL, 2008; Golland et a[., 2007, 2008).

The “intrinsic” attractor state can also modify the brain’s ability to analyze
environmental information and to organize ﬁnal action. Interestingly, the prefron-
tal cortex engaged in self—related introspective processes is inhibited during senso-
rimotor processing (Goldberg et aL, 2006). This antagonistic and patehwork-like

"

organization largely complicated the deﬁnition of a functional baseline because it
necessitates a previous knowledge of the “extrinsic” and “intrinsic” networks
localization during a particular task. As the free will is central for the initiation
of a BCI process, a better understanding of the “intrinsic” system behavior is
urgently required. However, the tendency to different human individuals to
present similar patterns of brain activation when they are confronted to natural
Visual scenes (Hasson and Malaeh, 2006) encourages the utilization of ecological
Virtual reality stimulator for deciphering the dynamical dialogue between intrinsic
and extrinsic neural network in real space work. Ideally, the baseline should be
better deﬁned as a physiological state, rather than just the arbitrary period
preceding the task (Buzsaki, 2006).

The BCI approaches are thus constrained by another emerging pattern of
collective network: brain oscillations are inherently linked to the neuronal behav-
ior that gave rise to it and in turn, deﬁnitely inﬂuence the global behavior of the
system. This also implies a high level of control of “state transitions” in EEG
activity. It was demonstrated that each transition began with an abrupt phase
resetting followed by resynchronization, spatial pattern stabilization, and increase
in global pattern amplitude (Freeman, 2004).

""I. How to Manage Alpha and Mu Oscillations in Space

In the last few years, EEG applied in the emerging ﬁeld of neuronal
oscillations (Buzsaki and Draguhn, 2004) has provided new insights into the
neurophysiologieal activity underlying perceptual processes in the brain and
represent the principal noninvasive signals for BCI purpose. Surprisingly, the
BCI control Obtained with sealp-reeorded EEG rhythms is situated in the same
performance range in terms of speed and precision as the control Obtained with
intraeortieal ensemble of single neurons (Wolpaw, 2007). This is a facilitating
aspect for future research in this ﬁeld. Among the different EEG activities
extending from very slow to ultrafast frequencies, the alpha rhythm around
10 Hz (range 8—12 Hz) is the most prominent rhythm Observed in awake, relaxed
subjects (Berger, 1929) and corresponds to the mu rhythm over the sensorimotor
cortex (Gastaut, 1952 ; Pfurtseheller et a[., 1996).

A combination of mu and beta oscillations has been successfully used for
controlling a cursor on a computer screen (Krusienski et a1, 2007; Wolpaw and
McFarland, 2004). This was accomplished thanks to an intensive training of the
subject and the help of an adaptive algorithm providing a weighting mixture of
mu and beta rhythm depending of the desired cursor direction.

In the context of space mission (NeuroCog I) we used the arrest reaction
(Berger, 1929) Of the alpha rhythm for studying the effects of microgravity 0n the

"

spontaneous alpha dynamics (Cheron et a[., 2006). Our working hypothesis was
that because alpha rhythm has a functional role in the regulation of network
properties, microgravity can be expected to modify the strength of this regulation
in order to preserve the network functionality in a novel environment.

F igure 1 illustrates the raw EEG recorded in the International Space Station
(188) in one cosmonaut during the arrest reaction. In the eyes—elosed state, the
alpha rhythm appears as spindle-shaped episodes of lO-Hz oscillation that domi-
nate the spontaneous activity of the brain. We showed that the power spectrum of
the alpha rhythm in the eyes—elosed state is signiﬁcantly increased in microgravity
compared to that measured on Earth. The same picture was also found for the mu
rhythm (Leroy et a[., 2007). We also deﬁned a suppression coefﬁcient (SC) which
was also signiﬁcantly increased in microgravity (Fig. 1B). (Steriade, 2000). The
large amplitude of the alpha rhythm would result from a coherent cortical drive
from the thalamus coincident with a lack of other input. In this theoretical
framework, that is compatible with Criek’s spotlight—of—attention hypothesis
(Crick, 1984), microgravity could facilitate the expression of a single-peak
lO-Hz dominant rhythm at rest. The alpha rhythm has also been considered as
a mechanism for increasing signal—to—noise ratios within the cortex by means of
inhibition of unnecessary or conﬂicting processes to the current task (Klimeseh,
1999; Klimeseh et a[., 2000). The perturbation of the reference frame and the
sensory conﬂicts produced by microgravity could necessitate such a type of
regulation.

Whatever the exact mechanisms involved, our ﬁnding of enhanced alpha and
mu rhythm in microgravity suggests their implication in general mechanisms of
multiple sensorimotor conﬂict solving and integration which should be taken into
account in future use of BCI in microgravity.

IV. From the Identification Process to the Exploitation of Brain Oscillations in Space

Classically, a BCI approach consists to ﬁrstly identify the brain signals (fre-
quency bands and location of interest) and then to develop appropriate methods
to extract and exploit the signals in order to further control an external device
(Blankertz et a[., 2007, Tonet 6t 0]., 2008, for a review). However, paradoxically
when the initial identiﬁcation procedure was ﬁnalized and the subject asked to
produce the mental task and ﬁnal goal for controlling the output device, the
originally detected brain signals change further inducing some alterations in the
BCI performance (Sehalk et a[., 2008). Such undesirable feedback or paradoxical
effect shows that a better identiﬁcation and extraction procedure of brain
oscillations will not necessarily allow an improved BCI performance. In spite
of the helpful adaptive abilities of a new BCI processing named SIGFRIED

(Sehalk et a[.; 2008) the problem of baseline deﬁnition during the resting period
prior to mental action and their generalization ability remain unresolved. If this
type of problem is already difﬁcult to manage on Earth it will became highly
critical in space condition.

In weightlessness; the adaptation of the default state and the reorganization of
the “top- down” control of the neuronal activities may render BCI application
very Challenged. An example of such reorganization of brain EEG oscillations in
space missions is given by the EEG recordings performed during Virtual naviga-
tion experiments conducted on the ground and in the ISS during N euroCog ESA
experiments. In spite of the fact that the cosmonauts were immerged in the same
conﬁned Virtual environment; the distribution of the basic EEG rhythms signiﬁ-
cantly change at the different time of the navigation in comparison to the
performance for the same task on Earth. In this protocol the cosmonaut was
involved in a 3D navigation task initiated by the presentation of the Virtual 3D
tunnel that directly contains directional information related to the gravitational
frame of reference (Vidal et al.; 2003; see Fig. 2 for the description of the task).
Preliminary results have shown that the EEG rhythmic activities were modiﬁed
during the navigational task (Bengoetxea et 01.; 2006; 2007; Cebolla et a[.; 2006).
On Earth; the presentation of the tunnel was ﬁrstly accompanied by a power
increase in the theta frequency band during about 300 ms followed by a decrease
in the alpha band (Fig. 3B). In weightlessness; the ERSP map is Clearly different;
the initial increase in the theta band and the decrease in the alpha band were less
marked than on Earth. Moreover; additional power increase in alpha; beta; and
gamma bands occurred in weightlessness (Fig. 3D—G). This Observation deﬁnitely
signed the emergence of a different oscillating state of the brain while the Virtual
reality environment has remained the same as on the Earth.

V. The Influence of ""Top-Down” Dynamics on BCI Approach

Recent advances in cognitive neuroscience have placed the basic neurophysi-
ologieal processes upon which the BCI should promote new areas of application.
One Of the major relevant concepts is a “tOp-down” processing considered on a
dynamical point of View as a large scale neuronal inﬂuence exerted on small local
group of neurons; the latter being literally absorbed by the global “tOp-down”
dynamics. When neurons are highly synchronized they produce local ﬁeld poten-
tials (oscillating ﬁeld at the basis of EEG) which are in turn able to recruit new
neurons (Cheron et al.; 2008; Servais and Cheron; 2005). This constitutes a
positive feedback loop where a speciﬁc oscillation would be the cause and the
consequence of neuronal synchronicity.

FIG. 2. (A) Photograph of Frank De Winne on board 188 doing the N eurocog Virtual navigation
task in freeﬂoating condition under the control of Sergei Zaletin. (B) Virtual reality scenes representing
self-navigation were presented through a tunnel by a barrel frame to the laptop screen. On the press of
a button, the subject will appear to either move through a tunnel (C) at constant speed, passing through
a single bend between two linear segments. At the end of the trial, by manipulating the trackball, the
subject adjusts the magnitude of the turn to reconstructs a planar representation of the Virtual tunnel
just experienced.

The tOp-down concept is in accordance with the temporal binding model
(Engel and Singer; 2001; Singer and Gray; 1995) in which a neuronal synchrony
of about 1 ms is necessary for performing object recognition (binding); attention;
response selection; and action. The intrinsic capacity of the neuronal assemblies
for synchronization is at the basis of the tOp-down control allowing interaction on
a large scale for the selection of pertinent neuronal correlation (Fries 615651.; 1997;
2001; Varela et a1, 2001). Whatever the BCI communication technology and the
learning paradigm used; such approach will remain largely dependent of this
neuronal dynamics. Indeed; the weightlessness environment may inﬂuence the
“tOp-down” dynamics of the brain by different ways including basic changes in
the multiple sensory processing for substitution of graviceptive gating or more
global modiﬁcation in awareness; emotional; and cognitive purposes (Cheron
615651.; 2006; Leroy et a1; 2007; Schneider et al., 2007a,b).

VI. Gamma EEG Oscillations: A Window into Cognition, Perception, Aﬂention,
Binding, or Microsaccaclic Eye Movements

The ﬁrst demonstration of the functional role of neuronal gamma-band
synchronization was provided by invasive mieroeleetrode recordings of spikes
and local ﬁeld potentials in the Visual cortex of anesthetized eats (Eekhorn et a[.;
1988; Gray and Singer; 1989; Gray et a[.; 1989; Engel et a[.; 1991) and later
conﬁrmed in Visual cortex of alert monkey (Fries et a[.; 2001; Kreiter and Singer;
1996). These important experiments have paved the way for the binding-by-
gamma oscillation originally promoted by F reeman (1975) in the Olfactory bulb
and theoretically sustained by the mechanism of synchrony (von der Malsburg;
1985). N ovel signal-proeessing techniques for the detection of transient oscillatory
events and the introduction of new source modeling methods (Delorme and
Makeig; 2004; Delorme et a[.; 2007; LaehauX; 2003; Makeig; 1993; Palmero—
Soler et a[.; 2007) have facilitated the study Of gamma oscillations in human EEG
(Jensen et a[.; 2007 for a review).

Since pioneering MEG studies (Ribary et a[.; 1991; L1inas and Ribary; 1993);
the interest in the study Of gamma oscillation with EEG and MEG increased
strongly and their involvement was described in relation to sensorimotor task
(Aoki et a[.; 1999; Donoghue et a[.; 1998; Murthy and F etz; 1992); perception
(Tallon-Baudry et a[.; 1996; 1997; 2005; Keil et a[.; 1999); attention (Gruber et a[.;
1999); working memory (Tallon-Baudry et a[.; 1998; Lutzenberger et a1, 2002);
and associative memory (Gruber et a[.; 2001). In the ease of gamma EEG record-
ings; a very recent study (Yuval-Greenberg et a[.; 2008) has Clearly demonstrated
by single trial analysis Of EEG and concomitant eye movement that the induced
gamma-band EEG response occurring about 200—300 ms following stimulus
onset correspond to miniature saecade dynamics (spike potentials) rather than
neuronal oscillations. However; this study does not raise any doubt regarding the
intracranial recordings and the important role of gamma-band activity in neural
function; but it urgently demonstrated the necessity to control mierosaeeade
events during any type of BCI protocol. This is also reinforced by the fact that
eye movement generation is modiﬁed in microgravity (Kornilova et a[.; 1991).

VII. The Gating of the Somatosensory-Evokecl Potentials as a New Tools for BCI

One possible way to avoid the problem of the brain state ﬂuctuation for the
deﬁnition of the baseline and the optimization of the identiﬁcation process should
be to use the gating approach of the earlier somatosensory-evoked potential
(SEP). Dynamic gating is a key aspect of neural processing allowing to select

"

and enhance integration of stimuli and events that are most relevant in order to
keep the focus on speciﬁc goals in the face of numerous environmental distrac-
tions (O’Reilly, 2006). In this context, single electrical stimuli 0n the median nerve
0n the wrist may be Viewed as repetitive sensory events upon which a speciﬁc
brain state is organized. This also reduces the degree of freedom of the default
baseline state for a BCI extraction. As grasping task is a possible outcome for BCI
action it is relevant to note that sensory integration during such reaching move-
ment is a dynamic process driven by the task computational demands (Sober and
Sabes, 2005) during which gating mechanisms involve multiple parallel circuits
including loops between the cortex, the basal ganglia and the thalamus.

A possible way for noninvasive investigation of these processes and their
possible use for BCI purpose reside ﬁrstly in the analysis of the spectral content
of neuronal oscillatory activity recorded in EEG signals around the time of
sensory stimulus and then to control the dynamic modiﬁcations induced on this
controlled state by a sensory or mental task (gating condition). The electrical
median nerve stimulation provides a convenient and easily quantiﬁed sensory
input for the study Of the gating process and their future use in BCI. We have
focused our attention on the frontal N 30 SEP component (Cheron 6t 01., 2007,
Cebolla et a[., 2008). The early occurrence of this negative component (~30 ms)
after the stimulus and their high sensitivity to gating from concomitant involve-
ment of the brain in sensory, motor, and mental activities (Cheron and
Berenstein, 1987, 1991, 1992; Rossini et a[., 1999; Rushton et a[., 1981) is
important for their future used in BCI context. Indeed, the amplitude of the
frontal N 30 signiﬁcantly decreases when the stimulated hand performs an actual
movement or during movement imagery (Cheron and Berenstein, 1991, 1992;
Cheron et a[., 2000).

Recently, we have demonstrated that the N 30 SEP component was accom-
panied by an increase of the power spectrum of beta/gamma rhythm peaking at
30 Hz and by a concomitant increase of the inter trials coherence (phase—loeking)
at this frequency band (Cheron et a[., 2007) (Fig. 4). Pure phase-loeking 0f the
beta/gamma rhythm was found in a large percentage of the trials. The gating of
the N 30 amplitude was accompanied by a signiﬁcant reduction of the phase-
loeking value at 30 Hz (Fig. 5). This disorganization 0f the beta/gamma oscilla-
tion phase-loeking by the gating is illustrated by the comparison of the super-
imposition of the ﬁltered (25—35 Hz) EEG trials at rest (Fig. 4E) and during the
gating (Fig. 5D).

The application of the recent methodology of F reeman (2007) for the extrac-
tion and Classiﬁcation Offeature vectors may be applied on the frontal N 30 gating.
Linear decomposition with the Hilbert transform 0n the frontal electrodes during
the median nerve stimulation at rest and during motor imagery may provide
different state variables for adequate BCI application (Freeman, 2007). The great
advantage is that after band-pass ﬁltering of the beta—gamma brain wave

FIG. 5. Grand average of time/frequeney template from ERSP (A) and ITC (B) analysis in
relation to the frontal N 30 component recorded during the movement gating paradigm with the
same median nerve stimulation as in Fig. 1. Note that the suppression of both ERSP (A) and ITC
(B) accompany the N 30 gating (C). (D) Superimposition of 10 (upper traces group) and 100 (lower
traces group) single ﬁltered (2 5*35 Hz) EEG trials with respect to median nerve stimulation illustrating
the disorganisation of the beta phase-loeking by the movement gating. Adapted with permission from

sustaining the N 30, the Hilbert transform will decomposes this brain wave into an
analytic amplitude, A(t) and analytic phase <I>(t) allowing the possibility to identify
EEG goal-oriented state transition for future use as BCI commands. A similar
approach based on steady-state Visual-evoked potentials has been proposed to
control a BCI (Allison et 01., 2008).
