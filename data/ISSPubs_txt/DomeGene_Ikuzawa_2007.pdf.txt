Abstract
Random positioning machine (RPM) devices that generate a simulated microgravity environment of approximately 0g prevent the
formation of dome structures in Xenopus kidney—derived A6 cells. In the present study, the gene expression proﬁle of A6 cells cultured
under RPM was determined using the Xenopus 22K scale microarray, and those genes up— or downregulated twofold or more were inves—
tigated. We identiﬁed 29 genes (up, 25 genes; down, 4 genes) on day 5, 68 genes (up, 25 genes; down, 43 genes) on day 8, 111 genes (up, 69
genes; down, 42 genes) on day 10, and 283 genes (up, 153 genes; down, 130 genes) on day 15 of culture under RPM. These genes were
classiﬁed according to categories described in the KOG database, such as “extracellular structure”, “cytoskeleton”, and “transcription”.
Almost all the genes involved in “inorganic ion transport and metabolism” were downregulated under RPM. Our study further inves—
tigated some of these including the epithelial Na+ channel (ENaC) and NaT/KT—ATPase transporter genes. A speciﬁc inhibitor of
NaT/KT—ATPases, ouabain, inhibited dome formation in the A6 cells, even under control culturing conditions of 1g (the static condi—
tion). Together these data suggested that downregulation of sodium ion transporter gene expression plays a signiﬁcant role in the
RPM—dependent prevention of the dome formation in kidney epithelial cells.
