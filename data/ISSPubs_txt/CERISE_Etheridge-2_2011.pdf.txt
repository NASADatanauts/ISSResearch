Abstract
Background: Overcoming spaceflight-induced (patho)physiologic adaptations is a major challenge preventing Iong—term
deep space exploration. RNA interference (RNAi) has emerged as a promising therapeutic for combating diseases on Earth;
however the efficacy of RNAi in space is currently unknown.
Methods: Caenorhabditis elegans were prepared in liquid media on Earth using standard techniques and treated acutely
with RNAi or a vector control upon arrival in Low Earth Orbit. After culturing during 4 and 8 d spaceflight, experiments were
stopped by freezing at —800C until analysis by mRNA and microRNA array chips, microscopy and Western blot on return to
Earth. Ground controls (GC) on Earth were simultaneously grown under identical conditions.
Results:After 8 d spaceflight, mRNA expression levels of components of the RNAi machinery were not different from that in
GC (e.g., Dicer, Argonaute, Piwi; P>0.05). The expression of 228 microRNAs, of the 232 analysed, were also unaffected during
4 and 8 d spaceflight (P>0.05). In spaceflight, RNAi against green fluorescent protein (gfp) reduced chromosomal gfp
expression in gonad tissue, which was not different from GC. RNAi against rbX-1 also induced abnormal chromosome
segregation in the gonad during spaceflight as on Earth. Finally, culture in RNAi against lysosomal cathepsins prevented
degradation of the muscIe-specific oc-actin protein in both spaceflight and GC conditions.
Conclusions: Treatment with RNAi works as effectively in the space environment as on Earth within multiple tissues,
suggesting RNAi may provide an effective tool for combating spaceflight-induced pathologies aboard future long-duration
space missions. Furthermore, this is the first demonstration that RNAi can be utilised to block muscle protein degradation,
both on Earth and in space.
