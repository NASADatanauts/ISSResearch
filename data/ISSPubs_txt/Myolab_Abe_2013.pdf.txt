Background. Unloading stress induces skeletal muscle atrophy. We have reported that Cbl-b ubiquitin ligase is a master regulator
of unloading-associated muscle atrophy. The present study was designed to elucidate whether dietary soy glycinin protein prevents
denervation-mediated muscle atrophy, based on the presence of inhibitory peptides against Cbl-b ubiquitin ligase in soy glycinin
protein. Methods. Mice were fed either 20% casein diet, 20% soy protein isolate diet, 10% glycinin diet containing 10% casein, or
20% glycinin diet. One week later, the right sciatic nerve was cut. The wet weight, cross sectional area (CSA), IGF-l signaling, and
atrogene expression in hindlimb muscles were examined at 1, 3, 3.5, or 4 days after denervation. Results. 20% soy glycinin diet
signiﬁcantly prevented denervation-induced decreases in muscle wet weight and myoﬁber CSA. Furthermore, dietary soy protein
inhibited denervation-induced ubiquitination and degradation of IRS-l in tibialis anterior muscle. Dietary soy glycinin partially
suppressed the denervation-mediated expression of atrogenes, such as MAFbX/atrogin-l and MuRF-l, through the protection
of IGF-1 signaling estimated by phosphorylation of Akt-l. Conclusions. Soy glycinin contains a functional inhibitory sequence
against muscle-atrophy-associated ubiquitin ligase Cbl-b. Dietary soy glycinin protein signiﬁcantly prevented muscle atrophy after
denervation in mice.
