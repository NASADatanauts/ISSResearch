Abstract
Various environmental stresses elevate the phosphorylation level of eukaryotic translation initiation factor 2 alpha (eIF2oc) and induce
transcriptional activation of a set of stress responsive genes such as activating transcription factors 3 and 6 (ATF3 and ATF6), CCAAT/
enhancer-binding protein homologous protein (CHOP), and Xbpl (X—box binding protein 1). These stress sources include radiation, oxi—
dation, and stress to the endoplasmic reticulum, and it is recently reported that unloading by hindlimb unloading is such a stress source.
No studies, however, have examined the phosphorylation level of eIF2oc (eIF2oc—p) using skeletal samples that have experienced micro—
gravity in space. In this study we addressed a question: Does a mouse tibia ﬂown in space show altered levels of eIF2oc—p? To address this
question, we obtained STS—135 ﬂown samples that were harvested 4—7 h after landing. The tibia and femur isolated from hindlimb
unloaded mice were employed as non—ﬂight controls. The effects of loading were also investigated in non— ﬂight controls. Results indicate
that the level of eIF2oc—p of the non—ﬂight controls was elevated during hindlimb unloading and reduced after being released from unload—
ing. Second, the eIF2oc—p level of space—ﬂown samples was decreased, and mechanical loading to the tibia caused the reduction of the
eIF2oc—p level. Third, the mRNA levels of ATF3, ATF6, and CHOP were lowered in space—ﬂown samples as well as in the non—ﬂight
samples 4—7 h after being released from unloading. Collectively, the results herein indicated that a release from hindlimb unloading
and a return to normal weight environment from space provided a suppressive effect to eIF2oc—1inked stress responses and that a period
of 2—4 h is suﬂicient to induce this suppressive outcome.
