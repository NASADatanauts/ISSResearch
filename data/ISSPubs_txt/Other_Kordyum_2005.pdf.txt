Abstract
Cytoskeleton recently attracted wide attention of cell and molecular biologists due to its crucial role in gravity sensing
and trunsduction. Most of cytoskeletal research is conducted by the means of immunohistochemical reactions, different mod-
iﬁcations of Which are beneﬁcial for the ground-based experiments. But for the performance onboard the space vehicles,
they represent quite complicated technique Which requires time and special skills for astronauts. In addition, immunocyto-
chemistry provides only static images of the cytoskeleton arrangement in ﬁxed cells while its localization in living cells is
needed for the better understanding of cytoskeletal function. In this connection, we propose a new approach for cytoskeletal
Visualization onboard the ISS, namely, application of green ﬂuorescent protein (GFP) from Aequorea victaria, Which has
the unique properties as a marker for protein localization in ViVO. The creation of chimerical protein—GFP gene constructs,
obtaining the transformed plant cells possessed protein—GFP in their cytoskeletal composition will allow receiving a simple
and efﬁcient model for screening of the cytoskeleton functional status in microgravity.
