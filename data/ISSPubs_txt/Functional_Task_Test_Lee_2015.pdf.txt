"1","ISS EXCERCISE COUNTERMEASURES —
Orthostatlc Intolerance After ISS and Space
Shuttle MISSIons

INTRODUCTION: Cardiovascular deconditioning apparently progresses with ﬂight duration, resulting in a greater incidence of orthostatic

intolerance following Iong—duration missions.Therefore, we anticipated that the proportion of astronauts who could not
complete an orthostatic ti|t test (OTT) would be higher on landing day and the number ofdays to recover greater after
International Space Station (ISS) than after Space Shuttle missions.

METHODS: There were 20 ISS and 65 Shuttle astronauts who participated in 10-min 80° head-up ti|t tests 10 d before launch, on
landing day (R+O), and 3 d after landing (R+3). Fisher’s Exact Test was used to compare the ability of ISS and Shuttle
astronauts to complete the OTT. Cox regression was used to identify cardiovascular parameters associated with OTT
completion and mixed model analysis was used to compare the change and recovery rates between groups.

RESULTS: The proportion of astronauts who completed the OTT on R+0 (2 of 6) was less in ISS than in Shuttle astronauts (52 of 65).
On R+3, 13 of 15 and 19 of 19 of the ISS and Shuttle astronauts, respectively, completed the OTT. An index comprised of
stroke volume and diastolic blood pressure provided a good prediction of OTT completion and was altered by space-
ﬂight similarly for both astronaut groups, but recovery was slower in ISS than in Shuttle astronauts.

CONCLUSIONS: The proportion of ISS astronauts who could not complete the OTT on R+O was greater and the recovery rate slower after
ISS compared to Shuttle missions.Thus, mission planners and crew surgeons should anticipate the need to tailor
scheduled activities and level of medical support to accommodate protracted recovery after long-duration microgravity
exposures.
