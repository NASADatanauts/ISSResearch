The Micro-Particles Capturer and Space Environment Exposure Device is the J apan Aerospace Exploration
Agency’s experiment on particle capture and space exposure of material mounted on an aluminum tray. The trays
were placed on the exterior of the Russian service module of the International Space Station. All trays were retrieved
and returned to Earth. This paper presents our analysis of the effects that space exposure imparted 0n the monitoring
samples in the ﬁrst- and second-retrieved Micro-Particles Capturer and Space Environment Exposure Device trays.
The monitoring samples yield space-environment data such as atomic oxygen, ultraviolet, ﬂuence, and space
3 radiation dose data. The exposure and monitoring samples were retrieved after 315 and 865 days of exposure.
