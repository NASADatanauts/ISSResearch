Abstract
Three—dimensional (3—D) velocity ﬁeld reconstruction of oscillatory thermocapillary convections in a half—zone liquid bridge with a
radius of O (1 mm) was carried out by applying 3—D particle tracking velocimetry (PTV). Simultaneous observation of the particles sus—
pended in the bridge by two CCD cameras was carried out by placing a small cubic beam splitter above a transparent top rod. The recon—
struction of the 3—D trajectories and the velocity ﬁelds of the particles in the several types of oscillatory—ﬂow regimes were conducted
successfully for suﬁiciently long period without losing particle tracking. With this application the present authors conducted a series
of experiments focusing upon the collapse and re—formation process of the PAS by mechanically disturbing fully developed PAS.
