ABSTRACT
The Remote Atmospheric and Ionospheric Detection System (RAIDS) is a suite of eight sensors covering wave—
lengths from 55 to 874 nm that has been developed for comprehensive remote sensing of the upper atmosphere.
Initially designed to orbit on a higher—altitude TIROS satellite, the RAIDS experiment has been refurbished for
a new mission on the International Space Station Japanese Experiment Module Exposed Facility (JEM—EF).
RAIDS measures the altitude proﬁles of dayglow and nightglow emissions for speciﬁcation of key ionospheric and
thermospheric constituents. This paper details four of the RAIDS sensors that will measure spectral features in
the extreme (55—110 nm), far (130—180 nm), middle (200—300 nm), and near (300—400 nm) ultraviolet bands. The
radiometric and spectral recharacterization of these sensors is highlighted, along with an overview of the primary
features that this combination of experiments will measure to provide an unique perspective on the response of

the ionosphere and thermosphere to space weather events.

1. INTRODUCTION
The Remote Atmospheric and Ionospheric Detection System (RAIDS) is a suite of eight instruments designed
to provide comprehensive measurements of terrestrial airglow from 55 to 874 nm. The far—ultraviolet (130—180
nm) spectrograph, the middle—ultraviolet (200—300 nm) spectrometer, and the near—ultraviolet (300—400 nm)
spectrometer were provided by the Naval Research Laboratory. The extreme ultraviolet spectrograph (55—110
nm), the near—infrared spectrometer (722—874 nm), and the three photometers (777.4, 765.0, and 630.0 nm)
were supplied by The Aerospace Corporation. Originally designed to be launched on the National Oceanic
and Atmospheric Administration TIROS—J spacecraft in the early 1990’s, the RAIDS experiment has been
reconﬁgured for operation aboard the Japanese Experiment Module (“Kibo”) Exposed Facility (JEM—EF) 0n
the International Space Station (ISS). A full mission overview including a description of these modiﬁcations to
the RAIDS experiment that were required to meet the accommodations for this new ﬂight opportunity have
been described in more detail in the companion paper by Budzien et al.1 contained in these proceedings.

The new goal of the RAIDS experiment is to measure the temperature and composition of the lower ther—
rnosphere and ionosphere from 100—200 km by measuring altitude proﬁles of key airglow emissions across the
spectrum. In most cases, these emission proﬁles will be inverted using well—developed aeronornic models to infer
the state of the thermosphere and ionosphere. In several cases emissions from multiple instruments can be used
to obtain the same parameter, thereby providing an internal mechanism for validation of the parameters. In
addition, coincident measurements from other space— and ground—based platforms will provide important checks
on the measurements and derived values. Because the ISS orbits at altitudes below most space—based sensors,
RAIDS provides a unique vantage point to combine with these other line—Of—sight measurements to obtain a

weather events. In particular, RAIDS is best suited to Viewing the 100—200 krn altitude region where inﬂuences
from below such as waves and tides mix with solar and geomagnetic drivers originating from above.

This paper describes the updated performance Characteristics of the four RAIDS sensors covering the extreme—
to near—ultraViolet wavelengths. In addition to updating the original papers describing these sensors,2’3 new
science objectives have been identiﬁed in line with the progress made in the intervening years that make the
renovated RAIDS experiment a compelling modern space weather sensor suite. This renovation also serves to
provide a unique perspective on the long—term stability for this Class of sensor, including components such as
the microchannel plate detectors, optics materials, and coatings. Another companion paper by Bishop et al.4 in
these proceedings describes the four Visible to near—infrared wavelength sensors and the related science goals. All
of the sensors will View in the anti—rarn direction, and all except the far—ultraviolet are contained on a scanning
platform that moves to allow the sensors to image a ﬁeld of regard up to 16 degrees in the vertical (altitude)
dimension. The far—ultraviolet sensor is an imager with a 4 degree ﬁeld of View in the vertical dimension that is
ﬁxed in position. The speciﬁcs for each instrument are reviewed below. Additional detail can be found in the
papers published as part of the original mission development?’3

2. EXTREME-ULTRAVIOLET SPECTROGRAPH
The RAIDS extreme—ultraviolet spectrograph (EUV) is an f/ 5 near—Wadsworth concave grating spectrograph.
The instrument rotates the grating between one of two positions to focus either the 55—85 nm or 77—110 nm
spectral range onto the detector. with a spectral resolution of 1.2 nm. The detector is comprised of three bare
microchannel plates stacked in a Z—shaped conﬁguration with a wedge—and—strip anode. The 2—dirnensional image
on the detector is summed in the cross—dispersion direction to provide an one—dimensional 128—pixel spectrum
every 0.5 s as the Viewing angle is Changed by the motion of the scan platform. A non—herrnetio plunger door
seals the detector compartment to prevent contamination prior to launch. This door opens with the ﬁrst motion
of the EUV grating motor and can only be Closed manually. In addition, a dust—cover over the telescope aperture
opens with the ﬁrst motion of the scan platform.
2.1 Instrument performance
A detailed calibration of the EUV instrument was done at the instrument level prior to the original integration
onto the RAIDS experiment.2 RAIDS was maintained under controlled environmental conditions in its assembled
conﬁguration with the dust and detector doors Closed during storage. These factors as well as the Visual and
electrical Checkout during the initial phases of the mission planning left the sensitivity of the instrument as the
primary performance metric that needed veriﬁcation. In order to maintain the mechanical integrity of the system,
the recalibration of the EUV was completed by operating the entire RAIDS experiment under vacuum at the
ultraviolet calibration facility in the Space Science Division of the Naval Research Laboratory. The remaining
speciﬁcs of the measurement were kept as identical as possible to the original calibration measurements. The
RAIDS experiment was positioned within the vacuum chamber with the EUV pointed at a diffusing screen that
was illuminated by a hollow—cathode gas discharge source and monochromator system. A Channeltron detector
with a mechanical collimator that was calibrated relative to NIST standards was used as the reference standard.
Background rates were low, generally less than 3 C / s. Relative sensitivities were obtained using emission features
of Ne (74.0 nm), oxgyen (83.4, 98.9 nrn),and argon (92.4, 104.8 and 106.6 nm). These were then sealed to an
absolute sensitivity measurement obtained using the argon 106.6 nm feature and replacing the monochromator
with a ﬁlter system to increase the signal for better statistical accuracy while still isolating the emission line.

Figure 1 shows the current measurements along with the calculated sensitivity expectations2 scaled by 0.9
for comparison. The plot shows only statistical uncertainties in the measurements. True uncertainties including
systematic error in these measurements are expected to be i20%, on par with the estimates from the original
measurement. The results show that despite the age of the EUV instrument and the differences in personnel
and setup for measuring the sensitivities, the shape of the responsivity curves are in good agreement with each
other. The new data also conﬁrm that the EUV instrument has lost only 10% of its sensitivity compared to the
original expectations.

Laboratory, compared to the original instrument—Ievel sensitivity measurements scaled by 0.9 (dashed line). The current
values reﬂect a relative sensitivity measured at each wavelength that is scaled to an absolute sensitivity measurement
using the argon emission line at 106.6 nm.
2.2 Measurement Goals and Applications
The primary goal of the RAIDS EUV sensor is to measure the emissions originating from 0+ in the ionosphere.
The primary and brightest target amongst these features is the OH 83.4 nm triplet. This emission originates
below 200 km primarily due to the photoionization and excitation of atomic O by solar extreme—ultraviolet ﬂux,
With a small contributions from photoelectron impact ionization of atomic oxygen and from resonant scattering
of the solar 83.4 nm emission. The Iine—center optical depth for this emission is on the order of 1 but nearing
values as high as 10 When the ionospheric peak density exceeds 1060m_3.5 Thus, as the initial source photons
transit through the ionosphere, multiple scattering causes the emission proﬁle to take on the Characteristics
of the ionospheric layer at higher altitudes. Interestingly, it is this moderate opacity that allows the emission
to allow the inference of ion density information Without being lost in the fog of an optically thick medium.
It should be noted that the overlap for the two wavelength ranges determined by the EUV grating position
allows the 83.4 nm emission to be measured regardless of the EUV conﬁguration. There have been several
early studies on the efﬁcacy of using the 83.4 nm airglow to determine ionospheric propertiesﬁ’7 and a small
number of measurements of this emission5 but several complications t0 the inversion problem have made this a
challenging airglow feature to interpret. RAIDS is designed to address the key challenges that limit our current
understanding of the fundamental processes that hinder this otherwise promising daytime ionospheric remote
sensing technique.

First, the RAIDS experiment Will provide measurements of the 61.7 nm emission to help constrain and specify
the magnitude of the initial excitation rate that illuminates the ionosphere from below. Currently this value
must be calculated based on thermospheric models in combination With solar ﬂux measurements or models.
This emission is optically thin to the ionosphere and thus provides a direct measure of the initial source region.
In combination With the 83.4 nm measurement, it provides a complementary pair of proﬁles to compare and
accurately model the multiple scattering process through the ionosphere, thereby obtaining a measure of the ion
density.

Second, the ISS orbits very near and occasionally below the peak of the ion density depending on location,
phase of the solar cycle, and other factors. In these scenarios, both emissions Will provide direct measures
of the initial source region. Thus, a comparison between the two Will provide an opportunity to evaluate the
fundamental cross—sections that are used to estimate the initial source. Currently these are obtained by laboratory
measurements but have not been tested in the space environment. In addition, the RAIDS experiment Will provide

"
"4","measurements of the neutral density (discussed in the following sections) that can be used in combination with
solar ﬂux measurements and these EUV proﬁles to obtain a self—consistent understanding of the excitation
mechanism that produces this measure of the daytime ionosphere.

Finally, the RAIDS EUV instrument will provide a set of proﬁles over a range of locations and conditions
against which to test and improve the daytime ionosphere retrieval algorithms. In addition to the improvements
in understanding the physics behind the problem, the number of quality measurements is limited to a few hundred
proﬁles. RAIDS will add to this data set. The parametric study of McCoy et al.6 identiﬁed the key variables
in understanding how Changes in the ionosphere could be derived from altitude proﬁles of the 83.4 nm emission.
Despite these seminal studies, the development of a true ionospheric remote sensing technique will beneﬁt greatly
from the data the RAIDS EUV instrument will provide.

3. FAR—ULTRAVIOLET SPECTROGRAPH
The RAIDS far—ultraviolet spectrograph (FUV) is an f/ 5 imaging Wadsworth spectrograph covering the wave—
length range 130—180 nm at 0.7 nm resolution. The telescope and 9.0mm >< 0.025mrn slit deﬁne the 4.0 X 0.1
degree ﬁeld of View. The two—dimensional detector provides 256 spectral pixels and 64 imaging (vertical) pixels.
The imaging pixels correspond to 2—3 krn altitude resolution for the proﬁle. Because the FUV instrument does
not scan the altitude proﬁle, the mounting feet were replaced to allow for the new orbital altitude. Discussion
of the rationale based on the expected science goals is presented below. The detector includes a stack of three
mioroohannel plates in a Z conﬁguration with a wedge—and—strip anode. The top plate is coated with a CsI
photocathode and the detector is sealed with a MgF2 window. In the normal RAIDS operating mode, the FUV
sensor is synchronized to produce one image for every cycle of the scan platform. One image in the memory
buffer is transmitted down in parts within the RAIDS data stream while the next image is compiled. The image
also uses one row for pulse height and photon processing error codes that aid in diagnosing sensor performance.
The image is only composed of photons that fall within preset pulse height limits (nominally 20—60% range), and
two redundant high—voltage power supplies can be adjusted to provide the appropriate gain as the sensor ages.
3.1 Instrument Performance
The FUV sensor performance was evaluated using the same facility and setup as was used for the EUV calibration.
Initial tests indicated a possible loss of sensitivity at short wavelengths. Based on these results, the FUV sensor
detector was removed to evaluate whether contamination on the detector window could be the cause. Extensive
isolated tests and inspections of the FUV detector failed to reveal any cause of the sensitivity loss, and the sensor
was reassembled and tested at the instrument level. The ﬁnal calibration was completed during the same test
run as the EUV calibration discussed in Section 2.1 prior to mechanically reintegrating the FUV into the RAIDS
package. The sensor was, however, electrically connected through the RAIDS system in the ﬂight conﬁguration.
The large ﬁeld of View of the FUV required a two—step calibration. First, the sensor measured the relative
intensity using the gas discharge source and monochromator at several wavelengths throughout the passband:
N2 (149.3,135.3, 138.3, and 167.4 nm), Xe (147.0 nm), and Hg (135.3, 143.6, 157.5, 160.8, and 167.4 nm). These
were compared to a reference detector with traceability back to NIST standards to provide a relative sensitivity
across the band. Then a direct lamp with a xenon gas source and a BaF2 ﬁlter was used to illuminate the
diffuser such that the ﬁeld of View was ﬁlled with monochromatic radiation at 147.0 nm. This measurement was
used to pin the relative sensitivity curve to an absolute scale, as was done for the EUV. The current sensitivity
measurement shown in Figure 2 conﬁrmed the loss of sensitivity shortward of 140 nm but demonstrated a strong
similarity to previous measurements at longer wavelengths. The implications are discussed in the next section.
3.2 Measurement Goals and Applications
The primary features that will be measured by the FUV spectrograph are the 01 emissions at 130.4 and 135.6 nm
and the N2 Lyman—Birge—Hopﬁeld (LBH) bands that exist across the passband. During the day time, these
features can be used to derive 0, N2, and 02 concentrations and therrnospheric temperature. The ﬁxed position
of the FUV and the small ﬁeld of View relative to the scan proﬁle of the other instruments required that the
Viewing angle be adjusted to capture the peak of the emission proﬁles of these emissions in order to maximize
the potential scientiﬁc return. Figure 3 shows a history of the altitude of the peak intensity of these emission

proﬁles as seen by the Global Ultraviolet Imager (GUVI) 0n the NASA Thermosphere Ionosphere Mesosphere
Energetics and Dynamics (TIMED) satellite. GUVI has obtained more than six years worth of proﬁles from an
orbital altitude of 550 km, slightly higher than RAIDS will be. However, TIMED/GUVI does have a similar
inclination that samples all local times and has measured across a range of solar and geomagnetic conditions,
and therefore is a good indicator of the proﬁles RAIDS will see. The LBH emissions from GUVI are split into
the short (1335—1377 nm) and long (1410—1530) wavelength channels and show different peak altitudes due to
higher absorption by 02 at shorter wavelengths. Dashed lines indicate the altitude range expected to be seen by
the RAIDS FUV sensor given nominal values for the ISS altitude of 380 km and pitch of —3.0 degrees as deﬁned
in the last panel. Uncertainty due to potential Changes to these parameters have been taken into account to
optimize the probability that these key emissions can be seen.

The loss of sensitivity at short wavelengths coupled with concerns about the ability to maintain coverage
of the key emission features has transitioned the FUV sensor and its measureables to a secondary objective in
RAIDS science goals. At night, the most prominent emission is the 0+ emission at 135.6 nm that is proportional
to the column—integrated square of the ion density. This emission is more than an order of magnitude dimmer
than its dayside counterpart, putting the ﬁdelity of these data products in doubt.

4. MIDDLE-ULTRAVIOLET SPECTROMETER

The RAIDS middle—ultraviolet spectrometer (MUV) is an f / 5 Ebert—Fastie monochromator that covers the wave—
length range 190—317 nm at 1 nm resolution. The detector is a CsTe2 photomultiplier with a MgF2 window.
A Si02 window at the entrance slit to the monochromator is used to eliminate shorter wavelengths in higher
orders. A stepper motor rotates the grating to scan the spectrometer, with a scan period of approximately 25 s.
The sampling rate is 40 Hz.

4.1 Instrument Performance

Calibration checks on the MUV were done in the laboratory using the tungsten quartZ—halogen FEL lamp as
used in the original calibration measurements. Although the lamp was procured from NIST, the calibration had
expired. Also, the calibration of the irradiance standard was valid only longward of 250 nm. However, the lamp
has been maintained without signiﬁcant use and thus was used to obtain a ﬁrst—order evaluation of the MUV
responsivity. We have made a comparison at shorter wavelengths with an uncalibrated deuterium lamp that was

measurements. Additional post—launch tests of the lamps and the BaSO4 diffusing screen are planned along With
the development of in—ﬂight calibration methods to resolve this discrepancy. Regardless, the MUV sensor is still
performing strongly despite the extended RAIDS storage time and is able to provide high—quality measurements
for the science goals targeted by this instrument.
4.2 Measurement Goals and Applications
The most prominent goal of the MUV instrument is to provide measurements of the density of NO and determine
how variability in local time can inﬂuence global thermospheric temperature. Primary measurements at 215 and
236.5 nm from 90—175 km Will provide NO density proﬁles that can be compared to the temperature proﬁles
measured by the RAIDS near—infrared sensor.4 The NO proﬁle can also be used to 100k for signatures of tides
in the lower thermosphere.8
RAIDS spectra have been simulated in Figure 5 based on data collected by the ISAAC instrument that was
ﬂown on the ARGOS satellite. The left two plots are data from ISAAC at 101 km. The top plot shows calibrated
intensities and an estimated solar Rayleigh scattering background While the bottom plot shows the difference
between these two, mostly consisting of emission from the NO gamma bands. The right two plots show this
same information as it Will be measured by RAIDS With its lower—resolution 0.95 nm passband. RAIDS Will still
resolve the NO gamma bands but the integrated g—factors that Will be used over the limited bandpass regions
need to be adjusted from ISAAC. This ﬁgure shows the capability to use the gamma (0,1) band to derive the NO
column abundance With agreement between ISAAC data and the RAIDS simulated data to Within a few tenths
of a percent.

Figure 6. RAIDS NUV sensitivity (red curve) compared to original measurement (black curve). The sensor has shown
little degradation over time and will be able to meet its original design performance goals.

The MUV sensor can also be used to explore new alternatives to thermospheric remote sensing, and composi—
tion and exospheric temperature in particular. The N11 214.3 nm emission and the 011 247.0 nm emission derive
from N2 and 0 respectively, and can be used to infer altitude proﬁles of thermospheric densities much like the
algorithm discussed for the FUV in Section 3.2.9 This is a Challenging measurement with a spectrometer because
the emissions must be scanned, but these measurements should be beneﬁcial to devising a follow—on experiment
to exploit this new capability in more detail. In addition, the scan range can be used to supplement the limited
FUV measurement and enhance the accuracy of the neutral composition measurement Via comparisons between
and combinations of the FUV and MUV measurements.

5. NEAR—ULTRAVIOLET SPECTROMETER
The near—ultraviolet spectrometer (NUV) is similar to the MUV in design. The passband covers 295—399 nm at
a resolution of 0.7 nm. Light outside the passband is restricted through the use of a colored glass ﬁlter mounted
at the entrance slit. The spectrum is scanned like the MUV by rotating the grating with a stepper motor. One
full wavelength scan requires 25 seconds.
5.1 Instrument Performance
The responsivity Check on the NUV used the same tungsten quartZ—halogen FEL lamp as was used for the MUV
as well as the instrument—level calibration for the original mission. The reﬂectivity of the diffusing screen was
assumed to be unchanged from the original measurement. In this scenario, the only differences between the
original and the current calibration Checks were the distances between the source, the diffusing screen, and the
RAIDS instrument. Using the new set—up, the sensitivity shown in Figure 6 was measured to be effectively
unchanged from the original calibration.
5.2 Measurement Goals and Applications
The primary use of the NUV will be to measure the N2 second positive system. Although this has interesting
secondary scientiﬁc importance on its own for monitoring photoelectron fluxes,10 the primary use will be to
remove the contribution of N2 in the band measured by the near—infrared sensor.4 The spectrum will also
contain the 01 297.2 nm emission that can be used to monitor atomic oxygen in the upper atmosphere.

The RAIDS experiment has been refurbished to provide new measurements of Changes in lower thermospheric
and ionospheric temperature and composition in response to space weather events. The ultraviolet portion of the
spectrum from 55—130 nm, measured by four of the RAIDS sensors, provide a variety of detailed measurements
of the ionospheric density proﬁle as well as thermospheric composition and exospheric temperature. These mea—
surements are necessary to distinguish the inﬂuence of solar and geomagnetic forcing from above and the tidal
and wave inﬂuences that propagate up from the lower atmosphere. In addition, comparisons between different
spectral features will enhance the current understanding of the physics behind these different emissions, high—
lighted by a unique perspective on the multiple scattering effects that inﬂuence the ionospheric EUV emissions.
The opportunity exists to also compare a variety of emissions that derive from photoelectron processes to those
that are excited directly by the solar ultraviolet and X—ray ﬂux in order to test current models as well as develop
new techniques for accurate speciﬁcation of thermospherio densities. The RAIDS experiment will also provide a
new measure of nitric oxide that can be used to evaluate its importance in global temperatures.

The RAIDS sensors have survived the unexpected long—duration storage period with remarkable success.
Although kept in a controlled environment, the sensors were not kept under purge. Nevertheless, the sensors
appear to have maintained a large fraction of their original sensitivity. The cause of the only exception, the loss
of sensitivity at the short—wavelength part of the FUV sensor, has not been identiﬁed. However, the detector
has been shown to be operating near its original level, so contamination of the optics is the likely reason for the
drop in sensitivity compared to the original measurements. For this reason, the FUV was also categorized as a
secondary sensor for the main science objectives of the new RAIDS mission. As a refurbished suite of sensors,
RAIDS will ﬁnally fulﬁll its original mission to contribute to space weather remote sensing, this time from the
International Space Station.
