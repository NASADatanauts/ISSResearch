experiments on Skylab 4 found that elevated levels of urinary and fecal
calcium excretion continued throughout the 84-day ﬂight.2’3 More recent
measurements from cosmonauts who lived on the MIR station for 4-14 A25 A25
months have shown that loss in bone mineral density (BMD) from the 520 E Em “
greater trochanter averaged 1.6% per month.4 Since upper-extremity 5,- — ii . -A-
