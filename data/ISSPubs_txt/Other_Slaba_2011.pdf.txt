Abstract
Measurements taken in Low Earth Orbit (LEO) onboard the International Space Station (ISS) and transit vehicles have been exten—
sively used to validate radiation transport models. Primarily, such comparisons were done by integrating measured data over mission or
trajectory segments so that individual comparisons to model results could be made. This approach has yielded considerable information
but is limited in its ability to rigorously quantify and differentiate speciﬁc model errors or uncertainties. Further, as exploration moves
beyond LEO and measured data become sparse, the uncertainty estimates derived from these validation cases will no longer be appli—
cable. Recent improvements in the underlying numerical methods used in HZETRN have resulted in signiﬁcant decreases in code run
time. Therefore, the large number of comparisons required to express error as a function of a physical quantity, like cutoff rigidity, are
now possible. Validation can be looked at in detail over any portion of a ﬂight trajectory (e.g. minute by minute) such that a statistically
signiﬁcant number of comparisons can be made. This more rigorous approach to code validation Will allow the errors caused by uncer—
tainties in the geometry models, environmental models, and nuclear physics models to be differentiated and quantiﬁed. It Will also give
much better guidance for future model development. More importantly, it Will allow a quantitative means of extrapolating uncertainties
in LEO to free space. In this work, measured data taken onboard the ISS during solar maximum are compared to results obtained With
the particle transport code HZETRN. Comparisons are made at a large number (~77,000) of discrete time intervals, allowing error esti—
mates to be given as a function of cutoff rigidity. It is shown that HZETRN systematically underestimates exposure quantities at high
cutoff rigidity. The errors are likely associated With increased angular variation in the geomagnetic ﬁeld near the equator, the lack of pion
production in HZETRN, and errors in high energy nuclear physics models, and Will be the focus of future work.

At the lowest cutoff rigidity value, the average error of all ﬁve

that may be contributing to the monotonic increase in error as space GCR environments can reach nearly 20% (Aghara et
