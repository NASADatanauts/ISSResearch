i We show that the dynamics of large fractal colloid aggregates are well described by a combination of
, l translational and rotational diffusion and internal elastic ﬂuctuations, allowing both the aggregate size
- and internal elasticity to be determined by dynamic light scattering. The comparison of results obtained
3 in microgravity and on Earth demonstrates that cluster growth is limited by gravity—induced restruc-
' turing. In the absence of gravity, thermal ﬂuctuations ultimately inhibit fractal growth and set the
. fundamental limitation to the lowest volume fraction which will gel.
