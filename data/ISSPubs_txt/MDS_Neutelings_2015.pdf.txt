AIMS: The Mice Drawer System (MDS) Tissue Sharing program was the longest rodent space mission ever performed. It provided 20

research teams with organs and tissues collected from mice having spent 3 months on the International Space Station (ISS). Our

participation to this experiment aimed at investigating the impact of such prolonged exposure to extreme space conditions on

mouse skin physiology.

METHODS: Mice were maintained in the MDS for 91 days aboard |SS (space group (5)). Skin specimens were collected shortly after

landing for morphometric, biochemical, and transcriptomic analyses. An exact replicate of the experiment in the MDS was

performed on ground (ground group (6)).

RESULTS: A signiﬁcant reduction of dermal thickness (—15%, P: 0.05) was observed in S mice accompanied by an increased new|y

synthetized procollagen (+42%, P=0.03), likely reﬂecting an increased collagen turnover. Transcriptomic data suggested that the

dermal atrophy might be related to an early degradation of defective newly formed procollagen molecules. Interestingly, numerous

hair follicles in growing anagen phase were observed in the three S mice, validated by a high expression of speciﬁc hair follicles

genes, while only one mouse in the G controls showed growing hairs. By microarray analysis of whole thickness skin, we observed a

signiﬁcant modulation of 434 genes in S versus G mice. A large proportion of the upregulated transcripts encoded proteins related

to striated muscle homeostasis.

CONCLUSIONS: These data suggest that a prolonged exposure to space conditions may induce skin atrophy, deregulate hair

follicle cycle, and markedly affect the transcriptomic repertoire of the cutaneous striated muscle panniculus carnosus.
