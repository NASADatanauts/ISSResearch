Abstract
The effect of the competition between convection and diffusion 0n the distribution of metal
halide additives in a high pressure mercury lamp has been examined by placing COST
reference lamps with mercury ﬁllings 0f 5 and 10 mg in a centrifuge. By subjecting them to
different accelerational conditions the convection speed of the mercury buffer gas is affected.
The resulting distribution of the additives, in this case dysprosium iodide, has been studied by
numerical simulations and measurements of the density of dysprosium atoms in the ground
state using imaging laser spectroscopy. The competition between aXial convection and radial
diffusion determines the degree of aXial segregation of the dysprosium additives.
