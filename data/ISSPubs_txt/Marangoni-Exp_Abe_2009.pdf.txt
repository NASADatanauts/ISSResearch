We focus on the dynamic particle accumulation structure (PAS) due to the thermocap-
illary effect in a half-zone liquid bridge. In this study, by tracking particles in the liquid
bridge and by measuring temperature on the free surface, we discuss the effects of a
liquid bridge shape described by its volume ratio upon the shape of the PAS itself and
motion of particle on the PAS. The variation of the liquid bridge volume ratio leads to
a signiﬁcant variation of the temperature gradient on the free surface, which results in
difference of the shape of the PAS, especially width of the PAS blade. By considering the
simply modeled particle motion, we explain that the width of the PAS blade is deter-
mined by several parameters, and we ﬁnd that its variation is explained mainly by a
drastic change of the axial velocity of the particle on the surface.
