Abstract

Pore-size expansion of hexagonal-struetured assembly of nanocrystalline titania
(anatase) combined with cetyltrimethyammonium bromide (CH3(CH2)15N+(CH3)3B{, CTAB)
(named as HeX-neTiOz/CTAB Nanoskeleton) was achieved with the aid of eosolvent organic
molecules (COMs). The pore-size expanded HeX-ncTiOz/CTAB Nanoskeleton was
prepared through the sol-gel reaction of titanium oxysulfate sulfuric acid hydrate
(TiOSO4’XstO4'XH20, TiOSAH) in an aqueous solution initiated by CTAB swollen
micelles pre-prepared with the addition of COMs into aqueous CTAB mieellar solutions at 60
°C (the product was named as HeX-neTiOz/CTAB/COM Nanoskeleton). Long-ehain alcohol
(1-hexadeean01, C16OH), normal alkane (n-decane, C10) and benzene derivatives (benzene,
Bz; 1,3,5-trimethylbenzene, TMB; 1,3,5-triethylbenzene, TEB; 1,3,5-triis0pr0pylbenzene,
TiPB) were used as COMs to evaluate the effects of COM solubilization site in CTAB
micelles and COM molecular size 011 the pore-size expansion of the
HeX-ncTiOz/CTAB/COM Nanoskeleton. We found that 1,3,5-trimethylbenzene (TMB) and
1,3,5-triethylbenzene (TEB) act as effective COMs for pore-size expansion of the
HeX-ncTiOz/CTAB/COM Nanoskeleton in aqueous media. Pore sizes (average diameters)
of the HeX-ncTiOz/CTAB/TMB Nanoskeleton and HeX-neTiOz/CTAB/TEB Nanoskeleton
weres enlarged up to 4.2 nm and 4.3 nm, respectively, while pore size (average diameter) of
the HeX-ncTiOz/CTAB Nanoskeleton prepared in the absence of any COMs was 2.9 nm.
We also revealed that thermal stability of the HeX-neTiOz/CTAB/TMB Nanoskeleton became
higher than that of HeX-ncTiOz/CTAB Nanoskeleton. The hexagonally pore-structure 0f the
HeX-ncTiOz/CTAB/TMB Nanoskeleton was retained up to 400 °C, while the hexagonally
pore-structure 0f the HeX-ncTiOz/CTAB Nanoskeleton was kept up to 300 °C.

1. Introduction

Mesostruetured crystalline (anatase) titania (TiOz) With large pores has attracted
signiﬁcant attention because of their potential applications such as large molecule separation,
catalysis, medical implants, shape-selective heterojunctions and dye-sensitized solar
eell.[1-22] Therefore, the development of simple and versatile methods for the fabrication
of large pore-sized mesostruetured crystalline titania is an important and challenging task.
[1-22] However, compared With the mesostruetured silica materials such as MCM-41
materials prepared With cetyltrimethyammonium bromide (CH3(CH2)15N+(CH3)3Br', CTAB)
and poly(ethylene oxide)-p01y(pr0pylene oxide)-p01y(ethylene oxide) block
copolymers,[23-29] the fabrication of large pore-sized mesostruetured crystalline titania is
still a big challenge because mesostrueture 0f titania materials generally collapses during the
crystallization by ealcination.[10-22] In addition, preparation of mesostruetured crystalline
titania typically requires alcohol-based s01vents,[10-22] so the replacement of many
conventional alcohols as solvents used in the sol-gel reaction to the environmental benign
alternatives is also an important challenge toward achieving the goal of green chemical
processing.

Then, we considered to apply a preparation method that we have recently
developed[30-33] t0 the fabrication of larger pore-sized mesostructured crystalline titania.
Our synthetic method enables to produce the hexagonal-struetured assembly of
nanocrystalline titania (anatase) combined With cetyltrimethyammonium bromide
(CH3(CH2)15N+(CH3)3Br', CTAB) (named as HeX-neTiOz/CTAB Nanoskeleton) through the
sol-gel reaction of titanium oxysulfate sulfuric acid hydrate (TiOSO4'XstO4’XH20,
TiOSAH) in an aqueous solution, Which is initiated by CTAB spherical micelles in the
absence of any other additives such as base and aeid.[30-33] Compared With the reported
methods,[10—21] our synthetic system involves beneﬁts, for example, spontaneous formation
of hexagonal structure and crystallization of titania (anatase formation) in aqueous solutions

under mild conditions (e.g., at 60 °C for 24 h) through the simple procedure (mixing of
aqueous solutions containing TiOSAH and CTAB but 110 other additives such as base and
acid as reaction initiators required, and 110 evaporation and ealcination processes required)
and water as a s01vent.[30-33] This matches with recent emerging environmental
requirements 011 nanomaterial synthetic strategy such as utilization of environmentally benign
solvents, a simplified procedure, minimized material use and low energy input. Therefore,
the fabrication of larger pore-sized HeX-ncTiOz/CTAB Nanoskeleton should provide further
opportunities for the applications of mesostruetured titania materials.

In this paper, we report the fabrication of larger pore-sized HeX-neTiOz/CTAB
Nanoskeleton using CTAB swollen micelles (that were prepared with the addition of
eosolvent organic molecules (COMs) into aqueous CTAB mieellar solutions) as templates
and structure-directing agents (the product was named as HeX-ncTiOz/CTAB/COM
Nanoskeleton) (see Figure 1). In particular, long-ehain alcohol (1-hexadeean01, C16OH),
normal alkane (n-deeane, C10), benzene derivatives (benzene, Bz; 1,3,5-trimethylbenzene,
TMB; 1,3,5-triethylbenzene, TEB; 1,3,S-triisopropylbenzene, TiPB) were selected as
COMs to investigate the effects of solubilization site of COMs in CTAB micelles and
molecular size of COM 0n the pore-size expansion of the HeX-neTiOz/CTAB/COM
Nanoskeleton.

2. Experimental
2.1. Preparation of Hex-ncTiOz/CTAB Nanoskeleton

HeX-ncTiOz/CTAB Nanoskeleton was prepared through the aging (sol-gel reaction)
at 60 °C for 24 h after mixing of aqueous solutions (18.2 m!) cm, Millipore-filtered water)
containing 3.0 mol L'1 titanium oxysulfate sulfuric acid hydrate (TiOSO4’XstO4'XH20;
TiOSAH, Aldrich) and 60 X 10'3 mol L'1 eetyltrimethylammonium bromide
(CH3(CH2)15N+(CH3)3Br'; CTAB, Aldrich) (following the procedure that we reported

previously).[30-33] The precipitate produced was ﬁltrated and washed by water, and ﬁnally,
powder of the HeX-neTiOz/CTAB Nanoskeleton was obtained after drying at 120 °C for 10 h
under air atmosphere.
2.2. Preparation of Hex-ncTiOz/CTAB/COM Nanoskeleton

HeX-ncTiOz/CTAB/COM Nanoskeleton was prepared by mixing of a 3.0 mol L'1
TiOSAH aqueous solution with the pre-prepared aqueous CTAB swollen mieeller solutions at
60 °C, and reacting at the same temperature for 24 h. The swollen CTAB micelles were
prepared by mixing of a eosolvent organic molecule (COM) with a 60 X 10'3 mol L'1 CTAB
aqueous solutions in the range of 0-28 mixing ratio (rCOM = COM / CTAB molar ratio) at 60
°C for 24 h. We selected l-hexadecanol (CH3(CH2)150H; C16OH, Tokyo Chemical
Industry C0., Ltd.), n-decane (CH3(CH2)8CH3; C10, Wako Pure Chemical Industries, Ltd.)
and 1,3,5-trimethylbenzene ((CH3)3C6H3; TMB, Tokyo Chemical Industry C0., Ltd.) as
COMs to evaluate the connection between solubilization site of COM in a CTAB mieelle and
pore size of the HeX-neTiOz/CTAB/COM Nanoskeleton formed, because 1-hexadecanol
(C16OH) molecules are solubilized between surfactant molecules, n-deeane (C10) molecules
are solubilized in the micelle core, and 1,3,5-trimethylbenzene (TMB) molecules are
solubilized in both micelle core and the vicinity of mieelle surface (hydrophilie cationic
region) due to an interaction between Tc-electron 0f TMB and cationic group of CTAB.[23-28,
34, 35] We also used benzene (C6H6; Bz, Tokyo Chemical Industry C0., Ltd.),
1,3,5-triethylbenzene ((C2H5)3C6H3; TEB, Tokyo Chemical Industry C0., Ltd.) and
1,3,5-triis0pr0pylbenzene ((C3H7)3C6H3; TiPB, Tokyo Chemical Industry C0., Ltd.) as COMs
to examine the relationship between molecular size of COM solubilized in CTAB micelles
and pore size of the HeX-neTiOz/CTAB/COM Nanoskeleton formed.
HeX-ncTiOz/CTAB/COM Nanoskeleton powder was ﬁnally obtained after same procedure
with HeX-ncTiOz/CTAB Nanoskeleton powder (see section 2.1).

2.3 Characterization

Mesostructure, crystal type and crystallinity of the HeX-ncTiOz/CTAB
Nanoskeleton and HeX-neTiOz/CTAB/COM Nanoskeleton thus prepared were characterized
using powder X-ray diffraction (XRD) (X’pert-MPD CuKoc radiation, Philips).
Mesostructure, pore size (diameter) and framework thickness of the HeX-ncTiOz/CTAB
Nanoskeleton and HeX-neTiOz/CTAB/COM Nanoskeleton were conﬁrmed by combination
of values of dIOO-spacing (distance between pores = pore diameter + framework thickness)
estimated from the position of the XRD peak assigned to (100) facet by Bragg’s equati0n[36]
and the direct observation using transmission electron microscopy (TEM) (H-7650, Hitachi
High Technology, 120 kV, 3,0 MA).

2.4 Thermal stability of the Hex-ncTiOz/CTAB Nanoskeleton and
Hex-ncTiOz/CTAB/COM Nanoskeleton

To assess the thermal stability of the HeX-ncTiOz/CTAB Nanoskeleton and
HeX-ncTiOz/CTAB/COM Nanoskeleton, the HeX-neTiOz/CTAB Nanoskeleton and
HeX-ncTiOz/CTAB/COM Nanoskeleton were calcined in air atmosphere at various
end-temperatures in the range of 150-450 °C. Each sample was calcined with a heating rate
of 1 °C min'1 starting from 25 °C and kept at the end-temperature for 2 h. Following
cooling down of the calcined samples to 25 °C, XRD 0f the calcined samples was measured
to conﬁrm the pore structure and crystal growth of the HeX-ncTiOz/CTAB Nanoskeleton and
HeX-ncTiOz/CTAB/COM Nanoskeleton. The end-temperature was each time increased
with 50 °C for each sample (see Figure 2).

The thermal behavior of the HeX-ncTiOz/CTAB Nanoskeleton and
HeX-ncTiOz/CTAB/COM Nanoskeleton was examined using the thermo gravimetry (TG) and
differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) (STA 449C/ 3/ G Jupiter, NETZSCH). Samples were

heated at a heating rate of 3 °C min'1 under a nitrogen atmosphere (ﬂow rate of 40 01113
min'l).
3. Results and Discussion
3.1 Hex-ncTiOz/CTAB Nanoskeleton

Let us first recall the hexagonal-struetured assembly of nanocrystalline titania
(anatase) combined with CTAB (named as HeX-neTiOz/CTAB Nanoskeleton) that we have
developed.[30-33] The HeX-ncTiOz/CTAB Nanoskeleton was prepared through the sol-gel
reaction of TiOSAH with CTAB spherical micelles in an aqueous solution at 60 °C for 24 h.
The formation process is as follows: hexagonal-struetured assembly of hydrated titania
(amorphous titania) formes immediately after mixing of TiOSAH and CTAB mieellar aqueous
solutions, and then the hydrated titania transforms into crystalline titania (anatase) through
polyeondensation with elapsed time at 60 °C for 24 h (details have been described in ref. [32]).
In a XRD pattern of the HeX-ncTiOz/CTAB Nanoskeleton thus formed, noticeable three peaks
assigned to hexagonally ordered structure (dioo : duo : dzoo = 1:1/x/3 :1/2)[32] were observed
in low-angle region (see upper panel of Figure 3). Also shown in Figure 3 (see bottom
panel) was a XRD pattern of the HeX-ncTiOz/CTAB Nanoskeleton observed in wide-angle
region, which was assigned to crystalline titania ((101) and (200) facets of anatase).[36, 37]
Additionally, honeycomb-like structure with the pore diameter of 2.9 nm (average diameter)
and framework (wall) thickness of 1.2 nm (average thickness) (see upper image of Figure 4)
and long-range lined structure (see bottom image of Figure 4) 0f the HeX-ncTiOz/CTAB
Nanoskeleton were observed by TEM. Sum of the pore diameter and framework thickness
was in good agreement with the value of dloo-spaeing (4.1 nm) (distance between pores =
pore diameter + framework thickness) estimated from the (100) peak of low-angle XRD (see
Table 1).

In order to evaluate the mechanism 011 the hydrolysis reaction of TiOSAH initiated by
CTAB and formation of hexagonal-struetured assembly mediated by CTAB, we have tested
various surfactants such as alkyltrimethylammonium bromides (CH3(CH2)n_1N+(CH3)3Br';
CnTAB, n = 12, 14, 16 and 18) and sodium dodecyl sulphate (CH3(CH2)HOSO3'Na+; SDS),
polyeleetrolytes such as poly(allylamine hydrochloride) ([CHzCH(CH2NH2)HCl]n; PAH) and
poly(sodium 4-styrenesulf0nate, [C8H7SO3Na]n; P888) and formamide (HCONHz) in
previous work.[32] We have revealed that CnTAB (n = 12, 14, 16 and 18) mediated the
formation of HeX-neTiO2/CnTAB Nanoskeleton. P01y(ally1amine hydrochloride) (PAH)
and formamide also initiated the hydrolysis reaction of TiOSAH but did not mediate the
formation of hexagonal-struetured assembly. 011 the other hand, anionic system such as
SDS and P888 did not initiate the hydrolysis reaction of TiOSAH and did not produce titania.
These ﬁndings suggest that nitrogens, amino groups and/or quaternary ammonium ions in the
molecules and polymers act as catalysts and/or reactants to initiate the hydrolysis reaction of
TiOSAH in aqueous solutions. Moreover, surfactant (CnTAB) micelles are required for the
formation of hexagonal-struetured assembly.

3.2 Hex-ncTiOz/CTAB/COM Nanoskeleton prepared using l-hexadecanol (C16OH),
n-decane (C10) and 1,3,5-trimethylbenzene (TMB)

It is reported that 1,3,5-trimethylbenzene (TMB) acts as an appropriate eosolvent
organic molecule (COM) for pore-size enlargement of the mesostructured silica materials.
[23-28] This is due to the solubilization site of TMB in CTAB micelles (both mieelle core
and ionic outer layer (hydrophilic cationic region) caused by an interaction between Tc-eleetron
0f TMB and cationic group of CTAB) and the resulting large amount of TMB solubilizing
into CTAB micelles.[23-28] Then, we examined the connection between pore size of
HeX-ncTiOz/CTAB/COM Nanoskeleton formed and solubilisation site of COM in CTAB
micelles. In order to evaluate the connection between pore size of

8

"
"10","COLSUA-D-10-00611 Revised August 2010

HeX-ncTiOg/CTAB/COM Nanoskeleton formed and solubilisation site of COMs in CTAB
micelles, we used 1-hexadeean01 (C16OH), n-decane (C10) and 1,3,5-trimethylbenzene
(TMB) as COMs because C16OH molecules are solubilized between CTAB molecules, C10
molecules are solubilised in hydrophobic mieelle core, and TMB molecules are solubilised in
both hydrophobic micelle core and ionic outer layer of CTAB mieelles.[23-28, 34, 35]

In the utilization of 1-hexadeean01 (C16OH) as a COM, HeX-neTiOz/CTAB/C16OH
Nanoskeleton was prepared in the rc160H range of 0-1 (see Figure 5). Low-angle XRD
observed noticeable three peaks corresponding to (100), (110) and (200) facets or a peak
corresponding to (100) facet of the hexagonally ordered structure in the rc160H range of 0-1
(see upper panel of Figure 5). Wide-angle XRD patterns also shown in Figure 5 (see bottom
panel) indicate that the HeX-ncTiOz/CTAB/C16OH Nanoskeleton formed is composed of
anatase.[36, 37] N0 noticeable peak was observed in low-angle XRD above rc160H 0f 1.
Pore-size change of the HeX-ncTiOz/CTAB/C16OH Nanoskeleton was discussed in terms of
the shift of the peak assigned to (100) facet in low-angle XRD (see upper panel of Figure 5)
and the change in the dloo-spacing (distance between pores) estimated. The peak
corresponding to (100) facet of the HeX-ncTiOz/CTAB/C16OH Nanoskeleton was shifted to
lower angle with increase of C16OH content in CTAB mieellar solutions (see upper panel of
Figure 5). Namely, dloo-spaeing (distance between pores) of the HeX-neTiOz/CTAB/C16OH
Nanoskeleton formed increased with increase of C16OH content in CTAB mieellar solutions.
Maximum dmO-spaeing 0f the HCX-IICTioz/CTAB/C16OH Nanoskeleton estimated by Bragg’s
equation was 4.9 nm at rc160H 0f 1 (see Figure 8).

For n-decane (C10) as a COM, formation of HeX-neTiOz/CTAB/CIO Nanoskeleton
was conﬁrmed in the rcm range of 0-20 (see Figure 6). Three peaks assigned to (100), (110)
and (200) facets of hexagonally ordered structure became broader, and the peak corresponding
to (100) facet of the HeX-ncTiOz/CTAB/Clo Nanoskeleton was shifted to lower angle with
increase of C10 content in CTAB mieellar aqueous solutions up to rcm 0f 6 (see upper panel of

9

"
"11","COLSUA-D-10-00611 Revised August 2010
Figure 6). Above rem 0f 6, position of the peak corresponding to (100) facet of the
HeX-ncTiOz/CTAB/CIO Nanoskeleton remained unchanged up to rcm 0f 20 (see upper panel
of Figure 6). So maximum dloo-spaeing 0f the HeX-neTiOz/CTAB/CIO Nanoskeleton
estimated was 5.8 nm (see Figure 8). Anatase formation of the HeX-ncTiOz/CTAB/CIO
Nanoskeleton was conﬁrmed by wide-angle XRD patterns (see bottom panel of Figure 6).[36,
37]

In the case of 1,3,5 -trirnethy1benzene (TMB), noticeable three peaks corresponding to
(100), (110) and (200) facets or a peak corresponding to (100) facet of the hexagonally
ordered structure in HeX-neTiOz/CTAB/TMB Nanoskeleton were observed in the rTMB range
of 0-20 (see upper panel of Figure 7). Wide-angle XRD patterns also shown in Figure 7 (see
bottom panel) conﬁrmed that the HeX-neTiO2/CTAB/TMB Nanoskeleton formed consisted of
anatase.[36, 37] The three peaks corresponding to (100), (110) and (200) facets of the
hexagonally ordered structure observed in HeX-neTiO2/CTAB/TMB Nanoskeleton became
broader with increase of TMB content while the peak position remained unchanged up to
rTMB 0f 8 (see upper panel of Figure 7). The peak corresponding to (100) facet of the
HeX-neTiO2/CTAB/TMB Nanoskeleton was shifted to lower angle with increase of TMB
content in CTAB mieellar solutions above rTMB 0f 8, and reached lowest angle at rTMB 0f 16
(see upper panel of Figure 7). The dloo-spacings 0f the HeX-ncTiO2/CTAB/TMB
Nanoskeleton were also plotted in Figure 8 as a function of TMB/CTAB molar ratio. The
maximum dmO-spaeing 0f the HeX-neTiO2/CTAB/TMB Nanoskeleton formed was 6.8 nm at
rTMB 0f 16 (see Figure 8). TEM observation of the HeX-neTiO2/CTAB/TMB Nanoskeleton
formed at rTMB 0f 16 revealed the honeycomb-like structure with the average pore diameter of
4.2 nm and average framework thickness of 2.7 nm (see upper image in Figure 9) and
long-range lined structure (see bottom image of Figure 9). Sum of the pore diameter (4.2
nm) and framework thickness (2.7 nm) were consistent with maximum dmO-spacing (6.8 nm)

10

"
"12","COLSUA-D-10-00611 Revised August 2010
observed at rTMB of 16 which corresponds to the distance between pores containing pore
diameter and framework thickness (see Table 1).

Let us see again the dIOO-spaoings of HeX-noTiOz/CTAB/COM Nanoskeleton plotted
as a function of COM/CTAB molar ratio (rCOM) summarized in Figure 8. In all COMs,
pore sizes of the HeX-noTiOz/CTAB/COM Nanoskeleton became larger than that of the
HeX-noTiOz/CTAB Nanoskeleton. In particular, TMB worked effectively for the pore-size
expansion of HeX-noTiOz/CTAB/COM Nanoskeleton (see Figure 8). This is most likely
related to the size (diamater) of COM-solubilized CTAB swollen micelles depending on the
solubilizatin site of COMs in the CTAB micelles. Since l-hexadeoanol (C16OH) molecules
are solubilized between surfactant molecules, the size of surfactant micelles typically does not
increase significantly.[23-28, 34, 35] On the other hand, n-deoane (C10) molecules
solubilized in the micelle core encourage the size increase of micelles more than
C16OH.[23-28, 34, 35] Consequently, the pore size of the HeX-noTiOz/CTAB/CIO
Nanoskeleton would be larger than that of HeX-noTiOz/CTAB/C16OH Nanoskeleton. In the
case of 1,3,5-trimethylbenzene (TMB) molecules, the size of TMB-solubilized CTAB
swollen micelles would be larger than that of ClO-solubilized CTAB swollen micelles
because TMB molecules are solubilized in both mioelle core and the Vicinity of mioelle surface
(hydrophilio cationic region) due to an interaction between Tc-eleotron of TMB and cationic
group of CTAB.[23-28, 34, 35] Hence, the pore size of the HeX-noTiO2/CTAB/TMB
Nanoskeleton would be larger than that of HeX-noTiOz/CTAB/CIO Nanoskeleton. We also
noticed the broadening and disappearing of the XRD peak corresponding to (100) facet of
hexagonally pore-struoture with increase of COMs added into CTAB mioellar solutions (see
Figures 5, 6 and 7), and the resulting limitation of the pore-size (dIOO-spaoing) expanded in
the HeX-noTiOz/CTAB/COM Nanoskeleton (see Figure 8). The dIOO-speoings of
HeX-noTiOz/CTAB/C16OH Nanoskeleton, HeX-noTiOz/CTAB/CIO Nanoskeleton and
HeX-noTiO2/CTAB/TMB Nanoskeleton were enlarged up to 4.9 nm (FC160H = 1), 5.8 nm(rc10

11

"13","COLSUA-D-10-00611 Revised August 2010
2 6) and 6.8 nm (rTMB = 16), respectively (see Figure 8). Namely, the addition of excess
COMs into CTAB mioellar solutions prevents the formation of HeX-noTiO2/CTAB/COM
Nanoskeleton. We speculate that the COM-solubilized CTAB swollen micelles would be a
main contributor to the formation of HeX-noTiO2/CTAB/COM Nanoskeleton while
CTAB-stabilized COM-in-water emulsions would be minor. Thus,
HeX-noTiOz/CTAB/COM Nanoskeleton would not be formed at higher content of COM in
CTAB mioellar solutions because CTAB-stabilized COM-in-water emulsions are a major
component in the solution.
3.3 Thermal stability of HeX-ncTiOZ/CTAB Nanoskeleton and
Hex-ncTiOz/CTAB/COMS Nanoskeleton

We now realized that the addition of COM into aqueous CTAB mioellar solutions
enabled to expand pore-size of HeX-noTiO2/CTAB Nanoskeleton. In particular, TMB was
the most effective in COMs that we examined for pore-size expansion of the
HeX-noTiOz/CTAB Nanoskeleton (see Figure 8). So next, we examined the thermal
stability of the HeX-noTiOz/CTAB Nanoskeleton and HeX-noTiOz/CTAB/COM Nanoskeleton.
Typically, the ordered pore-struoture of mesostruotured titania materials collapses during the
oaloination due to the orystallization.[10-22]. Therefore, thermal stability of the
mesostruotured titania materials is one of the important issues to be addressed.

In the case of HeX-noTiO2/CTAB Nanoskeleton, the XRD peak corresponding to
(100) facet of hexagonally pore-struoture was observed up to 300 °C while the XRD peak
became broader with higher temperature (see Figure 10a). This means that the hexagonally
pore-struoture of HeX-noTiO2/CTAB Nanoskeleton remains up to 300 °C. The position of
the XRD peak corresponding to (100) facet of hexagonally pore-struoture was shifted to
higher angle with thermal treatment (see Figure 10a), indicating that the dIOO-spaoing (pore
size) of the HeX-noTiO2/CTAB Nanoskeleton decreased during heating treatment. Namely,

12

"
"14","COLSUA-D-10-00611 Revised August 2010

HeX-ncTiOz/CTAB Nanoskeleton shrank during thermal treatment. The XRD peak
corresponding to (100) facet of HeX-ncTiOz/CTAB/C16OH Nanoskeleton was observed up to
200 °C with broadening, and the position of the XRD peak corresponding to (100) facet of
the hexagonally pore-structure was shifted to higher angle with temperature elevation (see
Figure 10b). The shifted peak position was close to that of HeX-ncTiOz/CTAB
Nanoskeleton. This indicates that pores shrink during thermal treatment. These findings
indicate that thermal stability of the HeX-ncTiOz/CTAB/C16OH Nanoskeleton was lower
than that of HeX-ncTiOz/CTAB Nanoskeleton. On the other hand, thermal stability of the
HeX-ncTiOz/CTAB/CIO Nanoskeleton and HeX-neTiO2/CTAB/TMB Nanoskeleton became
higher than that of HeX-ncTiOz/CTAB Nanoskeleton. The XRD peak corresponding to
(100) facet of hexagonally pore-structure was observed up to 400 °C with broadening with
temperature elevation in the case of the HeX-ncTiOz/CTAB/CIO Nanoskeleton and
HeX-ncTiO2/CTAB/TMB Nanoskeleton (see Figure 10c & d). No significant shift of the
(100) peak position was observed by heating (see Figure 10c & d). This indicates no
signiﬁcant shrinkage of HeX-ncTiOz/CTAB/CIO Nanoskeleton and HeX-neTiOz/CTAB/TMB
Nanoskeleton during thermal treatment. The highest temperatures that the XRD peak
corresponding to (100) facet of hexagonally structure was observed were summarized in
Table 2.

The different thermal stability between HeX-ncTiOz/CTAB Nanoskeleton,
HeX-ncTiOz/CTAB/C16OH Nanoskeleton, HeX-neTiOz/CTAB/CIO Nanoskeleton and
HeX-ncTiO2/CTAB/TMB Nanoskeleton that we observed is most likely attributed to the
amount of residual water, CTAB and COM in the HeX-ncTiOz/CTAB Nanoskeleton and
HeX-ncTiOz/CTAB/COM Nanoskeleton. Weight losses of the HeX-neTiOz/CTAB
Nanoskeleton, HCX-IICTi02/CTAB/C16OH Nanoskeleton, H6X-IlCTiOz/CTAB/C10
Nanoskeleton and HeX-ncTiO2/CTAB/TMB Nanoskeleton during thermal treatment up to
600 °C measured by TG were ~55%, ~53% ~35% and ~31%, respectively (see Figure 11),

which were consistent with the thermal stability of the HeX-ncTiOz/CTAB Nanoskeleton
and HeX-ncTiOz/CTAB/COM Nanoskeleton. Removal (decomposition) of the residual
water, CTAB and COM would lead to collapsing the hexagonally pore-structure 0f
HeX-ncTiOz/CTAB Nanoskeleton and HeX-neTiOz/CTAB/COM Nanoskeleton. In
particular, the amount of residual CTAB seems to affect signiﬁcantly the thermal stability of
HeX-ncTiOz/CTAB Nanoskeleton and HeX-neTiO2/CTAB/COM Nanoskeleton. A
exothermic process and weight loss attributing t0 the CTAB decomposition were observed in
the temperature range of 200-350 °C in the HeX-neTiOz/CTAB Nanoskeleton and
HeX-ncTiOz/CTAB/C16OH Nanoskeleton (see Figure 11a and b), while the process and
weight loss were not observed in the case of HeX-ncTiOz/CTAB/CIO Nanoskeleton and
HeX-neTiO2/CTAB/TMB Nanoskeleton (see Figure 11c and d). This suggests that CTAB
inside pores of the HeX-ncTiOz/CTAB/CIO Nanoskeleton and HeX-neTiO2/CTAB/TMB
Nanoskeleton is removed during washing and drying processes. Namely, C10 and TMB
help to remove CTAB inside pores. Also removal rate of the residual water, CTAB and
COM in HeX-neTiOz/CTAB Nanoskeleton and HeX-neTiOz/CTAB/COM Nanoskeleton
should be related to the thermal stability of HeX-ncTiO2/CTAB Nanoskeleton and
HeX-ncTiOz/CTAB/COM Nanoskeleton. For example, the different thermal stability
between HeX-neTiO2/CTAB Nanoskeleton and HeX-neTiOz/CTAB/C16OH Nanoskeleton
could be explained in terms of the removal rate of residual water, CTAB and COM in
HeX-ncTiOz/CTAB Nanoskeleton and HeX-neTiOz/CTAB/C16OH Nanoskeleton (see Figure
11a and b). Weight loss of the HeX-neTiO2/CTAB Nanoskeleton occurred gradually from
~220 °C to 600 °C, while weight loss of the HeX-neTiOz/CTAB/C16OH Nanoskeleton
occurred dramatically from ~220 °C to 400 °C. This would be a reason why thermal
stability of the HeX-neTiOz/CTAB/C16OH Nanoskeleton was lower than that of
HeX-ncTiOz/CTAB Nanoskeleton.

Overall, the thermal stability of H6X-ﬂCTiOz/CTAB Nanoskeleton and
HeX-ncTiOz/CTAB/COM Nanoskeleton that we prepared were relatively high compared to
the mesostruetured titania materials reported.[10-22] This is most likely due to the
non-erystallization and —erystal growth of the HeX-ncTiO2/CTAB Nanoskeleton and
HeX-ncTiOz/CTAB/COM Nanoskeleton during thermal treatment. Wide-angle XRD
patterns of HeX-ncTiOz/CTAB Nanoskeleton and HeX-neTiO2/CTAB/COM Nanoskeleton
hardly changed in the temperature range of 150-450 °C (see Figure 12). Framework of the
HeX-ncTiOz/CTAB Nanoskeleton and HeX-neTiO2/CTAB/COM Nanoskeleton was
crystallized during preparation process so that the framework would not be crystallized by
calcination.
3.4 Hex-ncTiOz/CTAB/COM Nanoskeleton prepared using benzene (Bz),
1,3,5-triethylbenzene (TEB) and 1,3,5-triis0pr0pylbenzene (TiPB)

As mentioned in the sections 3.2 and 3.3, we found that TMB acts as an effective
COM for pore-size expansion of the HeX-neTiO2/CTAB/COM Nanoskeleton (see Figure 8)
and enhances the thermal stability of the HeX-ncTiOz/CTAB/COM Nanoskeleton (see Figure
10 and Table 2). Then, we next examined benzene derivatives such as benzene (Bz),
1,3,5-triethylbenzene (TEB) and 1,3,5-triis0pr0pylbenzene (TiPB) as COMs to obtain better
insight on the COMs for pore-size expansion of the HeX-neTiOz/CTAB/COM Nanoskeleton.
These COMs allow us to evaluate the effect of molecular size of benzene derivative 0n the
pore size of HeX-neTiOz/CTAB/COM Nanoskeleton formed.

In the case of benzene (Bz) that is smaller molecule than TMB molecule, no
signiﬁcant effect of benzene 0n the pore-size expansion of HeX-ncTiOz/CTAB/Bz
Nanoskeleton was observed (see Figure 13). On the other hand, in the case of
1,3,5-triethylbenzene (TEB) that is larger molecule than TMB molecule, the maximum value
of dloo-spacing estimated from the peak corresponding to (100) facet of

15

"
"17","COLSUA-D-10-00611 Revised August 2010
HeX-ncTiOz/CTAB/TEB Nanoskeleton reached to 7.3 nm at rTEB 0f 12 (see Figure 13).
Average pore diameter and average framework thickness of HeX-ncTiOz/CTAB/TEB
Nanoskeleton observed by TEM were 4.3 nm and 2.9 nm (see Figure 14), which was
consistent with the value of dmO-spaeing (7.3 nm) (distance between pores = pore diameter +
framework thickness) estimated from low-angle XRD (see Table 1). Namely, pore size of
the HeX-ncTiOz/CTAB/TEB Nanoskeleton became larger than that of
HeX-neTiO2/CTAB/TMB Nanoskeleton. However, in the case of TiPB which is largest
molecule that we applied in this experiment, the maximum value of the dloo-spacing 0f
HeX-ncTiOz/CTAB/TiPB Nanoskeleton was 6.0 nm at mm of 2. These indicate that there is
an appropriate molecular size for pore-size expansion of HeX-neTiO2/CTAB/COM
Nanoskeleton. This is most likely related to the competition between TC-TC stacking of
benzene derivatives in a CTAB mieelle and their steric hindrance depending on molecular
size. Here we also observed the limited pore-size (dmO-spacing) expansion of
HeX-ncTiOz/CTAB/COM Nanoskeleton (see Figure 13). As discussed in section 3.2, this is
most likely due to the contribution of CTAB-stabilized COM-in-water emulsions.
4. Conclusions

We examined the pore-size expansion of hexagonal-struetured assembly of
nanoerystalline titania (anatase) combined with CTAB (HeX-neTiOz/CTAB Nanoskeleton)
using eosolvent organic molecules (COMs). In particular, the effects of COM solubilization
site in a CTAB micelles and COM molecular size 011 the pore-size expansion of the
HeX-ncTiOz/CTAB/COM Nanoskeleton were examined using various COMs such as
1-hexadecan01 (C16OH), n-decane (C10), benzene (Bz), 1,3,5-trimethylbenzene (TMB),
1,3,5-triethylbenzene (TEB) and 1,3,5-triis0pr0pylbenzene (TiPB). We revealed that every
COMs that we examined in this work aided to enlarge pore size of the
HeX-ncTiOz/CTAB/COM Nanoskeleton, while pore diameter of the HeX-neTiOz/CTAB

16

"18","COLSUA-D-10-00611 Revised August 2010

Nanoskeleton was 2.9 nm (the maximum dloo-spaeing (distance between pores) of 4.1 nm).
Especially, TMB and TEB acted as effective COMs for pore-size expansion of
HeX-ncTiOz/CTAB/COM Nanoskeleton. The maximum pore diameters observed by TEM
(maximum dIOO-spacing estimated from XRD) 0f the HeX-ncTiO2/CTAB/TMB Nanoskeleton
HeX-ncTiOz/CTAB/TEB Nanoskeleton were 4.2 nm (6.8 nm) and 4.3 nm (7.3 nm),
respectively. Furthermore, we revealed that thermal stability of the
HeX-ncTiO2/CTAB/TMB Nanoskeleton became higher than that of HeX-neTiOz/CTAB
Nanoskeleton.

We believe that our ﬁndings reported here provide better insight on the pore-size
expansion of mesostructured titania materials using cosolvent organic molecules (COMs) and
the thermal stability of the mesostructured titania materials. Solubilization site of COM in a
surfactant micelle and the resulting amount of COM solubilizing into surfactant micelles are
related to the interaction between COM and surfactant, molecular size and geometrical
structure. Thus, judicious selection of inorganic precursors, cosolvent organic molecules and
amphiphilic molecules as templates and/or structure-directing agents should enable to tune the
ordered pore-strueture, pore size and thermal stability of mesostructured titania materials.
