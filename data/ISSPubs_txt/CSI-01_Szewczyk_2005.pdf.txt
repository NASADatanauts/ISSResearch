ABSTRACT
The nematode Caenorhabditis elegans, a popular organism for biological studies, is being de-
veloped as a model system for space biology. The chemically defined liquid medium, C. el-
egans Maintenance Medium (CeMM), allows axenic cultivation and automation of experi-
ments that are critical for spaceflight research. To validate CeMM for use during spaceflight,
we grew animals using CeMM and standard laboratory conditions onboard STS-107, space
shuttle Columbia. Tragically, the Columbia was destroyed while reentering the Earth’s at-
mosphere. During the massive recovery effort, hardware that contained our experiment was
found. Live animals were observed in four of the five recovered canisters, which had sur-
vived on both types of media. These data demonstrate that CeMM is capable of supporting
C. elegans during spaceflight. They also demonstrate that animals can survive a relatively
unprotected reentry into the Earth’s atmosphere, which has implications with regard to the
packaging of living material during space flight, planetary protection, and the interplanetary
transfer of life. Key Words: Caenorhabditis elegans—Nematode—Spaceﬂight research—

canister 1 is shown on the right. Note the ablation of anodization and Visible pitting on the exterior of the canister.
Damage occurred principally on the side, with some also present on the lid and bottom. Scorching is evident in the
area surrounding where the Kapton label had been, though the tape label remained intact. b: Flown canister 1 is
shown along with all Teflon bumpers and Petri dishes. This photograph was taken immediately after the canister was
opened while disassembling the contents for further analysis. The temperature logger is out of the field of View.
Melted plastic from the temperature logger housing is Visible inside the canister. Partial melting and scorching of the
middle Teflon bumper are evident, with scorch marks on the side in contact with the canister wall at locations cor-
responding to points of Petri dish contact on the opposite side of the bumper. Scorching of the NomeX/nylon Velcro
strap is evident in the upper right corner of the stack. The discoloration inside Petri dishes is not burnt agar; rather
it is the result of mold growth on the CeMM plates. c: Flown autonomous temperature loggers. All show melting of
the plastic housing in points that were in direct contact with canister lids. The logger on the left is from canister 5,
the middle from canister 1, and the right from canister 2. d: Flown canister 2 is shown with all Teflon bumpers and
Petri dishes. This photograph was taken immediately after the canister was opened while disassembling the contents
for further analysis. The temperature logger is out of the field of View. Dishes were unstrapped to allow examination
of the Petri dish containing lithium hydroxide, shown in front of canister. Note the ablation of anodization and Vis-
ible pitting on the exterior of the canister. Damage is noted to be fairly uniform around the canister and to a lesser
extent than of some canisters. Scorching is evident in the area surrounding where the Kapton label had been, and
portions are retained. The paper on the canister is a label applied during recovery efforts. Partial melting of the Teflon
bumpers is evidenced by compression of the middle and right bumpers. Scorching of the NomeX/nylon Velcro strap
is evident in the upper right corner of the strap. The Petri dish containing lithium hydroxide is melted at the point
of NomeX/nylon Velcro strap contact, with some melted strap present. The bottom-most Petri dish is also partly
melted. e: Flown canister 3 is shown with all Teflon bumpers and Petri dishes. This photograph was taken immedi-
ately after the canister was opened while disassembling the contents for further analysis. Note the ablation of an-
odization and Visible pitting on the exterior of the canister. Damage is noted to be principally on the side displayed
and top of the canister. A larger impact than on some canisters was noted on the top of this canister. The paper on
the canister is a label applied during recovery efforts. Partial melting of the Teflon bumpers is evidenced by com-
pression of the middle and especially the right bumper. Scorching of the NomeX/nylon Velcro strap is evident in the
bottom-right corner of the strap. The top two Petri dishes are partly melted, and the top one is cracked. f: Flown can-
ister 4 is shown with all Teflon bumpers and Petri dishes. This photograph was taken immediately after the canister
was opened while disassembling the contents for further analysis. Note the ablation of anodization and Visible pit-
ting on the exterior of the canister. Damage is noted to be fairly uniform around the canister and to a larger extent
than on other canisters. Larger impacts than on some other canisters were noted on the bottom. Scorching is evident
in the area surrounding where the Kapton label and paper tape label had been, and portions of both are retained.
Partial melting of the Teflon bumpers is evidenced by compression of the middle and the right bumper. Scorching
and partial melting of the NomeX/nylon Velcro strap are evident on the top and side of the strap, respectively. The
Petri dish containing lithium hydroxide, shown in front of the stack, is melted at points of canister contact, with plas-
tic retained on the inside of the canister lid. The top three and second from bottom Petri dishes in the stack are partly
melted. g: Flown canister 5 is shown with all Teflon bumpers and Petri dishes. The temperature logger is out of the
field of View. This photograph was taken immediately after the canister was opened while disassembling the con-
tents for further analysis. Note the ablation of anodization and Visible pitting on the exterior of the canister. Melted
plastic from the temperature logger housing is Visible inside the canister. Partial melting of the Teflon bumpers is eV-
idenced by compression of the middle bumper. Scorching and partial melting of the NomeX/nylon Velcro strap are
evident on the top the strap. The top and bottom two Petri dishes in the stack are partly melted, and the bottom Petri
dish is cracked, as evidenced by the obvious lean of the stack of dishes.
