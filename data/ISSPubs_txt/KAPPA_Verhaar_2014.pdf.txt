peppe|enbosch@ transduction provoked by lipopolysaccharide (LPS) stimulation was investigated in freshly isolated
emsmusmcﬂl) peripheral blood monocytes and was compared to samples obtained from on-board centrifuge-loaded 1 g
controls. The effect of microgravity on immunological signal transduction is highly specific, since LPS
dependent Iun-N-terminal kinase activation is impaired in the 0 g condition, while the corresponding LPS
dependent activation of p38 MAP kinase remains unaffected. Thus our results identify Iun-N-terminal
kinase as a relevant target in immunity for microgravity and support using Iun-N-terminal kinase speciﬁc
inhibitors for combating autoimmune disease.
he constant threat of pathogenic organisms and the resulting evolutionary pressure to develop defences
against these challenges, has resulted in an array of collaborative defensive cell systems. These consist,
amongst others, of phagocytes and adaptive B and T cell systems which are collectively grouped under
the broad denominator immunity. The human immune system, like all cell biological systems in our body, has
developed in the continuous presence of the earth’s gravitational field. Thus it is conceivable that acute absence of
this external force, as occurs during space ﬂight, would inﬂuence functionality in this system. Indeed since the
early days of space exploration it has been evident that extra-atmospheric primates and humans experience
reduced immune function“. Certainly, some of the observed effects on immune function can be related to
environmental factors such as cosmic radiation5 and magnetic ﬁelds6. Furthermore, psychological factors such as
stress and anxiety7 from living and working in a conﬁned space, under cramped conditions and with inadequate
lifestyle, nutritional regimen and disturbance of circadian rhythmg’9 may affect the immune system. Nevertheless,
there are good reasons to believe that the weightlessness itself negatively inﬂuences immunocompetence 0f the
human body10‘13. Experimentation with crew members of space ﬂights showed reduced anti-Viral immunity15 and
a landmark experiment conducted in Spacelab 1 in 1983 demonstrated a near total absence of activation of
peripheral blood leukocytes upon exposure to concanavalin A (Con-A) when compared to identical ground
controls“. The mechanistic basis of this effect however, remains largely obscure. A recent study employing DNA
array analysis of Con-A and anti-CDZS-stimulated T cells, on board of the international space station, showed
that microgravity-exposed T cells were deficient in transcription of immediate early genes associated with the
tumour necrosis factor alpha pathway. However, T cells stimulated in an on-board centrifuge, artificially gen-
erating a 1 g condition, did not show this effect. And thus the effects of spaceﬂight 0n the immune system are
related to microgravity and are indeed not just a mere artefact resulting from stress4’14. The molecular pathways
mediating these effects remain to be elucidated, but their knowledge could provide important clues on how to
device better therapies for conditions associated with exaggerated activation of the immune system on earth, e.g.
autoimmune disease or leukaemia.

Figure 1 | Summary of the experimental procedure and the timeline. The experiment was repeated three times. The ﬁrst experiment was performed as
part of the 2004 Soyuz TMA—4 campaign. Under the name Kappa it was executed during a manned ﬂight to the International Space Station. The
experiment was repeated in 2005 during the Maser 10 mission (Amuse) and again in 2012 during the Maser 12 mission (Micimmun). Both missions used
sounding rockets to carry the experiment into space. During a parabolic ﬂight the rocket reaches an altitude of approximately 260 km allowing for 5 t0 6
minutes of microgravity. The experiments are performed in automated climate chambers termed Flush Units. The Flush Units are placed within the BIM
module. The module regulates ambient temperature aboard the rocket and provides electricity to the Flush Units during ﬂight. As an onboard control the
Flush Units can be placed in a centrifuge which spins at a speed equal to the force of gravity. The other units are placed on a static rack and are allowed to
experience microgravity. Prior to the ﬂight the monocytes are placed inside a rectangular chamber containing two glass slides to which the monocytes
attach. At the start of microgravity a timed mechanism releases a spring plunger which replaces the medium in the culture chamber with medium
containing LPS. At the end of microgravity a similar mechanism replaces the LPS containing medium with ﬁxative. We would like to acknowledge NASA
and Dutch Space for the use of their illustrations in this ﬁgure.
