Abstract
This paper firstly has a brief review of the present status and future prospects of a method for precision mechanical based on the
levitation mass method (LMM). The LMM has been proposed and improved by the author. The force generated by the actuator is
measured as the inertial force of the mass levitated With sufficiently small friction using an aerostatic linear bearing and
connected to the moving part of the actuator. During the measurement, the Doppler shift frequency of the laser beam reﬂected by
the mass is measured With a high accuracy With the help of an optical interferometer. Subsequently, the velocity, position,
acceleration, and inertial force of the mass are calculated using based on this frequency. Simultaneously, the current and voltage
supplied to the actuator are measured.

1. Introduction
Force is one of the most basic mechanical quantities and is usually measured using force transducers. However,
the dynamic calibration method for force transducers has not been established yet. The lack of the dynamic force
calibration method results in the two major problems concerning material testing. On the one hand, it is difficult to

evaluate the uncertainty in the measured value of the varying force. On the other hand, it is difficult to evaluate the
uncertainty in the time at Which the varying force is measured.

According to this, the author has put forward a method, the “Levitation Mass Method” (LMM), as fig. 1 shows.
In the LMM, the inertial force of a mass levitated using a pneumatic linear bearing is used as the reference force
applied to the objects under test, such as force transducers, materials or structures. The inertial force of the levitated
mass is measured using an optical interferometer. The author has modified it as calibration methods for all the three
categories of the dynamic force calibration: dynamic calibration method under impact load [1], the dynamic
calibration method under oscillation load [2] and the dynamic calibration method under step load [3]. The authors
have applied the LMM to material testing, such as methods for evaluating material Viscoelasticity under an
oscillating load [6] and under an impact load [7], [8], a method for evaluating material friction [9,10], a method for
evaluating biomechanics [11], 12], a method for evaluating a dynamic performance of a liner motor [13], mass
measurement device (MMD) for use in the International Space Station (188) [14]—[18], a method for evaluating
dynamic response of impact hammers [19], a method for generating and measuring a micro—Newton level forces
[20]—[23]. The author has also applied the LMM as a method for investigating the frictional characteristics of
pneumatic linear bearings [24], [25] and the linear ball bearing [26], [27].

Fig. 1. Principle of the Levitation Mass Method
To improve the efficiency of the LMM, a pendulum mechanism [28] for use as a substitute of a pneumatic
linear bearing and a frequency measurement technique [29—31] using a digitizer instead of an electronic frequency
counter have been developed. Recently, a method for correcting the effect of the inertial mass on dynamic force
measurements has been proposed based on the LMM [32—34]. The optical interferometer also has been improved
[35—37].
In this paper, the recent achievement and the future prospects on the methods based on the LMM for evaluating
and calibrating the dynamic response for mechanical measurement was discussed.

A force transducer, Whose nominal force is 200 N, is attached to the base. In fig. 2, frequency counters are used
to measure the frequency of laser Which is detected by PDO, FBI and 2 respectively. When the velocity of the mass
(moving part) v1 is measured, then the position x1, acceleration a1, and force acing 0n the mass F mass of mass are
calculated With the result of velocity of mass. Simultaneously, the position x2 and acceleration (12 are calculated after
the velocity of the sensing element of the force transducer v2 is measured.

In fig. 3, red data are calculated by using the proposed method; the blue data are measured by using sensor; the
black data are the difference between red and blue data. Recently, the author found that the error in dynamic force
measurements is almost proportional to the acceleration at the sensing point of the transducer; this can be explained
as the effect of the inertial force of a part of the transducer itself [24]. The regression line, F reg =Fsensor — F mass
20.325 (12, is estimated from the relationship between acceleration a2 and the blue data. The inclination of the line,
0.325, can be considered as the estimated effective of inertial mass of the transducer.

The electrical quantities measured during the experiment were showed in fig. 6. Although the function generator
supplies a square wave of 35 HZ t0 the voltage—Current amplifier, the current eXhibits a dull waveform, while the
voltage eXhibits an overshoot waveform. Fig. 7 shows the mechanical quantities measured during the experiment.
First, the frequency is calculated from the digitized output signal of the optical interferometer and then the velocity,
position, acceleration, force, and mechanical power are calculated from the frequency. In this figure, approximately
8 periods of the reciprocating motion are observed.

Fig. 9 shows the Change in force acting on the mass from the arm under test, F =Ma, against position. At this
level of velocity on collision, the force varies roughly linearly With position. This is because the various nonlinear
effects have not fully come into play, such as the nonlinearity due to large deformation, i.e., Change of contact angle.
However, some non—linearity and hysteresis are observed in the curve, especially in the region of X < —2.0 mm. The
effect of nonlinearity can be further investigated by increasing the velocity of the collision.

5. Discussion

1) For dynamic force self—correction, the proposed method significantly improves the dynamic
Characteristics of a Widely used type of force transducer With only signal processing and Without the need of any
additional hardware, i.e. an accelerometer and its controller. The calibration is only required at the time of
manufacture using a calibration instrument based on the LMM, then the dynamic error correction can be done only
using the output signal of the transducer itself.

2) For material test, the materials tester consists of a linear motion guide of the mass and an optical
interferometer. As the linear motion guide, a small aerostatic linear bearing is used in the experiment. The friction
acting inside the aerostatic bearing is very small and the accuracy of its motion is very precise. However, it is
expensive and requires the compressed air. It cannot be used in the high—temperature, the low—temperature or the
vacuumed environments. If the pendulum mechanism developed [28] is used instead of the aerostatic linear bearing,
measurement under high— temperature, low—temperature or vacuumed environments Will be possible. The
introduction of an electromagnetic linear bearing Will also be effective for some purposes.

3) For Micro—force tester, the method is direct and based on the principle of Doppler shift and the Second
Newtonian Law. The simplicity and relative ease, With Which the test can be conducted, help to the ever increasing
need of the R&D engineering working on the demanding design of small, stronger, more robust HDD. In addition,
the authors Will develop numerical simulation and improve its accuracy and efficiency by comparing it With the
accurate experimental data obtained using the proposed measurement methods.

6. Conclusion

The dynamic calibration correction, material tester and micro—force tester based on the Levitation Mass
Method (LMM) have been reviewed. In the Levitation Mass Method (LMM), the inertial force of a mass levitated
using a pneumatic linear bearing is used as the reference force applied to the objects under test, such as force
transducers, materials or structures. The inertial force of the levitated mass is measured using an optical
interferometer.
