Absorbed dose and average linear energy transfer (LET) were assessed by means of 7LiF:Mg,Ti (TLD-700) thermolumines-
cent (TL) detectors for different panels on-board the Russian Segment of the International Space Station in the timeframe
between March and November 2002 (233 d). A technique is presented to correct the measured absorbed dose values for
TL efﬁciency in the radiation climate on-board the spacecraft. Average LET is determined from the high-temperature TL 9
emission in the TLD-700 glow curve and used as a parameter in the TL efﬁciency correction. Depending on the shielding 2
distribution, the efﬁciency-corrected absorbed dose varies between 154 i 5 uGy d—1 in panel no. 327 (core block ceiling) and CB?
191 i3 uGy d—1 in panel no. 110 (core block central axis, ﬂoor). The experimental data are compared with the model :81).
