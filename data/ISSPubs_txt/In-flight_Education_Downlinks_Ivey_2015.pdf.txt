Abstract

This article reports 011 a collaborative enterprise between Oklahoma State University’s
(OSU) NASA Education Projects and OSU’s College of Education preservice elementary
teachers (PSTs) to engage approximately 400 middle school students for a 20-minute live
downlink With Commander Kevin Ford from the International Space Station (188). NASA
supports this opportunity through a competitive proposal process (National Aeronautics and
Space Administration, 2014). The project’s theme, Pioneers in Space: STEM Careers 0n the
Space Frontier, engaged both PSTs and middle school students in discussing the benefits of
space research, While drawing on themes relevant to students” regional history. PSTs prepared
Pioneers in Space instructional units and led classroom activities linking 6th grade state science
standards. The desired outcome was to promote a greater understanding of how space
exploration benefits society and contributes to STEM innovations. This paper reports 011 how
curriculum design and leadership experiences in space education and outreach impacted the PST
participants.

Introduction

Forty years after the moon landing, live International Space Station (188) Downlink
experiences continue to help sustain public support and awareness about the beneﬁts of space
services (Entradas & Miller, 2010; Som, 2010). To date, millions of students have watched
erewmembers demonstrate space concepts and participated in live question and answer sessions.
NASA-sponsored downlink experiences provide key lessons related to life in space and how
scientists from different countries work together on the 188. These downlinks are intended “to

encourage K-12 students to study and pursue careers in science, technology, engineering, and
math (STEM)” (NASA, 2014, p. 1). MaoLeish and Thomson (2010) outlined the potential ways
space education events like these contribute to STEM education reform and for the development
of a global space science workforce. While NASA Downlink opportunities connect formal and
informal education about Earth and space science (Hofstein & Rosenfeld, 1996), reﬂective
evaluation by science education programmers identiﬁes the need to better utilize existing
educational resources and to develop more strategies for connecting teacher networks (Edgett &
Christensen, 1996; Kisiel, 2013; Stooklmayer, Rennie, & Gilbert, 2010).

Despite the importance of science subject knowledge to teaching, research literature
points to elementary teachers” lack of science content knowledge (e.g., Czerniak & Haney, 1998;
Diamond, Maerten-Rivera, Rohrer, & Lee, 2014; Dusohl, 1983; Fulp, 2002; Hone, 1970;
Westerbaok, 1982). In the area of space science, the concern is more grave as space science does
not hold a prominent place in the modern school’s science curriculum. Few teachers take space
science courses in their preparation programs nor were they exposed to rigorous space science
studies during their formative years. For instance, the typical K-12 science curriculum limits
space science a study of planets in the Earth’s solar system and phases of the moon. In this
study, researchers purposefully introduced preserVioe teachers (PSTs’) to authentic teaching and
learning space science experiences hypothesizing that these experiences would increase PSTs’
current knowledge of space science content and conﬁdence in teaching space science lessons.

Background

This research is informed by Kolb’s (1984) View of experiential learning wherein
knowledge results from a transaction between the learning and the environment. Learners enter
an experience with certain beliefs and understandings of the world honed through reﬂective
engagement with concrete experiences. Experiential learning experiences can encourage the
development of young science teachers to learn from other teachers, both in team building and in
ﬁeld-testing curriculum to engage learners (MaoLeish et a1., 2005; MaoLeish et a1., 2007). This
article contributes to research in experiential PSTs’ space science education by exploring how
such experiential learning might affect their science teaching self—efﬁoaoy, perceptions of space
science and scientists, and awareness of STEM careers. The following sections present literature
on four areas that help to frame the study within current literature on the following areas of
elementary teachers”: (a) space science preparation, (b) science teaching self—efﬁoaoy, (o)
perception of science and scientists, and (d) STEM career awareness.
Space Science Preparation

The lack of teachers who are prepared to teach Earth and space science challenges the
implementation of space education in elementary classrooms (Wysession, 2013). As a group,
elementary teachers have few experiences with space science experiences in their own K-12 and
post-seoondary science education. Typically, elementary space science content is limited to
learning about the planets and the solar system. Fortunately, renewed emphasis on Earth and
space science in the newly released Next Generation Science Standards ([NGSS], NGSS Lead
States, 2013) suggests new pathways and topics for learning about space systems. For example,
learning progressions (across grades1-5) guide students from an observational understanding of
the sky to a more sophisticated use of data and scientiﬁc modeling.

Indeed, there is an emerging need to engage elementary teachers in improving Earth and
space education and to provide professional development for preserVioe elementary science
teachers. Research suggests that engagement With space education content can improve
teachers” knowledge base and introduce them to a broad range of curricular materials available
through NASA’s education programs (MaoLeish et a1., 2008). Placing science learning in the
context of space explorations helps to create exciting science classroom content, encourage space
career awareness, and incorporate global perspectives about an interconnected world.
Science Teaching Self—Efﬁcacy

Borko and Putnam (1995) reasoned that teachers “must acquire richer knowledge of
subject matter, pedagogy, and subjeot-speoiﬁo pedagogy; and they must come to hold new
beliefs in these domains” (p. 60). Enoohs, Soharmann, and Riggs (1995) indicated that teachers
With low science teaching efﬁcacy are more likely to avoid teaching science than those teachers
with higher levels of science teaching efﬁcacy. Personal teaching self—efﬁoaoy is understood as
the belief in one’s own ability to effectively present the knowledge, perform the processes, and
guide students toward understanding (Bandura, 1977; Khourey-Bowers & Simonis, 2004).

Teaching self—efﬁoaoy is context speciﬁc (Bandura, 1982; Pajeres, 1996). Teaching self-
efﬁoaoy scales need to focus on both teaching and learning outcomes—thus the development of
subject specific instruments such as the Science Teaching Efﬁcacy Belief Instrument (Riggs &
Enoohs, 1990). Research suggests efﬁcacy beliefs are inﬂuenced by teacher attitudes and
anxieties about science (Westerbaok, 1982; Westerbaok & Primavera, 1988). Woolfolk and Hoy
(1990), however, provided evidence that preserVioe teachers might demonstrate improved
science teaching self-efﬁoaoy beliefs during their early career formation.
Perception of Science and Scientists

Historically, elementary teachers hold stereotypical images of scientists that relate to
negative images of science. It is important for teachers to have accurate perceptions of science
and scientists because they can inadvertently relay their perceptions and attitudes of science and
scientists to their students (Milford & Tippett, 2013). Further, children may not pursue a science
career due to the negative images associated With scientists (Fung, 2002; Kahle, 1988). The
research literature suggests that preserVioe elementary teachers enter their science methods
course With a stereotypical understanding of science and scientists (Abd-El-Khaliok & Akerson,
2004; Moseley & Norris, 1999; Rubin, Bar & Cohen, 2003). Thus, developing a better
understanding of preserVioe teachers” Views toward science and scientists is important to further
understanding how teachers” negative Views toward science and scientists inﬂuence their
instruction of science in the classroom (Kahle, 1988; Rosenthal, 1993).
STEM Career Awareness

MaoLeish and Thomson (2010) outlined the potential beneﬁts of space education for
STEM education reform and for the development of a global space science workforce. Recent
reports from educational research and outreach programs suggested that more efforts are required
to increase public understanding about STEM careers (Harris Interactive, 2012) and promote the
importance of early exposure to STEM careers (e.g., Morton, Kryk, Awender, & Diubaldo, 1997;
Tai, Qi Liu, Maltese, & Fan, 2006). Research ﬁndings indicated that children often have limited
notions about career choices beyond professional athlete, police ofﬁcer, and teacher (e.g., Bobo,
Hildreth, & Durodoye, 1998; McMahon, Carroll, & Gillies, 2001; Thomas, 2013). Additionally,

"
"4","Ivey, Colston and Thomas 4
Howard and Walsh’s (2010) research on career awareness conﬁrmed a range of self—reﬂeotion
and understanding about career choices and attainment—frorn fantasy and magical thinking to
higher order reasoning, which considers personal interests, abilities, and job requirements.
Schools and teachers can play an important role in increasing student awareness, interest,
and self—efﬁoaoy about careers (McMahon, Gillies, & Carroll, 2000). Some research explores
age-appropriate career education (McMahon & Watson, 2008), but very little is known about
teachers” career awareness or their efforts to raise students’ STEM career awareness (Hulings,
Thomas, & Drona, 2013). In fact, students may not be exposed to STEM careers in K-12
classes. As Causer (2010) found, 64% of students indicated that their teachers are NOT doing an
adequate job of effectively talking to them about engineering careers. Moreover, 42% of
students reported that teachers are inadequately teaching students how science is used in careers.
Purpose and Research Questions
This project, Pioneers in Space, intended to engage both PSTs and middle school
students in discussing the beneﬁts of space research, while drawing on themes relevant to
students’ regional history. We hoped to promote a greater understanding of how space
exploration benefits society and contributes to STEM innovations. The purpose of this research
was to examine how participation in the Pioneers in Space proj eot impacted the PSTs. As such,
this study asks: How does an experiential NASA learning experience impact PSTs’ ideas about
the teaching and learning of space science?
Methods
Participants
Participants were senior undergraduate elementary education majors enrolled in an
elementary science methods class during the semester prior to their student teaching. These
students sought generalist certiﬁcation for grades 1-8. Nearly all students enrolled in the class
(31 out of 32, or 97%) participated in the study. Of the 31 participants, most self—identiﬁed as
female (two as male). While 29 participants self—identiﬁed as white, one self—identiﬁed as
Hispanio/Latino and one as American Indian.
Context of the Study
Researchers first earned NASA’s support for a proposal, Pioneers in Space: STEM
| Careers 0n the Space Frontier. This collaborative project; {organized by researchers, local
middle school teachers and school leaders); engaged PSTs as leaders in preparing middle school
students for a NASA ISS downlink. Downlink preparation organized multiple opportunities for
developing middle school science lessons (led by PSTs and middle school teachers). Within
their elementary science methods course, the PSTs (11:31) began by reviewing online NASA
education resources. These lessons demonstrated the difference between mass and weight (on
earth and in mioro-gravity) by comparing classroom results with Video clips previously ﬁlmed by
astronauts performing similar activities onboard the 188. In particular, these lessons focused on
Newton’s Second Law of Motion (F=ma). The goal of these lessons was to guide middle school
students’ preparation of informed questions for Commander Ford at the time of the live ISS
downlink; these questions guided the format of the 20-minute downlink.

Methods class preparation. In groups, PSTs prepared lessons that would link STEM
career opportunities with life on board the ISS. During this process, it became apparent to the
instructor and the PSTs that their lack of space science content knowledge hindered the lesson
development process. Given the impending timeline of the ISS downlink, the course instructor
sought expertise from NASA Education Specialists to select preexisting NASA lessons.
Eventually, the instructor selected lessons titled Mass vs. Weight: A Heavy Duty Concept from
the Stennis Space Center (National Aeronautics and Space Administration, 2010) about the
behaVior of mass and weight on Earth and in microgravity environments. During the science
methods class, the course instructor modeled the Mass vs. Weight lessons. Wearing their student
hats, the PSTs practiced the lesson experiments in the methods classroom, which included
predicting, recording, analyzing, and interpreting collected data about the behaVior of masses.
Then, PSTs predicted how they thought the same masses would behave in a microgravity
environment. Next, PSTs watched a Video of astronauts performing the same mass vs. weight
activities on the ISS and compared their predictions to actual microgravity behaVior. Finally,
wearing their teacher hats, the PSTs worked in small groups to practice teaching the lessons to
each other prior to their authentic ﬁeld experience in the middle school setting.

Collaboration with middle school teachers. Three science teachers at the middle
school led participant sixth graders through a web quest on the NASA Website: International
Space Station: Painting the World Green (htth/wwwnasa.gov/extemalﬂash/issgreen
/index.html). This website provided students an opportunity to learn (a) about contemporary life
onboard the ISS and (b) how astronauts must maximize energy usage and use innovative
technologies to support life on board the ISS. Then, middle school teachers led students through
the ﬁrst lesson from the Mass vs. Weight series: Careers in Space. This introduction helped
prepare sixth graders for the PSTs’ lessons in the following week.

Middle school lessons. Before PSTs taught at the middle school, the science methods
course instructor assigned them to one of 6 groups (with 5-6 PSTs in each group) to cover the
three 6th grade science sections each hour. Half of the PST groups taught the morning class
sessions and the other PST groups taught the afternoon sessions (wherein PSTs had the
opportunity to repeat teaching the same lessons at least three times). While teaching the lessons,
each PST worked with a table group of students within the classroom. One PST would serve as
the facilitator to help pace the lessons and to present the ISS Video microgravity demonstrations.

ISS downlink experience. The NASA downlink experience was a full-soale community
event held on the university campus approximately one-week after the PSTs completed their
teaching at the middle school. The middle school students were transported to the event by bus.
The PSTs greeted each bus of students as they arrived on the university campus and escorted
them into the Viewing room. Other attendees included interested school, community, university
faeulty/students, and NASA ofﬁcials. Illustrative of the collaborative nature of the event, the
middle school librarian served as master of ceremonies and entertained the students while NASA
personal prepared for contact with Mission Control and the ISS.

During the first 30 minutes prior to the downlink program, a NASA Education Specialist
made a presentation about space survival. He demonstrated different types of food that
astronauts eat in space and how they attend to personal biological functions (a topic of interest

for sixth graders). Further, he invited three middle school teachers and three middle school
students on the stage to try on different pieces of a space suit and explained important survival
features of the suit components.

At the onset of the actual downlink, a hush fell over the crowd when they ﬁrst heard
Mission Control direct Commander Ford on the ISS and Stillwater Middle School students to
prepare for downlink. When Commander Ford appeared on the big screen, the crowd erupted in
cheers and applause. Importantly, 20 middle school students (selected by their classroom
teachers) and one PST (nominated by her peers) brought prepared questions they would ask
Commander Ford. These participant questions both organized the 30-minute downlink and
helped Commander Ford establish a personal connection with the audience at large.

Off—site individuals and classrooms could access the live event Via a live Video feed
streamed on the Internet. Ultimately, the live event had over 6,500 Internet hits; however, the
total number of individuals reached is difﬁcult to ascertain as a single hit could include
classrooms of students. Additionally, the event is archived at http://bit.ly/1waE2b for future
Viewing.

Design

This case study followed the participant-as observer model (Spradley, 1980) wherein the
lead researcher was also the instructor for the elementary science methods course. The case
study approach allowed researchers to “explain causal links in real-life interventions that are too
complex for the survey or experimental strategies” (Yin, 1995, p. 25). Researchers followed
mixed methods (Creswell, 2003) procedures wherein both quantitative and qualitative data were
collected simultaneously.

Measures and Analysis

Multiple measures assessed the impact of the experience on the preserVioe teachers” self-
efﬁoaoy and beliefs toward space science teaching, their perceptions of space scientists, and their
overall perceptions of the experience. Researchers entered data for the Space Science Teacher
Efﬁcacy Beliefs Instrument (S-STEBI) and the Draw-A-Spaoe-Soientist Test (DASST) into IBM
SPSS Statistics V21 for statistical analysis. Due to the small sample size and heteroskadisoity of
data, researchers utilized the nonparametric Wilcoxon Matched Pairs Sign Ranks test (Siegel,
1956). Description of quantitative measures, qualitative prompts, and analysis methods follow
here below.

Science Teacher Efﬁcacy Beliefs Instrument-Space. Researchers developed the
Spaoe—Soienoe Teacher Efﬁcacy Beliefs Instrument (STEBI-Spaoe) by adapting the Science
Teacher Efﬁcacy Beliefs Instrument (Enoohs & Riggs, 1990), a 23-item questionnaire
speciﬁcally developed to assess PST’s efﬁcacy of space science teaching. The original STEBI
consists of two subsoales: (a) Personal Science Teaching Efﬁcacy (PSTE) and (b) Student
Teaching Outcomes Expectancy (STOE). Researchers modiﬁed the STEBI by revising the 13
PSTE subsoale items to specifically reference space science rather than science in general. For
instance, the Personal Space Science Teaching Efficacy Beliefs (PSSTE) subsoale included
statements such as:

o I look for better ways to teach space science concepts.

"
"7","Bringing Space Science Down to Earth for PreserViee Elementary Teachers 7

o I understand space science concepts well enough to be effective in teaching space

science.

Researchers” creation of the STEBI-Space followed Rubeek and Enochs’ (1991) development of
the STEBI-CHEM. These researchers modiﬁed the STEBI in order to measure teachers” self-
efﬁcaey and science teaching outcome expectancy in teaching chemistry. Reliability and factor
analysis studies conducted by Rubeek and Enochs indicated that the PSTE and STOE constructs
of the STEBI-CHEM remained intact. In this study of the STEBI-Space, researchers were not
able to construct validity through factor analysis due to the small sample size. Instead,
researchers established face validity by consulting three different faculty with expertise in space
science education and teacher efﬁcacy.

Administration of pre/post surveys measured changes in teachers” beliefs toward space
science teaching and learning over the science methods course. The instrument includes 23
items wherein participants responded using a ﬁve-point Likert type scale ranging from Strongly
Disagree to Strongly Agree. Scoring was accomplished by assigning a higher score to the
positively phrased responses (5 = strongly agree, 4 = agree) and a lower score to the negatively
phrased responses (2 = disagree, 1 = strongly disagree). (Note: T welve items were reverse-coded
because they were negatively worded items.) The range of scores possible on the PSSTE is 13-
65 . The range of scores possible on the STOE is 10-50.

DraW-A-Space-Scientist Test. According to Finson and Pedersen (2011), instruments
like Draw-A-Scientist allow participants to transform their mental concepts about scientists into
Visual data by recording information into a form that researchers can analyze. In this study,
researchers looked to the long established model of the Draw-A-Scientist Test ([DAST],
Chambers (1983), to assess PSTs’ conceptions of a space scientist’s work and followed the
modiﬁed Draw-A-Scientist Test (mDAST, Farland-Smith, 2012; Farland, 2003) format and
scoring procedures. The mDAST format asks participants to draw three images rather than the
one single image common to the DAST. Researchers hypothesized this three-illustration-
expectation would illuminate greater depth and breadth of participants” understanding of space
scientists.

Researchers followed Farland-Smith’s (2012) recommended mDAST data collection
(wherein PSTs drew and described three images of a space scientist). mDAST scoring
procedures guided researchers review of the following space scientist features: appearance (what
space scientists look similar to), location (where space scientists work), and activity (what space
scientists do). Finally, researchers averaged participants” scores for each of these features across
all three images to determine signiﬁcant pre-to-post differences according to these factors.

Researchers followed Miles and Huberman’s (1994) multiple procedures to verify our
data. Recognizing the likely bias as preservice teacher educators (objectivity), researchers held
frequent meetings to insure high inter-rater consistency among the researchers and graduate
research assistant over time (dependability). Researchers continued data analysis and
discussions to reﬁne the coding, deﬁne the themes, inter-relate the mixed-methods results
(authenticity), and establish recommendations and likely implications (applicability).

End of project reﬂections. Following the ISS downlink, the PSTs responded to
researcher-developed, open-ended questions aimed to gain a deeper understanding how the
downlink experience impacted the PSTs’ awareness of teaching space science. Speciﬁcally, the
PSTs responded to the following prompts:

o What did you learn about yourself as a teacher of space science concepts through

your experiences with the NASA Downlink?

o How did your preparation to teach lessons at the middle school inﬂuence your
thoughts on the teaching of space science concepts?

0 How did teaching the NASA space science lessons inﬂuence your thoughts on the
teaching of space science concepts?

0 How did the NASA Downlink experience with Commander Kevin Ford on board the
International Space Station inﬂuence your thoughts on the teaching of space science
concepts?

These narrative data were analyzed by constant, comparative analysis, and results were
organized into themes as guided by this analysis (Merriam, 1988).
Results

This section organizes the ﬁndings of the study by measures: (a) Science Teaching
Efﬁcacy Beliefs Instrument-Spaoe, (b) Draw-A-Spaoe-Soientist Test, and (0) End of Project
Reﬂections.

Science Teaching Efﬁcacy Beliefs Instrument—Space (STEBI-Space)

A Wileoxon Matched Pairs Signed ranks Test (Siegel, 1957) pointed to significant gains
in participants” space science teaching efﬁcacy and beliefs. Table 1 indicates that PSTs made
signiﬁcant gains on the PSSTE scale (Z = -4.786, p < .001). Of particular interest, the minimum
score on teachers” PSSTE increased by 17 points. Changes in PSTs’ STOE score were also
statistically significant (Z = -2.476, p =.013).

While reviewing PSTs’ illustrations of a space scientist, researchers became interested in
understanding how the pre-to-post illustrations differed qualitatively in terms of the realism of
the space science portrayed. To supplement the DASST analysis, researchers completed a post
hoe qualitative analysis of the PST’s illustrations (n = 93). Independently, researchers examined
the images and followed an iterative open coding process to identify common themes related to
misconceptions or misunderstanding about space science. Then, each of the PST’s pre-to-post
images were coded along six emergent themed categories: Realistic and Current, Realistic but
Outdated, Fantasy/Soienoe Fiction, Classroom Teacher, Na'1've Conception, and Vague
Conception. See Table 3 for explicit descriptions of each category.

End of Project Reﬂections
Researchers identiﬁed three major themes in a qualitative analysis of PST’s ﬁnal project
reﬂections: Teaching is Learning, Students are Interested in Space, and Space Science is the
Future.
Teaching is learning. These PSTs ﬁrst identiﬁed themselves as learners in the Pioneers
in Space project. While they were initially concerned about their limited knowledge of space

science and their great fear of teaching sixth graders at the middle school, these PSTs came to
recognize their own prior misconceptions — about space science and about themselves. As one
PST summed it up, “[When we began this project,] I knew random facts about space (such as
people ﬂoat in space and wear very heavy suits) [but] Ihad to relearn the idea of gravity in order
to explain to students the idea of weightlessness in space.” Another of the PSTs recognized her
misconceptions going into the lesson development and classroom teaching, but discovered that
“Teaching is definitely a doorway to learning. I learned so much as I taught the lessons.” The
ideas of teaching-as-learning were common across the class and seemed to encourage these
PSTs. For one thing, the Pioneers in Space project introduced them to NASA websites which
the PSTs found to provide “great resources and information about space science.” As these PSTs
came to learn more space science content, in the context of developing and teaching a space
science lesson for sixth graders, they recognized new awareness of their own interest in science,
which caused them to think about themselves as science teachers. One PST explained, “I never
really thought about being a science teacher but this experience was so great. [It] showed me
just how curious I am about space science.”

Middle school students are interested in space. One theme that evolved was that the
Pioneers in Space project helped the PSTs develop a new awareness of sixth graders” enthusiasm
about space science learning. One surprised PST explained, “Teaching NASA space science
opened my eyes . . . students were fully involved, engaged, and excited throughout the lessons.”
While PSTs recognized students’ fascination with space created opportunity to “engage” and
“foster students’ ability to learn concepts of science such as mass and gravity,” they also came to
realize “space science is not just about creating the solar system with Styrofoam balls like [we]
did in middle school.” Further, PSTs were impressed by Commander Ford’s enthusiastic
interaction with the students during the ISS downlink. As one PST remarked, “Commander Ford
inspired a whole new group of students to pursue space science careers. He was so relatable . . .
just a normal guy who had an extraordinary dream.”

Space science is the future. These PSTs developed new enthusiasm about space science
as a result of their participation in the Pioneers in Space project. First, they came to think of
space science as important science and “not just some silly dream for some students to think
about but rather an interesting and important area [for all students] to learn about.” As one PST
reasoned, “It is important to teach our students about space science because it could be our future
and could impact our society greatly.” Once PSTs had completed their sixth grade space science
teaching experiences and experienced the live, ISS downlink with Commander Ford, they had
come to recognize how middle school science teachers might inspire the STEM workforce of
tomorrow. As one PST reﬂected, “Even if I could reach one student with space science content,
it would be completely worth it to push these future STEM and aerospace careers.”

Summary and Discussion

The purpose of this study was to examine how participation in a NASA learning
opportunity for middle school students affected preserVioe elementary educators. This study
focused on a novel approach to introduce PSTs to space science education by including them in
experiential space science learning opportunities. This section provides a discussion of the
results.

First, these ﬁndings indicated that the Pioneers in Space project positively affected the
PSTs’ science teaching efﬁcacy. The signiﬁcant gains made by the PSTs on both subscales of
the spaoe-STEBI indicate that this experiential space science experience positively affected
PSTs’ personal space science teaching efﬁcacy and their student outcome expectancy. Further,
the quantitative findings from the Spaoe-STEBI are further supported by the narrative,
qualitative data in that the preserVioe teachers began to identify themselves as teachers of space
science. These findings are consistent with other studies that examine the relationship between
experiential learning and increases in science teaching efﬁcacy in educators (Woolfolk & Hoy,
1990) and science content speciﬁc teaching efﬁcacy (e.g., Rubeok & Enoohs, 1991; Thomas,
Ivey, & Puekette, 2013).

Second, the findings from this study indicate that the project positively inﬂuenced the
PSTs’ perceptions of space science careers. Results from the mDAST suggest that PSTs made
signiﬁcant gains in understanding the work location of space scientists (but not space scientists”
appearance or activity); these results are likely due to the science lessons focused on the ISS and
corresponding downlink experience. Notably, however, these gains also include an improved
understanding of the context for space science on Earth, as well as space. This study helped to
address the call from other researchers about the need for educational research and outreach
programs to promote STEM career awareness (e.g., Morton et al., 1997; Tai et a1., 2006) and to
expand career options (Bobo et a1., 1998; McMahon et a1., 2001; McMahon & Watson, 2008).
Additional holistic analysis of the mDAST images indicate that PSTs tended to draw more
realistic illustrations (i.e. less fantasy or historical) of space scientists” work following their
experiential learning experience. Supported by situated learning theory (e.g., Billett, 1996;
Brown, Collins, & Duguid, 1989; Lave & Wenger, 1991), it is possible that the learning and
teaching of these space science lessons provided the PSTs with an authentic context in which
they had to immediately apply their learning as they taught middle school students.

Finally, this project positively impacted PSTs’ ideas about the teaching and learning of
space science. Qualitative analysis revealed PSTs observations of middle school students’
excitement about space science learning and its’ valuable pathway to better instruction and
engagement in the middle school classroom. Nearly 20 years ago, Sohoon (1995) found that
preserVioe teachers help many of the same Earth and space science misconceptions as their
students. The ﬁndings of this study indicate that preserVioe elementary teachers also hold
misconceptions about space science and space scientists. Finally, the qualitative analyses
indicated that PSTs had a new realization of space science as an important topic that needs to be
included in the elementary classroom because today’s elementary students have the potential to
be tomorrow’s space scientists.

This experience positively impacted PSTs’ space science teaching efﬁcacy beliefs,
perceptions of space scientists and space science careers, and ideas about the teaching and
learning of space science. In this study, PSTs made a connection between space science teaching
and student STEM career preparation. Additionally, some PSTs found new interest in
elementary science teaching and others found new interest in middle school teaching. Further,
opportunities to repeat-teaoh the same space science lesson allowed them to solidify their
understanding of the content and their pedagogy and provided important reﬂective opportunity

between classes. Elementary teachers, Who typically teach a lesson once to one group of
students throughout a school year, do not get similar opportunity to reﬂect on and reVise their
teaching according to student responses.

Similar to middle school students (Bobo et al., 1998), PSTs’ understanding of possible
careers is inﬂuenced by their experiences. Events like the NASA ISS downlink offer a distal
layer to PST education that inﬂuences their perceptions of potential space science careers; one
which compliments other individual and sooio-oultural inﬂuences (Ji, Lapan, & Tate, 2004),
especially since many students may not have exposure to such space science careers. Further,
this research suggests that, similar to elementary students (Auger, Blackhurst, & Wahl, 2005),
PSTs’ perceptions about space science careers are often based in fantasy and history. However,
after this experiential learning experience they developed a more realistic, less fantasy-based,
understanding of the work of a space scientist. As science educators work to raise awareness
about space science careers and STEM workforce issues, the training of elementary teachers Will
be Vital to helping children see that space career are indeed attainable. Certainly, these PSTs
changed perceptions about the location of space science research, on both the ISS and on Earth,
indicates that in-ﬂight education downlink experiences and NASA curriculum are effective in
this broader goal.

Overall, prior to this experience, the preserVioe teachers had a very limited understanding
of space science content and space science careers. The assignment of teaching middle school
space science lessons provided the PSTs With an authentic opportunity to learn and teach the
material. It seems that multiple opportunities to experience the space science lessons, wearing
both the student and teacher hats, afforded the PSTs an opportunity to become comfortable With
the content so that they could successfully teach the lessons to and facilitate the questions of
middle school students. The PSTs appreciated the learning and teaching of these space science
lessons, but needed more explicit practice to become more competent in the teaching of other
space science content. Further, the PSTs needed practice navigating and utilizing NASA
resources for instructional purposes.

Implications/Recommendations

These results clearly justify the need to provide PSTs With more experiential learning
opportunities related to space science content. The downlink With the International Space
Station provided a capstone to the activity that also provided relevance for learning to both the
preserVioe teachers and the middle school students. As such, it is important that science
educators provide PSTs With more opportunities to authentically learn (and learn by teaching)
space science content. Further, although it Will be a challenge, science educators should find
more ways to incorporate these types of learning opportunities into the methods classroom.
Opportunities may include collaborating With neighboring schools or community centers to
provide a family space science night much like the Family Science events
(www.familysoienoeorg). Faculty may also collaborate on a proposal for an In-ﬂight Education
experience of their own.
