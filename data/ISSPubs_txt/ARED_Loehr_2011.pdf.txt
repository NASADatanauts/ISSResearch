Adaptations to Training with the Advanced Resistive Exercise Device. Med. Sci. Sports Exerc., Vol. 43, No. 1, pp. 146—156, 2011.
Resistance exercise has been used as a means to prevent the musculoskeletal losses associated with spaceﬂight. Therefore, the National
Aeronautics and Space Administration designed the Advanced Resistive Exercise Device (ARED) to replace the initial device ﬂown on
the International Space Station. The ARED uses vacuum cylinders and inertial ﬂywheels to simulate, in the absence of gravity, the
constant mass and inertia, respectively, of free weight (FW) exercise. Purpose: To compare the musculoskeletal effects of resistance
exercise training using the ARED with the effects of training with FW. Methods: Previously untrained, ambulatory subjects exercised
using one of two modalities: FW (6 men and 3 women) or ARED (8 men and 3 women). Subjects performed squat, heel raise, and dead
lift exercises 3 d-wk—1 for 16 wk. Squat, heel raise, and dead lift strength (one-repetition maximum; using FW and ARED), bone mineral
density (Via dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry), and vertical jump were assessed before, during, and after training. Muscle mass (Via
magnetic resonance imaging) and bone morphology (Via quantitative computed tomography) were measured before and after training.
Bone biomarkers and circulating hormones were measured before training and after 4, 8, and 16 wk. Results: Muscle strength, muscle
volume, vertical jump height, and lumbar spine bone mineral density (Via dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry and quantitative computed
tomography) signiﬁcantly increased (P S 0.05) in both groups. There were no signiﬁcant differences between groups in any of the
dependent variables at any time. Conclusions: After 16 wk of training, ARED exercise resulted in musculoskeletal effects that were
not signiﬁcantly different from the effects of training with FW. Because FW training mitigates bed rest—induced deconditioning, the
ARED may be an effective countermeasure for spaceﬂight-induced deconditioning and should be validated during spaceﬂight.
