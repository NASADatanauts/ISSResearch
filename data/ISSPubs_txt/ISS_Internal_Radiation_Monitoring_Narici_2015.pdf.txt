A reliable radiation risk assessment in space is a mandatory step for the development of
countermeasures ahol long—oluratiOh mission planning in human spaceflight. Research in
raoliobiology provides information about possible risks linked to radiation. In addition, for
a meaningful risk evaluation, the radiation exposure has to be assessed to a sufficient
level of accuracy. Consequently, both the radiation models predicting the risks and
the measurements used to validate such models must have an equivalent precision.
Corresponding measurements can be performed both with passive and active devices.
The former is easier to handle, Cheaper, lighter, and smaller but they measure neither
