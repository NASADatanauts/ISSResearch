ARTICLEINFO ABSTRACT
Article history: Decreased bone mineral density (BMD) in astronauts returning from long—duration spaceﬂight missions
Accepted 24 Mareh 2010 has been well documented, but the altered mechanical loading environment experienced by the
— musculoskeletal system, which may contribute to these changes, has not been well characterized.
Keywords: The current study describes the loading environment of the lower extremity (LE) during typical days on
Spaceﬂight the International Space Station (ISS) compared to similar data for the same individuals living on Earth.
Bone 1055 Data from in—shoe force measurements are also used as input to the enhanced daily load stimulus
MEChehical loading (EDLS) model to determine the mechanical “close” experienced by the musculoskeletal system and to
Exemse associate this close with changes in BMD.

Countermeasures Four male astronauts on approximately 6—month missions to the ISS participated in this study.
ln—shoe forces were recorded using capacitance—based insoles during entire typical working days both
on Earth and on—orbit. BMD estimates from the hip and spine regions were obtained from dual energy
X—ray absorptiometry (DXA) pre— and post—ﬂight.

Measurable loading was recorded for only 30% of the time assigned for exercise. ln—shoe forces
during treadmill walking and running on the ISS were reduced by 25% and 46%, respectively, compared
to similar activities on Earth. Mean on—orbit LE loads varied from 0.20 to 1.3 body weight (BW) during
resistance exercise and were ~0.10 BW during bicycle ergometry. Application of the EDLS model
showed a mean decrease of 25% in the daily load experienced by the LE. BMD decreased by 0.71% and
0.83% per month during their missions in the femoral neck and lumbar spine, respectively.

Our ﬁndings support the conclusion that the measured lSS exercise durations and/or loading were
insufﬁcient to provide the loading stimulus required to prevent bone loss. Future trials with EDLS values
closer to 100% of Earth values will offer a true test of exercise as a countermeasure to on—orbit bone loss.
