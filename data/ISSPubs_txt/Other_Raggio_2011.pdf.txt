Abstract
The Lithopansperrnia space experiment was launched in 2007 with the European Biopan facility for a 10-day
spaceﬂight on board a Russian Foton retrievable satellite. Lithopansperrnia included for the first time the vagrant
lichen species Aspicilia fruticulosa frorn Guadalajara steppic highlands (Central Spain), as well as other lichen
species. During spaceﬂight, the samples were exposed to selected space conditions, that is, the space vacuum,
cosmic radiation, and different spectral ranges of solar radiation (xi 2 110, 2200, 2290, or 2400 nm, respectively).
After retrieval, the algal and fungal metabolic integrity of the samples were evaluated in terms of chlorophyll a
ﬂuorescence, ultrastructure, and C02 exchange rates. Whereas the space vacuum and cosmic radiation did not
impair the metabolic activity of the lichens, solar electromagnetic radiation, especially in the wavelength range
between 100 and 200nm, caused reduced chlorophyll a yield ﬂuorescence; however, there was a complete
recovery after 72 h of reactivation. All samples showed positive rates of net photosynthesis and dark respiration
in the gas exchange experiment. Although the ultrastructure of all ﬂight samples showed some probable stress-
induced changes (such as the presence of electron-dense bodies in cytoplasmic vacuoles and between the
chloroplast thylakoids in photobiont cells as well as in cytoplasmic vacuoles of the mycobiont cells), we con-
cluded that A. fruticulosa was capable of repairing all space-induced damage. Due to size limitations within the
Lithopansperrnia hardware, the possibility for replication on the sun-exposed samples was limited, and these
first results on the resistance of the lichen symbiosis A. fruticulosa to space conditions and, in particular, on the
spectral effectiveness of solar extraterrestrial radiation must be considered preliminary. Further testing in space
and under space-sirnulated conditions will be required. Results of this study indicate that the quest to discern the
limits of lichen symbiosis resistance to extreme environmental conditions remains open. Key Words: Astro-
