"1","ISS EXERCISE COUNTERMEASURES —
Evaluatlng Bone Loss In ISS Astronauts
Jean D. Sibonga; Elisabeth R. Spector; Smith L.Johnston;Wi|Iiam J.Tarver

INTRODUCTION: The measurement of bone mineral density (BMD) by dual-energy X—ray absorptiometry (DXA) is the Medical Assessment
Test used at the NASA Johnson Space Center to evaluate whether prolonged exposure to spaceﬂight increases the risk
for premature osteoporosis in International Space Station (ISS) astronauts. The DXA scans of crewmembers’ BMD during
the ﬁrst decade of the ISS existence showed precipitous declines in BMD for the hip and spine after the typical 6—mo
missions. However, a concern exists that skeletal integrity cannot be sufﬁciently assessed solely by DXA measurement of
BMD. Consequently, use of relatively new research technologies is being proposed to NASA for risk surveillance and to
enhance Iong—term management of skeletal health in Iong-duration astronauts.
KEYWORDS: densitometry, bone mineral density, trabecular bone, cortical bone.
