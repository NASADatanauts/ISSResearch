1 Abstract 1
Shedding of Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) by astronauts before, during, and after space shuttle 1
1 missions was quantified. Of 1398 saliva specimens from 32 astronauts, 314 (23%) were positive 1
for EBV DNA by PCR analysis. Of the saliva specimens collected before ﬂight, 29% were ‘
1 positive for EBV DNA and of those collected during or after ﬂight, 16% were EBV-positive.
1 The number of EBV DNA copies from samples taken during the ﬂights was 417 i 31, ,
1 significantly higher (P < 0.05) than the number of cepies from the preﬂight (40 i 1.7) and
‘ postﬂight (44 :1; 5) phases. Eighteen control subjects shed EBV DNA with a frequency of 3.7% ‘
1 and a copy number of 40 i 2 per m1 saliva. Ten days before ﬂight and on landing day, antibody 1
titers t0 EBV viral capsid antigen (VCA) were significantly (P < 0.05) higher than baseline 1
‘ levels. On landing day, urinary levels of cortisol and catecholamines, and plasma levels of 1
1 substance P and other neuropeptides, were increased over their preﬂight values. Results 1
. suggested that stress associated with spaceﬂight decreases cellular immunity and thereby leads to
increased viral reactivation.

1 Introduction ‘
‘ Spaceﬂight is a unique and stressful environment for humans. Astronauts experience a wide ‘
1 spectrum of stresses, such as isolation, confinement, fear, anxiety, psychosocial issues, sleep 1
‘ deprivation, and microgravity. These stressors may be intermittent or constant. Law
‘ enforcement officers, military personnel, and others also experience some of these stressors.
However, microgravity is a unique and constant stress, making spaceﬂight an environment not
1 duplicated anywhere on Earth. A wide range of physiological effects associated with 1
spaceﬂight, such as bone loss, muscle atrophy, neurological anomalies, and cardiovascular (

1 deconditioning, have been reported and reviewed [1~5] . The human immune response is also 1
L affected by spaceﬂight.[6] Changes have been reported in white blood cell numbers, leukocyte 1
and lymphocyte subsets, T-ce11 proliferation, cytokine production, natural killer cell cytotoxicity,
I and cell-mediated immunity [7-1 1] .
1 1
1 Glaser and others [12] have shown that stress is associated with the onset, duration, and intensity 1
1 of herpesvirus reactivation. We have previously shown that reactivation of Epstein~Barr virus 1
(EBV), cytomegalovirus (CMV), and varicella-zoster virus (VZV) increases in astronauts ‘
1
participating in space shuttle missions [13-15] . Psychological stress has been implicated in the 1
1 down-regulation of the immune system, and the response is mediated, in part, through the action
1 of stress hormones. The effects are remarkably similar to those seen in astronauts after ﬂight 1
1 [16] . In a group of Antarctic expeditioners serving as a ground-based model for spaceﬂight, we 1
1 showed that increased shedding of EBV was concomitant with decreased cellular immunity 1
1 [17] . This is consistent with Glaser et a1.’s [18] findings that antibody titers to the viral capsid
1 antigen (VCA) of EBV increased with the down—regulation of the cellular immune response in a 1
‘ student stress model. The increased EBV-specific antibody titers resulted from the memory B 1
1 1 ymphocytes’ response to increased amounts of viral protein after reactivation. We observed
similar increases in CMV antibodies in astronauts, beginning with the preﬂight phase and 1
1
1 continuing during the ﬂight and even during the first few days after landing [14] 1
Previous studies showed that the incidence of EBV reactivation in astronauts was higher during
the preﬂight phase than either the inﬂight 0r postﬂight phase [13] . This contrasted with our 1
1 findings in Antarctic expeditioners, where the incidence was higher in the 8- t0 9-month winter- ‘
‘ over isolation phase [17] . This study was undertaken to expand on our initial report of EBV 1

; reactivation in astronauts [13] by determining the amount of EBV shed during the three (before, i
during, and after) phases of a Space shuttle mission.
i
1 Materials and Methods
‘ Subjects were 32 astronauts (24 men aged 37 through 57 years, mean = 44 years; 8 !
women aged 32 through 47 years, mean = 39 years), all seropositive for EBV. They ﬂew ‘
I on 10 Space Shuttle missions of 9 tol4 days duration. Two Russian cosmonauts r
participating in an 83-day mission aboard the Russian space station Mir were also i
included in this study. Baseline (preﬂight) saliva samples were collected every other day
for l to 2 months, beginning about 6 months before the ﬂight. In—flight saliva samples
‘ were collected from crew members every day after their sleep period. Postﬂight samples .
i were collected on landing day (R+O) and every day for 2 weeks thereafter. Samples were ‘
collected in 1.0 ml of a biocidal storage buffer (1% SDS, 10m M Tris-Cl, 1 mM EDTA)
i and stored at room temperature during the mission. Upon return of the samples to Earth,
the saliva was collected by centrifugation and stored frozen until it was processed. All _
3 samples collected from each mission were analyzed simultaneously. Ground-based
analysis verified the ability of the stability buffer to preserve the viral DNA for ‘
subsequent PCR analysis [13]
‘ For measurement of viral antibody titers and stress hormone levels, a lO—ml EDTA blood ‘
sample and a urine sample were collected from each crew member 10 days before launch ‘
(L-lO), 2 to 3 hours after landing (R+O), and 3 days after landing (R+3). Plasma was ‘
. separated by centrifugation and stored at —70 °C until it was processed. Al] human study

protocols were approved by the Committee for the Protection of Human Subjects of the
J ohnson Space Center. ’
j Controls: Eighteeen healthy age-matched adults (14 male, 4 female) were included in ‘
this group. A saliva sample, a urine sample (10 ml), and a blood sample (10 ml, EDTA) ‘
‘ were collected at 3 time points from all 18 subjects. The schedule of collection of these ‘
samples mimicked the spaceﬂight (12-day) sample collection schedule (day 0 = L—lO, i
‘ day 22 = R+O for a 12-day ﬂight, and day 25 = R+3. These samples were treated the
. same way as those of crew members to measure EBV DNA, antibody titer, and stress
factors. i
y
Detection of EBV DNA
‘ Saliva specimens were concentrated with a 100K filtration unit (Filtron Technology I
C0rp., Northborough, MA) and extracted by a nonorganic extraction method (Qiagen
. Inc., Chatsworth, CA). EBV was detected with Digene Diagnostics, Gaithersburg, MD as
described earlier [13] .
r
a Quantitative estimation of EBV ‘
‘ EBV copies were measured in positive DNA samples by using the Viral Quant EBV
quantitative PCR detection kit (Biosource International, CA). A known number of c0pies ‘
of exogenous synthesized DNA internal calibration standard (ICS) were mixed with
sample DNA before it was extracted and amplified. The ICS has been constructed to ‘
I contain a PCR primer binding site identical to that of EBV DNA and a unique capture l
6

"
"7","i -'
binding site that allows the resulting ICS amplicon to be distinguished from the viral
‘ amplicon. EBV DNA was amplified with Viral Quant format primers, one of which is
i biotinylated. These primers target a conserved sequence of EBER 1. The EBER] gene is
expressed during EBV latency as a small nonpolyadenylated RNA transcribed by RNA
' p0] III. Sequences recognized by the two EBV—specific amplification primers are
identical for the type 1 and type 2 strains of EBV. After PCR was performed, the
amplicons were denatured and hybridized to either ICS 0r EBV sequence-specific capture i
oligonucleotides. Details are given elsewhere [19]
;
Measurement 0f EB V antibody titer i
‘ The titers of antibodies to EBV antigens VCA and early antigen (EA) were determined
by indirect immunoﬂuorescence assay (IFA) in the plasma samples collected from crew i
members 10 days before ﬂight, at landing, and 3 days after landing. Titers of antibodies
‘ to EBV-VCA were also determined in samples archived from the annual physical i
i examinations of the astronauts, which served as the baseline. These measurements were i
i also carried out on the samples collected from 18 controls. CommercialIy-prepared ]
substrate slides and control sera were used for determining EBV IgG and measles IgG
3 antibody titers (Bion Enterprises, Park Ridge, IL). Tenfold dilutions of plasma were
prepared with PBS. The endpoint titer was determined as the highest dilution of serum
giving immunoﬂuorescent cells. All specimens were batch analyzed and read blind—
Coded.

spaceﬂight. ‘

‘ Neuropeptides
The neuropeptides substance P, calcitonin gene-related peptide, neumpeptide Y, and

participated in one of the IQ space shuttle ﬂights included in the study. They were i

‘ measured in samples collected 10 days before the ﬂight, 2 to 3 hours after landing, and 3 ?
days after landing by a receptor-affinity chromatographic technique coupled with
immunological detection [22]

Statistical analysis

To test whether EBV activation was signiﬁcantly increased during ﬂight we first expressed each
‘ subject’s in-ﬂight EBV copies as a difference from his/her pre-ﬂight average. Next, this change in

EBV COpies was regressed on time in ﬂight (days) using generalized estimating equations in a

general linear model setting [23] with a normal family. In the process, standard errors were

obtained using the Huber-White “sandwich” estimator [24, 25] to account for repeated

measurements on some subjects at different times during ﬂight; for example, one subject’s EBV
count was measured on nine different days. After fitting the regression model, we tested the null
i hypothesis of no increased activation any time during ﬂight, which is equivalent to both the

intercept and the slope of the regression line being zero. Confidence limits for both the slope and
intercept were also obtained.

Results

EBV DNA was detected in 22.5% of the saliva samples (314/1398) collected from 32 1
astronauts before, during, or after 10 spaceﬂights (Table 1). This rate was significantly '
1 higher (P < 0.05) than the 3.7% EBV—positive samples from the 18 control subjects. Of

the saliva specimens collected about 6 months before ﬂight, 29.1% were positive for

EBV DNA. Of those collected during and after spaceﬂight EBV was positive in 15.7% 1
‘ and 15.5% samples respectively. Control values over a period simulating a 12-day space ’

shuttle mission did not vary significantly. ‘
The distribution of EBV copies found before, during, and after the ﬂight is shown in
1 Figure 1. Although the frequency of EBV DNA was nearly 2-f01d greater in the samples
collected before ﬂight than in those collected at other times, the number of copies of EBV ‘
DNA was significantly (P < 0.05) higher (about 10-fold) in the samples collected during
I ﬂight than in preﬂight or postﬂight samples. The number of EBV copies (mean per m1
saliva 1: SE) was 40.3 i 1.7 before, 417.2 : 31.] during, and 44.3 i 5.4 after ﬂight. The
median of the number of EBV copies detected in saliva samples increased as the duration
1 Of ﬂight increased. The estimated equation for Y, (the increase in EBV count) is Y: 23.9t +215, 1
where t is ﬂight time in days. The test of the null hypothesis of no increase at any time during ‘1‘
l ﬂight was overwhelmingly rejected (P < .0000]), that is, there was a significant increase in EBV 1
’ copies during ﬂight than pre or post ﬂight. In addition the rate of increased EBV copies per day
of ﬂight (23.9) was significantly greater than zero (P = 0.00013) that is, as the duration of ﬂight

i The durations of these space shuttle missions ranged from 9 to 14 days. Two Russian I

cosmonauts participating in an 83-day mission aboard the Russian space station Mir had ‘

1 similar EBV shedding patterns and an increased number of EBV copies during the ﬂight

I phase. The mean number of EBV copies per m1 of saliva was 24.7 i 3.9 before the ﬂight

. and 18.8 i 6.9 after the ﬂight. During the long ﬂight the number of EBV copies soared

1 to 451 j; 79.3. These data, shown in Figure 2, were divided in to three groups, first
group, 21 to 40 days; second group, 41 to 60 days; and third, 61 to 75 days. The number
of EBV copies was highest during the first and the third group during the ﬂight. }

1 Shuttle astronaut VCA antibody titers at 10 days before launch (L-10), at landing (R+O),
and 3 days after landing (R+3) were significantly increased (P < 0.001) from the baseline

‘ values taken 5 to 24 months before ﬂight (Figure 3). Titers were the same at L-10 and

; R+0, but increased further at R+3 (P < 0.001 ). As expected, no significant change was

‘ observed in the titer of antibodies to EBV early antigen (EA). As a control, we measured

L measles IgG antibody titer and found no change from baseline levels throughout the '

‘ study interval. The VCA IgG antibody titers of 18 control subjects were similar to the

‘ astronaut baseline levels and did not change across the 3 sampling times.

'

Stress hormones were measured at three time points, one before launch (L- 10) and two

. after landing (R+0 and R+3) (Figure 4). The level of cortisol in plasma was not

significantly lower after landing than before ﬂight, but plasma levels of insulin and

9 cortisol, epinephrine, and norepinephrine in urine at R+O were significantly higher than at
l L-10 (Panel B) (p<0.05). The controls had no such changes during the study period. l
l
} Neuropeptides were measured in plasma of 5 crew members before and after a 5-day
ﬂight. Levels of substance P (SP), calcitonin gene—related peptide (CGRP), neuropeptide ‘
S Y (NY), and vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP) were significantly higher (p<0.05) ‘
(Figure 4) at R+O than at L-lO. However, 3 days after landing, only SP showed a further
‘ increase which was statistically insignificant. CGRP, NY, and VIP either showed no l
l further increase from their R+O levels or declined. In case of control group, these Changes a
| were not observed.

Discussion
‘ This study is a follow-up of our initial finding that astronauts shed EBV before, during, and (
, immediately after spaceﬂight [l3] . We previously found that the shedding frequency was
higher during the preﬂight phase than during either the ﬂight or postﬂight phase. The a
1 current study confirmed that finding. The major objective was to determine if the number ‘
0f COpies of viral DN A correlated with shedding frequency. We quantified the amount of l
i EBV shed in astronauts’ saliva during all three phases of space shuttle missions. Although
the frequency of EBV shedding in saliva was higher before ﬂight, the number of EBV .
copies was 10-fold higher during the ﬂight phase. This indicates that the intensity 0r
‘ combination of stressors experienced by astronauts while they are in space may be
I responsible for the increased EBV DNA in saliva. The data (Figures. 1 and 2) also
! indicated that the number of EBV copies increases as a function of days in space. Saliva ‘

l

"
"12","1 samples from cosmonauts aboard the Russian space station Mir for 83 days contained more
copies of EBV DNA than saliva samples from the US astronauts particularly in space ﬂight
missions of 14 days or less. Also, the peak number of EBV copies (1 130/ml) in samples T
from cosmonauts was higher than the maximum number of copies (738/m1) in samples ‘1
1 from US astronauts. Taken together, data from the short-term and long-term space ‘
missions indicate that the numbers of EBV shed in saliva may increase with increasing
time in space. 1
Glaser [18, 26, 27] and others have studied EBV reactivation in several stress models and l
‘ found increased reactivation of EBV as measured by increases in antibody titers t0 VCA. 1
_ Glaser et al. [12, 28] also showed that reactivation of EBV was a function of the type of
; stress. For example, physical stress associated with basic training of West Point cadets did
1 not result in EBV reactivation. However, stress associated with final examinations resulted ‘
in substantial viral reactivation. Consistent with their work, we have found that VCA titers ‘
1 increase before ﬂight and continue to increase through 3 days after ﬂight. This indicates ‘
that astronauts are exposed to substantial levels of various stressors, resulting in EBV i
reactivation beginning well before ﬂight.

i Examining hormone profiles provided further evidence of stress exposure. Urinary levels
of cortisol and the catecholamines were significantly higher after ﬂight than before ﬂight. '
These data were consistent with results from the Skylab missions [29] and previous space I
shuttle missions [14, 30] . Cortisol, epinephrine, and norepinephrine in urine are usually 1

i and landing process. Plasma levels of cortisol at landing were not elevated over preflight
% values. The peak plasma level of cortisol, which has a circadian rhythm, may have occurred 1
‘ before or after the sample was collected. Plasma cortisol, which has a short (~4-hour) half- I
9 life, was collected only once before and once after spaceﬂight, giving a “snapshot” look at i
a plasma levels, whereas each urinary cortisol value was obtained from a pool of urine 1
I collected over a 24-hour period. The “snapshot” of plasma cortisol may have missed
; transient but significant changes that were detected in urine, which provided an integration (
of 24 hours of collection[30] . All of the neuropeptides measured (SP, VIP, NY, and
CGRP), were elevated immediately after landing. Only SP had increased even more by 3 E
V
days after landing. Increased VIP, SP, and CGRP levels have been associated with
a decreased cellular immunity [31, 32] . Similarly, increased levels of NY have been found y
l
in chronic stress subjects [33] . Until the neuropeptide data from the 5 astronauts can be i
expanded to a larger number of participants, the significance of changes in neuropeptide
‘ ' levels cannot be adequately assessed. However, these findings are consistent with data ;
i from Antarctic expeditioners and astronauts. We previously demonstrated decreased
l cellular immunity in Antarctic expeditioners during a stressful 8-9 month winter-over ‘
I
period at the Australian Antartic science stations [17] . Taylor et a1. [6] demonstrated a
\‘ decreased cell-mediated immunity in astronauts during spaceﬂight. \
The viral shedding patterns, virus-specific antibody titer response, increases in stress
hormones, and increased levels of neuropeptides lead us to draw some conclusions. N0 ‘
correlation was observed between increased viral reactivation and age, sex, flight
3 experience or nature of the duties (e.g., pilot vs. non pilot) of the crew members. ;

i
and after ﬂight aboard the Space shuttle. The intensity or combination of stressors during
‘ the ﬂight may vary significantly from the stressors experienced before or after the ﬂight.
Our data indicate that more EBV is shed in saliva during spaceﬂight than during the
ground phases of preparing for the mission and recovering from spaceflight-associated
; stress. The increased amount of EBV DNA in saliva, coupled with the propensity of large
i
‘ and small saliva droplets to ﬂoat in the microgravity of the crew compartment, may lead
to increased risk of cross infection among crew members. One would expect minimal
medical effects of such events in healthy individuals, but the effectiveness of the immune
response of astronauts has been questioned [6] .
Studies are in progress to determine if the increased reactivation of EBV in
astronauts is a general effect extending to other human herpes viruses, and
if it produces any health effects in astronauts on space missions longer
than 14 days.
