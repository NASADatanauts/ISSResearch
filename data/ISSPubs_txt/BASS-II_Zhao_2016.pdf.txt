Abstract
Flame growth, spread, and quenching extinction over a thin composite cotton—ﬂberglass fabric blend (re—
ferred to as the SIBAL fabric) were studied in low—speed concurrent purely forced ﬂows aboard the Interna—
tional Space Station. The tests were conducted in a small ﬂow duct within the MicrograVity Science Glovebox.
The fuel samples measured 1.2 and 2.2 cm wide and 10 cm long. Ambient oxygen was varied from 21% down
to 16% molar concentration and ﬂow speed from 55 cm/s down to 1 cm/s. A slow purely forced ﬂow resulted
in a small ﬂame, enabling us to observe the entire history of ﬂame development including ignition, ﬂame
growth, steady spread (in some cases), and decay at the end of the sample. In addition, by decreasing ﬂow
velocity during some of the tests, low—speed ﬂame quenching extinction limits were determined as a function
of oxygen percentage. The quenching speeds were found to be between 1 and 5 cm/s with higher extinction
speeds in lower oxygen atmospheres. The shape of the quenching boundary supports the prediction by earlier
theoretical models. These long duration microgravity experiments provide a rare opportunity for solid fuel
combustion since microgravity time in ground—based facilities is generally not sufﬁcient. This is the ﬁrst time
that a low—speed quenching boundary in concurrent spread is mapped in a clean and unambiguous manner.
A previously developed three—dimensional transient model is modiﬁed to compare with the experiment. The
modiﬁcation includes the use of two—step SIBAL fabric pyrolysis kinetics where the rate constants are de—
termined using Thermo—Gravimetric Analysis data. The model yields good quantitative comparison on the
quenching boundary, the ﬂame transient development, and the steady ﬂame spread rates.
