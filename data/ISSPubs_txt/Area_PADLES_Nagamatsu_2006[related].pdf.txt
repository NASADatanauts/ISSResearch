1. INTRODUCTION

Radiation dosimetry on board the International Space Station (IS S) is very important for
investigating biological effects in a space radiation environment. Personal radiation dosimetry for
astronauts is also a necessary manned space technology.

We have developed a Passive Dosimeter for Life Science Experiments in Space (PADLES).
The PADLES package consists of two types of passive and integrating dosimeters, a CR—39 Plastic

utilized for monitoring radiation doses in the Japanese Experiment Module ‘Kibo’ 0f the ISS and
the personal dosimetry of Japanese astronauts. Because the PADLES package is light, compact and
battery—less, it is convenient to use in space ﬁom the following aspects: less crew time required,
maintenance ﬂee, installation extremely close to biological samples, and easy to attach to
astronaut’s clothing and ExtraVehicular Activity (EVA) suits.

Thus far, some Japanese research groups have ﬁequently used a combination of the CR—39 and
TLD for space radiation dosimetry in a Low Earth Orbit (LEO) where the ISS and Space Shuttles
ﬂym). In 1998, some of the authors measured radiation doses using the combination of CR—39 and
TLDs for space radiation effect research of human culture cells on the STS—95 shuttle missi0n(8).
Through these past space radiation measurements using the CR—3 9, there was seriously recognition
that manual measurements of a large number of etch pits of the CR—39 were inefﬁcient, laborious,
tedious, and needed too much time to get results. Japanese researchers related to space radiation
dosimetry, therefore, recognized a strong need for making a well—calibrated ‘standard’ dosimeter
package, establishing a higher—speed automatic analyzing system of the CR—39 and securing
technical eXpeIts in charge of the actual operations of radiation dosimetry for supporting Japanese
space programs that extend over a long period 0fti1ne. In 2000, we therefore started to develop the
PADLES system for a ﬁJture routine dosimetry service on the 188 in the space environment
utilization center of the Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency (JAXA). Since 2001, we have carried
out ground—based experiments with gamma rays ﬁom 137Cs and 60C0, and heavy ion beams ﬁom a
HIMAC accelerator 0f NIRS, Japan, to obtain the TLD and CR—39 response data over a wide linear
energy transfer (LET) range ﬁom an ionization minimum of 0.2 keV/ttm up to several hundreds of
keV/tth). PADLES has also been examined on board the ISS, parallel with the development of the
PADLES system.

In this paper, we ﬁrst describe the characteristics of space radiation to be measured with
PADLES. We then describe the present status of PADLES; including the package conﬁguration,
the methodology, the procedure for space radiation dosimetry, and the analysis system. The
performance of an automatic analysis of the CR—39 etch pits is also discussed.

2. Characteristics of space radiation in LEO

There are three primary radiation sources (galactic cosmic rays, solar paIticle events, and
protons trapped in Earth’s radiation belts) in ﬁee space outside spacecraft in LEO with an altitude of
300 to 500 km. The radiation environment inside spacecraft, however, becomes more complicated.
When passing through the walls and facilities of the spacecrafts, these primary space radiations
produce many secondary paIticles due to their interactions with electrons and nuclei that constitute
the spacecraft’s mass. These secondary paIticles such as energetic charged paIticles and neutrons,
contiibute to increase doses for astronauts and the bio specimens used for space experiments. The
space radiation environment in LEO is characterized as follows: 1) remarkably high contiibution of
high LET radiation having a high quality factor (QF) inﬂuential to living entities; 2) absorbed dose
rates in space have a value of a few hundred times as much as those on the ground; 3) radiation

3. PADLES

CR—3 9s have been utilized by J apanese researchers in space radiation dosimetry and for
tracking High—Z and high—Energy (HZE) paIticles in space biological experiments along With
bio-specimens, for example, silkworm and human cell culture. One year’s effort was needed to
obtain the results ﬁom the CR—39, because of the manual measurements for a number of etch pits
With an optical microscope. The bio-specimens involved changed generations Within a few months.
In ﬁJture biological experiments on board the ISS, therefore, it is desired that CR—39s be analyzed as
soon as possible so that biologists can reasonably make an experiment program for the recovered
bio-specimens based on the dosimetiic results given by the CR—39.

PADLES has been developed as an exclusive system for space radiation dosimetry in JAXA.
Using this system, we can promptly obtain radiation doses for a loading period With high statistical
accuracy, and Without encountering errors in the manual measurements of a CR—39.

TLD readouts are calibrated with 160 MeV protons and corrected for fading effects at their
loading temperaturesm) (12). The absorbed dose for < 10 keV/um is obtained by subtracting the part
of the TLD readout due to space radiation exceeding 10 keV/um, Dﬂdzlo, ﬂom the total TLD
readout. We experimentally obtained the LET response function of TLD (MgZSiO4sz) as
illustrated in Fig. 1. Dﬂdzlo is estimated by using the LET distribution for Z 10 keV/um measured by
the CR—39 and the LET response ﬁanctions 0f TLD for Z 10 keV/um in Fig. 1.

3.2. Analysis procedure

Figure 2 gives a schematic diagram of the standard PADLES analysis procedure. Two
programs, “TLDPADLES” and “AutoPADLES” were developed for a prompt and routine
analysis. This system drastically reduces the maximum analysis time of the PADLES package,
typically down to about two weeks.

3.2.1. Preparation of packages

A standard PADLES package consists of four CR—39 plastic plates (HARZLAS TD-1: FukiVi
Chemical Industry) and seven TLD elements (TLD—MSO: Kasei Optonics, LTD.) as depicted in
Fig.3. A TLD is Mg28i04 powder sealed in a glass tube with Ar gas. The dosimeter package is
wrapped in Al foil and permacel tape to shield the TLD elements ﬂom light. One of the CR—39
plates is a sample previously exposed to heavy ions (448 MeV/n 28Si, 410 MeV/n 56Fe) with the
HIMAC heavy ion accelerator. This plate is used as a reference to check sensitivity stability of the
CR—39 during a space ﬂight experiment. The external size of the package is typically 2.5 cm X 2.5
cm X 0.6 cm. Ground—eontrol packages are prepared along with the ﬂight packages for each space
experiment. To measure the positions and the LETs 0f HZE particles incident to biological samples,
we use a stack of CR—39 plates and the biological samples are used for tracking particle traj ectories.

About two thousand TLD elements were prepared for PADLES. Every element was exposed
to gamma rays ﬂom 137Cs and 60C0 to check the individual TL response. TLD PADLES manages a
database of all TLD elements, including serial number, history of use, present status, individual
calibration constants for protons and 60C0 gamma rays, and TL readouts in past exposure
experiments. By using TLDPADLES, a set of TLD elements is selected for each ﬂight experiment
so that the response deviation is less than 5%. The TLD elements are annealed at 5000C for 20 min
before packaging.

After the ﬂight experiments, the PADLES packages are disassembled in a JAXA laboratory,
and the TLD and CR—39 are analyzed following the procedure outlined in Fig.2.

So far, PADLES has been utilized twice for radiation effect research in space. One was for
biological effect research in the STS—95 mission of the Space Shuttle Discovery (8.9 days ﬁom 29
October to 7 November 1998). This mission had a unique orbit of a high altitude (574 km) and a
low inclination (28.45 0) (NASDA and Eril Research 2003) (15). The other was for radiation damage
research with Charge—Coupled Devices (CCDs) of a High—Deﬁnition Television camera (HDTV).
This was a long-term experiment on the 188 Russian segment for 446 days ﬁom 21 August 2001 to
10 November 2002, and three PADLES packages were loaded for radiation monitoring and
tracking of HZE particles incident to CCDs. The orbit of the 188 Russian segment was 389 km in
average altitude and 51.60 in inclination, which was a normal 188 orbit. The three PADLES
packages were exposed for 71, 256, and 446 days respectively.

Using CR—39 plates loaded in the STS—95 mission and the 188 Russian segment, we examined
the performance of automatic etch—pit analysis by AutoPADLES in space radiation dosirnetry. First,
we automatically obtained LET distributions by AutoPADLES without any manual correction. For
veriﬁcation of AutoPADLES, an operator checked every ellipse analyzed by AutoPADLES for a
manual correction; removing etch—pit—like obj ects due to dust and artiﬁcial scratches, and
reanalyzing obj ects on which AutoPADLES failed in ellipse ﬁtting. Figure 7 depicts LET
distributions in the 188 Russian segment for 71 days. The LET distribution ﬁom Auto PADLES
was higher than that with the manual correction for LET values exceeding 10 keV/ttm, but the
difference was small as shown in Fig. 7(a). We also calculated LET distributions ﬁom LRP samples
(13.5 h etching) and SRP samples (5.5 h etching). Figure 7 (b) shows that the LET distribution ﬁom
the SRP sample was in agreement with that ﬁom the LRP sample in a10wer LET region. This result

methods. The absorbed doses were in good agreement within errors among the four methods.
Because 90 % of absorbed doses in LEO is attributable to the lower LET radiation of <10 keV/nm,
the difference in the etoh-pit measurements contributes less to total absorbed doses. The total dose
equivalents obtained by “fully—automatio AutoPADLES” were about 9 % higher than those
obtained by “semi—automatio AutoPADLES” in both space ﬂights of LEO. Results by the automatic
ellipse—ﬁtting in AutoPADLES included dust. The maj or and minor axes of inclined tracks were
ﬁequently overestimated because a binarization process before the ellipse ﬁtting in AutoPADLES
extracts an excessively dark tail along with etoh-pit mouths. Such overestirnations in the etch pit
analysis of AutoPADLES is currently under investigation. The dose equivalents measured by
“SRP+LRP” were in good agreement within errors with those by “SRP” as depicted in Table 1. If
LET distributions are able to be estimated by using only SRP samples, we can ﬁthher save the labor
in the CR—39 analysis.

The result of PADLES on STS—95 and the Russian service segment were very consistent with
past ﬂight results on 188.

Table 1 Comparison of results with different CR—39 analysis methods in LEO radiation
dosirnetry by PADLES. “Fully—automatio AutoPADLES” implies a fully—automatio ellipse ﬁtting
of etoh—pits. “Semi-automatio AutoPADLES” implies that ellipses ﬁtted in AutoPADLES were
manually corrected by an operator. “SRP+LRP” implies that the LET distribution for Z 50 keV/nm
was measured with a SRP sample and the LET distribution ﬁom 10 to 50 keV/nm with a LRP
sample. “SRP” implies that the LET distribution over the whole region for 3 10 keV/nm was
measured with only a SRP sample. Errors are statistical ones (one standard deviation).

5. Future works

At present, PADLES packages are being applied to the MATROSHKA and ALTCRISS
proj ects on board the ISS. MATROSHKA is an international proj ect conducted by the German
Aerospace Center in Cologne (DLR: Deutsches Zentrum ﬁler Luft und Raurnfahrt) for estimating
an astronaut’s exposed dose during EVA with various types of passive and active dosimeters. A

"12","human phantom was set up with the dosimeters in a pressurized container, the thickness of which
simulates the shielding effect of a space suit. The container was installed on an outside wall of the
Russian segment for 538 days in the ﬁrst ﬂight ﬁom 19 January 2004 to 11 October 2005. The
ALTCRISS proj ect was conducted by the National Institute of Nuclear Physics (MM, and one of
the obj ectives is to study the ISS radiation environment at various positions in the 188 under
different shielding conﬁgurations. In 2007, after JEM is attached to the International Space Station
(188), the PADLES system will be widely applied for monitoring radiation environments inside
JEM, a personal dosimetry for J apanese astronauts, and international experiments such as
MATROSHKA and the ISS biological research experiment proposed in the international
announcement of 0pp01tunity in order to investigate biological effects produced by a space radiation
environment. Data will be offered to astronauts and researchers ﬁom 2008 and will be regularly
recovered ﬁom the 188 every 6 months.
6. Summary and conclusions
We developed the PADLES system in order to support J apanese space programs that extend
over a long period of time. This system includes a ‘standard’ dosimeter package consisting of
CR—39 PNTDs and TLD-MSOs, a high—speed seaming system for the CR—39 PNTDs, the
TLDPADLES program managing TLD elements and the AutoPADLES program for automatic
analysis of CR—39 etch pits. AutoPADLES also has the function of automatic calculation of space
radiation doses ﬁom readouts 0f the CR—39 PNTDs and TLDs based on detailed response data of
the dosimeters for high—energy heavy ions. The PADLES system allows us to provide dosimetlic
results for biological researchers within 2 weeks after the return of their PADLES packages to
JAXA.
