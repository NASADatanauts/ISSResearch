capillaries, 0r microgravity conditions. To study the inﬂuence of a convection-free environment on protein crystal quality and to
evaluate two different experimental implementations to achieve it, we have made a comparative analysis of crystals grown by
capillary counterdiffusion in agarose, a convective-free environment on Earth, and crystals grown in microgravity at the International
Space Station. Thermotoga maritima triose phosphate isomerase (TIM) was chosen as a model for this study. The statistical analysis
reveals a signiﬁcant improvement for the crystals grown in microgravity in terms of their Rmergg, B-Value, and mosaicity, but the
statistical evidence is insufﬁcient to show a similar beneﬁt for the resolution and mean intensity parameters. These results are quite
surprising because it is known that, unlike gels, the noisy microgravity scenario Offered by the ISS cannot sustain a convection-free
environment on the time scale of days required for protein crystallization experiments.
