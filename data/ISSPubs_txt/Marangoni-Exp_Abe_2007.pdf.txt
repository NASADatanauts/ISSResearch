Effect of Shape of HZ Liquid Bridge on
Particle Accumulation Structure (PAS)
Introduction
We focus on the dynamic particle accumulation structure
(PAS) due to thermoeapillary effect in a half-zone liquid The Japanese Experiment Module (IBM) is the manned

the present study by tracking particles in the liquid bridge physics experiments on the particle accumulation structure
and by measuring temperature over the free surface. It is (PAS) in a half—zone liquid bridge. This phenomenon was
found that the variation of the Shape of the liquid bridge introduced by Schwabe et al. [1] and its three dimensional

change of its azimuthal velocity near the free surface. the effect of the shape of the liquid bridge described by its

Experiments
Experimental apparatus is described in Fig. 1. Test ﬂuid was
silicone Oil of 2 CSt. Tracer particle was silver-coated hollow
glass spheres (S-HGS) 0f 10 pm in diameter. A liquid bridge
was formed between top and bottom coaxial rods. Radius of the
both rods was 2.5 mm, and height of the liquid bridge was
ﬁxed at 1.6 mm, whose aspect ratio (H/R) was 0.64. We
described the shape of the liquid bride by volume ratio V/Vo,
m where V and V0 are the volumes of the liquid bridge itself and
of a cylindrical liquid bridge (V0 = 7IR2H), respectively. We

corresponds to the variation of the surface temperature
