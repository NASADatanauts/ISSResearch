ABSTRACT

On the ISS, as on Earth, water is an essential element for life and its quality control
on a regular basis allows to ensure the health of the crew and the integrity of equipment.
Currently, microbial water analysis onboard ISS sti|| relies on the traditional culture-based
microbiology methods. Molecular methods based on the amplification of nucleic acids for
microbiological analysis of water quality show enormous potential and are considered as
the best alternative to culture-based methods. For this reason, the Midass, a fully
integrated and automated prototype was designed conjointly by ESA and bioMérieux for a
rapid monitoring of the microbiological quality of air. The prototype allows air sampling,
sample processing and the amplification/detection of nucleic acids. We describe herein the
proof of principle of an analytical approach based on molecular biology that could fulfill the
ESA's need for a rapid monitoring of the microbiological quality of recycled water onboard
ISS. Both concentration and recovery of microorganisms are the main critical steps when
the microfiltration technology is used for water analysis. Among filters recommended
standards for monitoring the microbiological quality of the water, the polycarbonate filter
was fully in line with the requirements of the ISO 7704-1985 standard in terms of efficacy
of capture and recovery of bacteria. Moreover, this filter does not retain nucleic acids on

"
"3","the surface and has no inhibitory effect on their downstream processing steps such as
purification and amplification/detection. Although the Midass system was designed for the
treatment of air samples, the first results on the integration of PC filters were encouraging.
Nevertheless, system modifications are needed to better adapt the Midass system for the
monitoring of the microbiological water quality.

"
"4","1 INTRODUCTION

As on Earth, on the International Space Station (ISS), water is an essential element
to life, but for the ISS crew its volume and overall availability is limited. Supplying the
5 freshwater via space cargo is a very expensive process and the onboard storage is also
challenging in terms of volume and water quality. Water regeneration is thus a major
element of astronauts' life-support system. To reduce the costs, the water is currently
recycled by two systems designed to produce safe drinking water: one in the US
«Destiny» module (Water Recovery Systems: WRS), and another one in the Russian
10 «Zvevda» module named SRV-K [1] [2] [3]. This water is the stock for drinking water,
food preparation and hygiene. To assure its quality, the water is treated in a closed system
with biocides: silver on the Russian side and iodine on the US side. This complex system
of treatment and storage can increase the risk of microbial contamination, namely the
development of biofilms. Microbial contamination can also arise when connecting
15 freshwater tanks arriving from Earth to the circuit. Therefore, it is very important to control
regularly the water quality with accurate methods before its consumption. In fact, the water

quality on ISS is regularly checked (in-flight and post-flight) [4].
ln-flight, water quality monitoring is performed, via microbial analysis tools, once
every 3 months for the Russian side and once per month for the US side. These tools are
20 part of the EHS (Environmental Health System) package. The microbial analysis
corresponds to a detection and an enumeration of microorganisms (bacteria, fungi and
coliforms). For bacteria and fungi, a microbial capture device (MCD) containing a filter is
used and the micro-organisms are concentrated on the filter surface. This filter is then
placed on a general-purpose agar medium that allows the growth as colonies and thus
25 enumeration of most of the microbes of interest (Total Viable Count (TVC): bacteria and
fungi). After an incubation period at a given temperature, microbial load is determined
through a counting of CFUs (Colony Forming Units). The specific detection of coliforms is
performed using a dedicated analysis bag (CDB: Coliforms Detection Bag) which contains
the dehydrated growth medium that dissolves when mixing with the 100 ml water sample.
30 After an incubation period of 2 days at 28—37°C a bright magenta color indicates the
presence of coliforms, while their absence is indicated by a the yellow color. For the water,
the acceptability limits are of 50 CFU/mL for the TVC and of O CFU/mL for total coliforms
[5] . Samplings are also taken for each water consumption port, twice per mission (about
once every 3 months) for post-flight, microbial and chemical analysis (""archive water
35 samples""). These water samples are collected into dedicated 1 liter water-bags and are

"
"5","stored aboard ISS and transported at ambient temperature. The ""archive water samples""
are not limited to potabIe/regenerated water sources, condensate is regularly sampled,
and other samples can be taken on specific requests. Once back on Earth, water archive
samples are stored in the laboratory at 2°C-10°C and analyzed on the same day or as
40 soon as possible. Several testing methods are then used such as: filtration, plate counts,
coliform test. Identification of the micro-organisms relies on biochemical tests
(identification using Vitek) and 168 sequencing if needed. To date, the bacterial
identification is performed after samples return on Earth. This information is considered at
the moment as an issue because it is available a week or more after samples are returned
45 on Earth, while it might be much more useful to react rapidly in case of a microbial water
contamination, or in the worst case an outbreak that would occurs aboard the ISS [6] .

In the past, the water quality monitoring has shown the presence of ubiquitous and
inoffensive microorganisms [7] [8] [9] . However, in a closed environment, such
microorganisms could represent a serious threat to the crew [10] [11] [12] [13] .

50 Several factors can affect the immune system of astronauts [14] . Among causes that
may increase the infection risk, fluctuating atmospheric pressure, decrease of hygiene,
new diet, microgravity, radiations or containment have been proposed [15] [16] . The
same factors can also modify certain biological mechanisms of microorganisms, and play
a role in the acquiring of resistance mechanisms in bacteria. The infection of one astronaut

55 could lead to a disaster situation on board of the ISS due to limited treatments, difficulty in
isolation process and impossibility to quickly return on Earth. Moreover, some microbes
and particularly molds were shown able to seriously damage some critical hardware (i.e.
telecommunication wires) due to their corrosive capability, and consequently are
considered as a serious threat to astronauts [13] [11] [17] . Thus, this risk is a

60 consequence of limitations of the culture-based methods applied on-board spacecrafts.
Besides associated contamination risks, the culture-based methods are manual and
require a long incubation period (up to 2 and 7 days for bacteria and fungi, respectively)
which represents a cumbersome task for astronauts. Moreover the absence of
identification of the micro-organisms onboard prevents the detection and identification of

65 an environmental contamination or of an infection case.

Contrary to culture-based methods, the molecular biology-based methods are often
automated, more sensitive, specific and they allow a quicker contamination detection and
implementation of appropriate corrective actions when required. Hence, they are perceived
as an attractive alternative to the traditional culture-based methods for a rapid monitoring

70 of the bioburden [18] . Indeed, molecular—based methods detect both viable and non-

"
"6","viable cells [19] [20] [21] , but also VBNC (Viable But Non-Culturable) cells [22]
[23] which are absolutely not detectable by the growth-based method. However, to date,
there are no such commercially available tests due to the technical challenges faced to
meet the requirements for full automation, from sampling to the results interpretation.

75 These requirements are key parameters for the pharma and space industries where the
time to results is crucial.

In response to the need of an alternative method to the growth-based method, over
the last decade, the European Space Agency (ESA) and bioMerieux initiated a co-
development of Midass (Microbial Detection in Air System for Space), a fully automated

80 system for the monitoring of the bioburden of the environment in space ships that may also
be useful for confined spaces, including clean rooms and hospital ward. Even if the system
needs the presence of a human to initiate the process, Midass doesn’t require a qualified
technician. The system is based on molecular technologies (sample preparation/
amplification/detection) and enables rapid and simple determination of the microbiological

85 contamination level Le. a ""molecular TVC"" with results in less than 3 hours. The lysis step
takes place in a rotary device called Peppermill (PPM). When the spindle of the PPM is
being rapidly rotated in contact with glass beads, a shearing force is produced, and is high
enough to break cells including microbial spores. The detection module allows the
amplification/detection processes either on nucleic acids from crude lysates or on purified

90 nucleic acids. False positive results are the main challenge in molecular biology, especially
for a molecular tool based on a large spectrum such as TVC. Consequently, all
consumables are produced individually in clean conditions that comply with ISO 5
standards.

Recently, the Midass molecular tool, in a version devoted to fungi enumeration

95 (pan-fungi), was successfully used in a study carried out in an area at high risk of the
hospital such as a hematology ward, where molds are objectionable microorganisms in
surfaces and air [24] .

The present study was focused on the selection and assessment of an effective

method for the capturing/concentrating/recovering bacteria from water samples, which

100 could be compatible with the downstream steps, namely those of Midass system. The
capturing/concentrating steps should be also easy to use and non-cumbersome for the
crew. If microfiltration can be easily selected because it is already used for
capture/concentration of microorganisms from water samples in the ISS and is also a
widely an accepted method on Earth, we have had to validate its use and compatibility

105 with the Midass process. Since the Midass system is still a prototype, this study has been

"
"7","limited to a feasibility study of sample preparation phase until DNA recovery that excludes
any specific development. Therefore, in the frame of the present study based on the
molecular approach, an ideal filter should be effective to retaining microbial cells on its top
surface, being easily crushed by the PPM while excluding microbial free nucleic acids. On
110 the contrary, a lack in effective capture, irregular milling or nucleic acid capture by filter
debris would unfortunately leads to false negatives.
Based on ISO standards applied to water quality, two filters were highlighted
(cellulose filter and Polycarbonate filter) which are regularly used for controlling bioburden
in drinking water. Moreover, a third filter, the polyester filter, was also studied because it is
115 already used internally in solid cytometry applications applied to liquid samples. However,
the cellulose filter doesn’t retain the microorganisms on surface [25] and therefore we
have decided not to include it in the present study since it will be more difficult to recover
all the microorganisms that are trapped inside this filter and not retained on the surface.
The comparison of both filters the polycarbonate (PC) and the polyester (PE) has rapidly
120 concluded to an inhibitory effect of the polyester filter while the capture rates of both filters
were identical except with small bacteria such as Pseudomonas aeruginosa where PE
filter didn’t work as expected (data not shown). Consequently, the PC filter was considered
as a filter that potentially complies with the all requirements of this study.
The polycarbonate filters have been reported to be hydrophilic and to efficiently
125 capture microbial cells due to the uniformity of the pore size on its upper surface [25] .
Furthermore, the polycarbonate filter is only lightly charged and does not retain nucleic
acids, unless modifications are carried out [26] . We report herein the development of a
concentration step upstream of Midass system, which is based on microfiltration
polycarbonate-based filter that complies with ISO standard 7704-1985 in which the capture
130 efficacy is at least 80%. Furthermore, no negative impact has been observed on the cell
viability nor on amplification/detection of nucleic acids when both steps capturing and
recovering were performed on a polycarbonate based-filter. Thus, with the upstream
microfiltration step, the Midass system would allow to address the ESA needs in terms of
contamination issues on air, surfaces and water.

"8","2 MATERIAL AND METHODS
2.1 Microbial strains and culture conditions.
Strains used in this study are: Escherichia coli (ATCC 11775T), Pseudomonas
140 aeruginosa (ATCC 1O145T) and Burkholderia multivorans (DSM 13243T) for bacteria, and
Candida albicans (ATCC 64553T) for fungi. Strains were first grown on solid medium, then
a pure colony was picked-up to be inoculated in a liquid broth and incubated overnight at
the appropriate temperature. Growth rates were determined based on measurements
using a densitometer (bioMerieux, France). Working suspensions were set at 0.5 Mac
145 Farland Units (approximately 108 CFUs/ml), from which calibrated inputs were obtained
through serial dilutions. Dilutions containing 102 and 103 CFU/mL were spread on Petri-
dishes and incubated overnight. The CFU counting allowed the adjustment and a better
estimation of cells number considered for downstream processing.
150 2.2 Filtration
The filters used are polycarbonate track-etched filter of 25 mm in diameter and
0.4 pm in pore size (Whatman, England). For filtration, the membrane filter was either
simply mounted on a filtration device adapted for syringes or placed onto one of three
stainless-steel holders contained in a filtration ramp. Thus, a sample liquid broth, that
155 contains calibrated cells, was filtered through the filters under a vacuum air flow.
2.3 Capture rate (R)
Based on the ISO standard 7704-1985 (Water quality -- Evaluation of membrane
filters used for microbiological analysis), the capturing rate (R) of the polycarbonate filter
160 was assessed, and corresponds to the ratio between the average of cells contained in a
liquid sample (mp) and the average of cells calculated from the sample once filtered (mf).
Thus, 1 mL of calibrate broth of about 25 CFU/mL was filtered through the filter and
deposited on appropriate growth medium. The initial number of cells in the liquid broth was
determined by plating 200 “L in triplicate on Petri-dishes followed by an overnight
165 incubation at 37°C, then a counting of CFUs. The capture rate is calculated as follows:
R = (mf/ mp) X 100.
2.4 Elution of bacteria based glass beads
After filtration, the filter is introduced into a plastic tube containing glass beads and a
170 buffer solution (water for injection). Then, the tube is vortexed during 20 minutes at

"
"9","maximum power. To finish, the resulting suspension is recovered prior to cell lysis and
nucleic acids purification.
2.5 Nucleic acids extraction
175 The extraction and purification of nucleic acids were performed on the NucIiSENS®
EasyMAG® (bioMérieux, France) and the Midass miniaturized prototype called SPM
(Sample Preparation Module) designed for the sample processing.
1.1.1 NucIiSENS® EasyMAG® (EZM)
180 Nucleic acids were extracted from bacterial suspensions using the NucIiSENS®
EasyMAG®, BioMerieux’s automated sample preparation instrument (bioMérieux, France).
After a lysis step, the instrument allows an automatized extraction (purification and
concentration) of total nucleic acids (DNA and RNA) from biological sample based on the
Boom technique [27] . Purified nucleic acids were eluted in 25 “L of elution buffer
185 (bioMérieux, France) and either used or stored at -80°C.
1.1.2 Midass sample preparation module (SPM)
Briefly, 300 “L of each calibrated cell suspension were either directly added into the
PPM or concentrated on the filter before to fill the PPM. Then the PPM is assembled as
190 previously described. Cell lysis is triggered when cells, in contact with glass beads, are
subjected to a shearing force generated by the spindle in mechanical rotation at 2000 rpm
for 2 min. The obtained crude lysate undergoes the nucleic acids purification steps
according to the Boom technique, which takes place in a 0.5 “L tube already prefilled with
197.2 “L of lysis buffer (bioMérieux, France), 30 “L of silica beads, 0.8 “L internal control
195 of PanBacteria at 107 copies/mL and 1.4 “L internal control of PanFungi at 109 copies/mL.
Purified nucleic acids were eluted in 25 “L of the NucIiSENS® easyMAG® elution buffer
(bioMérieux, France) and either used or stored at -80°C
1.2 Nucleic acids Amplification/detection
200
1.2.1 NASBA
The NASBA (Nucleic Acids Sequence-Based Amplification) was performed using
the NucIiSENS® Basic kit (bioMérieux, France). Five microliters of purified nucleic acids
were added to 10 “L NASBA buffer [final concentration in 20 “L reaction mixture: 40 mM
205 Tris-HCL, pH 8.5, 12 mM MgClg, 70 mM KCL, 5 mM dithiothreitol, 15% vol/vol

"
"10","dimethylsulfoxide (DMSO), 1 mM of each dNTP, 2 mM of each NTP]. For each specific
NASBA assay, 0.2 “M of specific primers were used (Table 1) and 0.1 “M of specific
molecular beacons were added. In fact, these molecular beacons are specific sequences
and bear the 6—carboxyfluorescein dye (FAM) and the carboxy-X-rhodamine dye (ROX),
210 for which the fluorescence readings occur at 518 nm and 604 nm, respectively for the wild-
type target and the internal control. Once assembled, the mixture is pre-incubated at 65 °C
for 2 min to allow denaturation of RNA target, followed by 2 min at 41 °C. Then, five
microliters of enzyme mixture (0.08 U RNase H, 32 U T7 RNA polymerase, 6.4 U reverse
transcriptase) were then added to start the RNA amplification and incubated at 41 °C for
215 90 min. ReaI-time detection of NASBA products was performed using the NucIiSENS®
EasyQ® Analyzer (bioMerieux, France). Data were analyzed on the NucIiSENS® EasyQ®
Director software (Version 2) which allows a real time follow-up of the NASAB results
[28] [29] [30] . For further customized data analysis, we also used the Spotfire®
software (TIBCO Software, USA) in which the Q-ratio (amplification ratio between nucleic
220 acid target and the internal control) was plotted against the logarithm of the concentration
of the wild type.
In NASBA, the results are expressed in Genome Equivalent (GE). This unit
corresponds theoretically to the chromosomal DNA contained in one cell, in other word 1
GE = 1 CFU.

1.2.2 RT-PCR
The Reverse-Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction was performed with the
Agilent MX3005P qPCR System (Agilent technologies, Genomic Solution Division, France).
The 16S rRNA was used as a target and the amplification was performed using the
235 LightCycIer RNA Master HybProbe kit (Roche®, France). To the RT-PCR mix (7.5 “L of
Master mix at 2.7X containing: DNA Polymerase, reaction buffer and dNTP mix, 1.3 “L of
50mM Mn(OAc)2, 0.5 uM of primers, 0.25 HM of probes and 10L of internal control at 106

reaction was performed at 61°C for 20 min, followed by the PCR reaction that consisted of

240 45 cycles with a temperature profile of 5 seconds at 95°C, 15 seconds at 50°C and 15
seconds at 72°C. The analysis was performed through the comparison of CTS, where CT
stands for cycle threshold and which is a measure of the number of PCR cycles to get
fluorescent signals.

2.2 Interaction between nucleic acids and polycarbonate filters
We performed experiments with purified Candida albicans nucleic acids
concentration ranging from to 0.2 to 2.102 GE/uL. Nucleic acid solutions were tested on
NASBA either with or without filtration. All nucleic acids solutions were then subjected to
260 amplification/detection based on the Pan-fungi NASBA tool which uses a specific internal
control. As shown in Figure 1A, the internal control exhibited a positive NASBA signal in 96%
while it was negative in 4% of the tests (these results are in line with the specifications).
Positive NASBA signals were obtained on all tested nucleic acid solutions as shown in
Figure 1A. Moreover, no significant differences were shown on filtered and non-filtered
265 nucleic acid samples based on the analysis of the Q-ratio parameter against the logarithm
of the concentration of the wild type (Figure 1, B).

"
"13","Taken together, these results suggest that nucleic acids are not retained and neither
degraded by the polycarbonate filter.

2.3 Compatibility between peppermill and polycarbonate filters
Fortunately, the filter can be inserted into the PPM. Thus, 300 pl of bacterial
280 suspensions ranging from 103 to 104 CFUs were either filtrated on the PC filter, then this
filter introduced into the PPM, or directly added into the PPM.

No negative impact has been observed on the SPM components when the lysis was
carried out in the presence of the PC filter (data not shown). As shown in Figure 2A, no
inhibition was observed on the NASBA since the internal control was always amplified and

285 detected. Moreover, the presence of the PC filter into the PPM did not affect the bacterial
lysis, nor the nucleic acids purification as shown in Figure ZB. In fact, the Q-ratio results of

"
"14","filtrated and non-filtrated suspensions were almost identical except for one sample where
the weak Q-ratio might be explained by a difficulty during the RNA elution step. To explain
these results, several extractions and amplifications on filtered samples have been made
290 with different bacterial loads. On 136 performed extractions, 12 amplifications failed
(8.82%).
These results show that the PPM was able to efficiently process the PC filter in 91.18%
of the cases.

2.4 Assessment of the bacteria elution concentrated on the PC filter
305 To assess the bacteria elution we decided to test a new approach that allows the

using glass bead. Therefore, we have substituted the Midass SPM which is still at the
prototype scale (for air sampling) by the NucIiSENS® EasyMAG® system that is already
commercially available. Moreover, a sensitive Eubacterial RT-PCR tool has been set
310 internally and we decided to use it instead of NASBA. As for the PPM approach, three
bacterial species were used (Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Burkholderia
multivorans) in suspensions ranging from 102 to 106 CFUs/ml. Regardless of the used
microbial species, there were no significant differences when comparing the Ct values
obtained on samples filtered or not (Figure 3).
315 These results show that the filter can concentrate the bacteria on its top without fixing
them irreversibly.

"16","3 DISCUSSION
On board the ISS, bacteria are considered as a major threat for the crew's health as
well as the spacecraft's integrity [13] [11] [17] . In these circumstances, water

325 monitoring is absolutely necessary to avoid disease outbreaks and material degradation
[31] [32]. For this reason, our study focused on the rapid monitoring of the water
microbiological quality through the setting up of a molecular analytical tool based on the
existing Midass system in which, microorganisms should be captured, concentrated, lysed,
then nucleic acids purified, amplified and detected.

330

Our results have shown that the PC filter does comply with ISO standard 7704-1985
which stipulates a capture rate of at least 80% (Table 2). Since the detection tool, used in
this study, is based on a molecular approach tool in which nucleic acids are amplified and
detected after being extracted from captured bacteria onto the polycarbonate filter, we

335 have checked whether these bacterial nucleic acids might irreversibly adhere to the
surface of the filter and consequently lead to a false negative result. This filter does not
retain nucleic acids and no NASBA inhibition was observed (Figure 1, A & B). Despite the
fact that the PC filter fit into the PPM and was compatible with the downstream processing
on the Midass SPM module (Figure 2A), the nucleic acids yield was considered to lack of

340 reproducibility which could explain differences in Q-ratio analysis shown in Figure ZB.
Furthermore, we investigated whether this non-reproducibility of the nucleic acids yield is
due to the PC filter or the downstream processing using the Midass sample preparation
module. The new approach, using glass bead to elute the concentrated bacteria on the top
of the filter, has shown that the PC filter can capture then release the bacteria without

345 fixing them definitively (Figure 3). Thus, the variability observed on the nucleic acids yield
previously discussed (Figure ZB) would seem to be a consequence of the processing of
the filter into the PPM which has been designed specifically to handle samples from air
and surfaces.

350 This study shows that microbial concentration, recovery and nucleic acids purification
out of the PC filter constitute an efficient sample preparation compatible with nucleic acids
testing. This may improve the analysis of water quality in the future.

Thus, the Midass (Microbial Detection in Air System for Space) can easily be adapted
to optimally integrate the filtration step which is mandatory for the monitoring of the

355 microbiological water quality. To adapt the Midass prototype to the PC filter effective

"
"17","processing, we mainly propose a modification at the geometry level of the PPM: by the
widening the inlet chamber for instance. Indeed, such modification will effectively facilitate
