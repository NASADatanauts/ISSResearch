Abstract
For successful health programme of Japanese astronauts during space activity in the International Space Station (188), we looked into
the sleep quality of astronauts by using Fuzzy C-Means (FCM). At the ﬁrst step, we collected observation data by following sleep schedule
of astronaut Noguchi for ﬁfteen days (26 July 2005 to 9 August 2005) during STS-114 spaceﬂight. The Fuzzy C-Mean (FCM) was used to
design the score quality of astronauts' sleeps. We deﬁned three condition of sleep quality (e.g. sleepy, sleep, deep sleep) with the minimum
score (zero) and maximum score (nine). Based on the preliminary result, we found that the minimum sleep score of astronaut Noguchi was
from 7 t0 9 August 2005 which was due to landing process and the maximum sleep score we found was later than 27 July 2005 during
docking on 188.
