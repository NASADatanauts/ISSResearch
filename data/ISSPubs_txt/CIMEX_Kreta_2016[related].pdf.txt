Abstract. Study Of convection in a horizontal liquid layer (ethanol) evaporating into the gas

ﬂow (air) has been performedThe tWO-dimensional velocity ﬁeld in the liquid layer is Obtained

using the PIVmethod. It is shown that the temperature rise induces signiﬁcant Changes in the

convective ﬂow structure. The main factor determining structure of convective ﬂows Within

the liquid is the thermocapillary effect.
1. Introduction
Study of heat and mass transfer through the gas-liquid interface is one of the most important problems
in the present time. The intensive evaporation from the liquid surface into the gas ﬂow induces various
convective ﬂows Within the liquid. The structure of the convection can have complicated form and
causes a direct effect on the evaporation rate. The considered processes are commonly used in mini-
and microchannels of the apparatus such as heat pipes, ﬁlm evaporators, tWO-phase cooling systems,
etc. The interest to the problem is provided by experiments under normal gravity and microgravity
conditions as well as by the preparation of experiments on the International Space Station in the frame
of the scientiﬁc project “Convection and Interfacial Mass Exchange” (CIMEX) of the European
Space Agency and Roscosmos [1, 2]. These experiments are aimed to study the features of the
convective ﬂows of a ﬂuid under conditions of a gas ﬂow and evaporation.

Evaporation of a liquid into air or inert gas implies a limitation of the evaporation rate by diffusion
of vapor into the gas. However, the presence of an inert gas also strongly induces surface-tension-
driven (thermal Marangoni) instabilities in the liquid,[3].These instabilities can enhance the heat
transfer through the gas-liquid interface and increase evaporation form the liquid surface. The
dynamics of thermal ripples at the interface of a volatile pure liquid (ethanol) has been studied
experimentally and numerically in [4]. 2D and 3D numerical simulations has been performed in the
work [5] to study of relation between convective thermal patterns and heat ﬂuX through an evaporating
surface.The exact solution of the stationary problems of a convective ﬂuid ﬂow in a horizontal layer
With a thermocapillary interface being under action of a gas ﬂow has been constructed in [6, 7]. The
work [6] demonstrated reverse ﬂow of the ﬂuid to the direction of the gas ﬂow near the gas-liquid
interface and possibility to control the convection in the ﬂuid by means of the gas ﬂow. It was shown
experimentally in [8], that the action of thermocapillary effect resulting from temperature gradient at
the gas—liquid interface of the falling liquid ﬁlm may induce some structural changes in the ﬂow and
may lead to a reverse ﬂow in the liquid ﬁlm. Theoretical study of instabilities in a horizontal liquid
layer in co-current gas ﬂow With an evaporating interface is presented in [9].

The aim of this work is to experimentally study the structure of convective ﬂows and to measure

tWO-dimensional velocity ﬁeld distribution in the liquid layer under the action of the gas ﬂow using
PIV method.
2. Experimental setup
The experimental investigations were conducted on the setup shown in Fig. 1. The setup consists of
the following components: test section, gas and liquid loops, data acquisition system, thermal
stabilization system, and optical techniques. Pure gas enters t0 the test section from the compressor.
The mass ﬂow controller sets ﬂow rate of the gas at the inlet of the test section. The liquid is injected
into the test section by a precision syringe pump. The working liquid evaporates under the gas ﬂow
and the vapor-gas mixture ﬂows to the outlet of the gas channel in test section. The vapor-gas mixture
ﬂow at the outlet is measured by a mass ﬂow meter. The liquid temperature in the test section is
determined by the temperature of the substrate base, Which controlled With the help of thermoelectric
module. The position of the interface level is controlled With an accuracy of 10 micrometers using a
Schlieren technique and the syringe pump [2].

Recording of the convective structures in the liquid layer under action of the gas ﬂow is carried out
using the Particle Image Velocimetry (PIV) method. The schematic diagram of the method is shown in
Fig. 2. The method allows to determine the shape, velocity of the vortex structures in the liquid layer
depending on various system parameters such as gas ﬂow velocity, liquid temperature, the height of
the liquid layer, etc. Detailed description of PIV method is given in [10].

Instantaneous two—eomponent velocity ﬁeld is measured in the central cross section of the liquid
layer directed towards the gas ﬂow. In the beginning of the experiment, the particles (tracers) with a
size of 5 microns are added to the liquid. The size and density of the tracers are chosen in such a way
as to avoid the inﬂuence of the particles on the liquid ﬂow pattern. A pulsed laser sheet optics creates
a thin (300 pm) light knife and illuminates small particles. The particles positions at the time of two
consecutive laser ﬂashes are recorded on two frames of a digital camera. The optical axis of the digital
camera was normal to the laser sheet. The ﬂow velocity is determined by calculating a displacement of
the particles during the time between the laser ﬂashes. The determination of the particles displacement
is based on application of correlation methods to the images of a tracer particle using a regular
decomposition into elementary regions. The data processing is carried out using the “AetualFlow”
software program. The program implements two main methods for image processing: the standard and
the iterative eross-eorrelation methods [11]. The standard eross-eorrelation method is based on the
employment of fast Fourier transform using the correlation theorem. However, for a more accurate
calculation of the velocity vector is used an iterative eross-eorrelation method for calculation of two-
eomponent velocity ﬁeld. The basic idea of the method consists in multiple processing of one and the
same area using the result of processing at the previous iteration to estimate the processing parameters
for the next iteration. As a consequence of this approach, it is possible to obtain a signiﬁcant increase
in the accuracy of the obtained data [11]. The eross-eorrelation method is used as the primary method
to calculate two—eomponent velocity ﬁeld.The size of the measuring area corresponds to 1290x272
pixels and 14,2X3 mm, respectively. The size of interrogation area is 32x32 pixels. The time delay
between successive frames is equal to 100 mks.
3. Results and discussion
The experiments were conducted at atmospheric pressure in a test section, and a stationary 3 mm thick
liquid layer. Ethanol was used as the working liquid. The evaporation surface area was 100 1111112 with
the corresponding 10X10 mm eut-out in the plate. The gas ﬂow rate was 1000 ml/min with that
corresponds to gas average velocity to 0.138 m/s (Re=28), respectively. The temperature of the
“liquid-gas” system ranged from 200C to 500C . The difference between the temperature of the gas
and liquid does not exceed 0.1 0C.

Fig. 3 represents a two—eomponent velocity ﬁeld for gas ﬂow rate of 1000 ml/min and for
four “liquid-gas” temperature T: 20, 30, 40, 50, OC, eorrespondently . The calculation of the average
velocity of convective structures is conducted as follows. First, the measuring area with a liquid vertex
is determined Visually. The measuring areas of the vertexes are indicated by red rectangles in Fig. 3.
Next, a rectangular area with this vertex is selected in the “AetualFlow” program. The program
displays a table with the coordinates and velocity projections along the axes X and y for a group of
particles within the small interrogation area inside the measurement area. Extremely low velocity
vectors are removed from the table. Removed vectors are located near borders of the measuring area
and outside of the liquid convective vorteX.The velocity of particles in the interrogation area is
determined by the formula:

V=v((vx>2+(vy>2>
where, VX and Vy — are X and y components of the velocity vector. The velocity of the convective
vertex is calculated as the average value of the all velocitiesin the measuring area.

Figure 3.TW0-eomponent velocity ﬁeld.
Liquid - ethanol.The layer thickness - 3 mm.
Gas ﬂow rate - 1000 ml/min (Vgas=0.138 m/s, Re=28).
Temperature:a) 20 0C; b) 30 0C; e) 40 0C; d) 50 0C.

A two—eomponent velocity ﬁeld at a gas ﬂow rate of 1000 ml/min and gas-liquid temperature 20 0C
is shown in Fig. 3 a). It is found the formation of two symmetrical convective vertexes Within the
liquid layer. The ﬁrst vortex at the initial area of the gas-liquid contact is moving in eounter-eurrent
direction of the gas ﬂow. A strong evaporation at the initial section of the gas-liquid interface leads to
an interfacial temperature gradient. The interfacial temperature gradient due to thermoeapillary effect
induces a eounter-eurrent t0 the gas ﬂow motion of the liquid at the interface. The second vortex
moves in the same direction as the gas ﬂow. This liquid movement occurs due to the action of the gas
shear stress and the effect of the ﬁrst vortex structure. The velocities of the two vertexes are equal and
correspond to 0.241 m/s and the second one corresponds to 0.28 m/s.

When the temperature is increased up to 30 OC and 40 OC(Fig. 4 b, 0) two convective liquidvortexes
Which move in opposite directions relative to each other are alsoobserved. However, there is agrowth
of the vortex velocities for both temperaturewith reference to of 20 0C. For temperature of 30 0C the
velocities of the ﬁrst and second vortex structures are equal to 0.285 and 0.283 m/s, respectively. For
the temperature of 40 OC there is a slight decrease of the velocities relatively temperature of 30 OC.
The velocities of the ﬁrst and second vertexes for temperature of 40 0C are equal to 0.272 m/s and
0.269 m/s, eorrespondently. It can be noted at the temperature rise of the “gas-liquid” system the size
of the ﬁrst convective vertex that moves in opposite direction to the gas ﬂow becomes 1arger.The size
of the second vortex isappropriatelyredueed.Veloeity of the ﬁrst vortex becomes also lager in
comparison to the second one. Future growth of the “gas-liquid” temperature up to 50 0C (Fig. 3, (1)
leads to increase of size of the ﬁrst convective vortex and the second liquid vertex is almost
disappeared. Velocity of the ﬁrst vertex of liquid is reduced to 0.228 111/0.

Most probably, such behaviour of the convective structure Within the liquid is caused by increased
intensity of the evaporation at the interface due to the temperature rise of “gas-liquid” system. More
intensive evaporation can lead to increase of interfacial temperature gradient. The growth of
temperature gradient increases the thermoeapillary forces on the gas-liquid interfaeelt can be
concluded that, one of governing factor determining structure of convective ﬂows Within the liquid is
thethermoeapillaryeffeet.
4. Conclusion
Convection study by PIV method in a horizontal liquid layer evaporating into the gas ﬂow has been
performed. Effect of “gas-liquid” temperature on the convective ﬂows in the liquid layer has been
considered. It is shown that the temperature rise induces signiﬁcant changes in the convective ﬂow
structure. The growth of temperature from 20 OCto 50 OC leads to the expansion of the ﬁrst convective
vortex of the liquid that moves in opposite direction of the gas ﬂow. For the maximum temperature
(50 0C) of the “gas-liquid” system the second convective vortex Whicheireulates in the same direction
With the gas ﬂow is almost disappeared.The main factor determining structure of convective ﬂows
Within the liquid is the thermoeapillary effect.
