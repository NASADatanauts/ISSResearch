Abstract

An experiment designed to measure the atomic oxygen (AO) erosion proﬁle of scattered AC was
exposed to Low Earth Orbital (LEO) A0 for almost four years as part of the Materials International Space
Station Experiment 1 and 2 (MISSE 1 and 2). The experiment was ﬂown in MISSE Passive Experiment
Carrier 2 (PEC 2), Tray 1, attached to the exterior of the International Space Station (188) Quest Airlock.
The experiment consisted of an aperture disk lid of Kapton H (DuPont) polyimide coated on the space
exposed surface with a thin AO durable silicon dioxide ﬁlm. The aperture lid had a small hole in its center
to allow A0 to enter into a chamber and impact a base disk of aluminum. The A0 that scattered from the
aluminum base could react with the under side of the aperture lid which was coated sporadically with
microscopic sodium chloride particles. Scattered AO erosion can occur to materials within a spacecraft
that are protected from direct AO attack but because of apertures in the spacecraft the AO can attack the
interior materials after scattering. The erosion of the underside of the Kapton lid was sufﬁcient to be able
to use proﬁlometry to measure the height of the buttes that remained after washing off the salt particles.
The erosion pattern indicated that peak ﬂux of scattered AO occurred at and angle of approximately 450
from the incoming normal incidence on the aluminum base unlike the erosion pattern predicted for
scattering based on Monte Carlo computational predictions for A0 scattering from Kapton H polyimide.
The effective erosion yield for the scattered AC was found to be a factor of 0.214 of that for direct
impingement on Kapton H polyimide.

1. Introduction

Low Earth orbital (LEO) atomic oxygen (AG) has been well documented to be a durability concern
for spacecraft polymers that are exposed to this environment (refs. 1 through 4). There have been
relatively few investigations of the effects of scattered A0, with minimal actual in-spaee data. (ref. 5).
Scattered A0 is important for assessment of durability of polymers and metals that are not directly
exposed to AD but may receive AO through secondary reﬂection processes. Materials that receive such
scattered AO may be compromised if their function depends upon their structural, optical or surface
conductivity properties. The objective of this effort was to measure the erosion characteristics of AO that
is scattered from typical spacecraft surfaces. To make such measurements, a small AO scattering chamber
was placed in a 2.54 cm diameter sample holder on the MISSE Passive Experiment Carrier 2 (PEC 2),
Tray 1 (Sample Tray E5) on the exterior of the ISS Quest Airlock as part of the MISSE 1 and 2. The
MISSE 2 Tray 1 was exposed primarily to direct ram AO exposure concurrent with solar exposure on-
orbit. The sample was conﬁgured to scatter normally incident AC from an oxidized aluminum surface and
allow it to react with Kapton H polyimide to measure the erosion as a function of ejection angle from the
aluminum scattering surface which is representative of typical spacecraft materials.

2.1 Atomic Oxygen Scattering Chamber
The experiment consisted of three components: a Kapton aperture lid, an aluminum cylindrical spacer
and an aluminum base (see ﬁg. 1). The aperture lid was a 2.54 cm diameter by 0.127 mm thick Kapton H
polyimide disk, which was coated with ~1000 Angstroms 0f SiOz 0n the space exposed surface after ion
beam precleaning its surface prior to coating. The SiOz was applied through ion beam sputter deposition.

"7","3.05 mm diameter hole in the center of it to allow A0 to enter and impinge at normal incidence upon the
base of the chamber. Microscopic salt particles were deposited on the underside of the Kapton lid and
were applied by repetitively sweeping the aperture disk through a fog solution of distilled water saturated
with sodium chloride. The cylindrical aluminum spacer was 6.68 mm tall. The inside wall of the
cylindrical spacer was lined with 0.127 mm thick Kapton H polyimide which was AO textured for the
purpose of creating a rough surface texture that would enhance reaction with diffusely scattered A0 to
minimize additional scattering processes. The aluminum base disk was 0.125 mm thick aluminum. The
aluminum base was not anodized but was exposed to A0 in a plasma asher and hence had a relatively
thick oxide on its surface.

2.2 Experimental Procedures

An Olympus SZH microscope operated with a Canon EOS D30 digital camera was used to document
various features of the sample at magniﬁcations on the order of 10 to 100X. Scanning electron
microscope images were obtained using a Hitachi S-4700 ﬁeld emission scanning electron microscope
(FESEM) operated at an accelerating voltage of 6 kV. The A0 erosion of the inside surface of the
aperture lid was measured by ﬁrst immersing the lid in distilled water to dissolve the salt particles, then
using a Dektak 6M Surface Proﬁler to measure the height of pillars that were protected from A0 erosion
by the salt particles. The radial location of the measured pillars was determined by comparison with the
optical microscope photographs of the pillars.

3. Results and Discussion
3.1 Leo Atomic Oxygen Exposure

The experiment was exposed to the LEO environment for 3.99 years from August 16, 2001 to
July 30, 2005. During this exposure the orientation of the 188 was occasionally changed, however, the
AO ﬂuenoe impinging upon the face of the aperture disk was almost exclusively from a single direction
which was measured to be approximately 8 degrees from normal incidence. The arrival angle was
determined by measuring the inclination relative to the surface normal of undercut oaVities at several
small (~0.01 mm diameter) defect sites in the SiOz protective coating on the aperture disk. All the
undercut oaVities appeared as straight narrow cylinders which were parallel to each other indicating that
the AO had arrived almost exclusively from a single direction. Because the aperture disk is recessed
0.762 mm below the surface of the sample tray (as were all adjoining samples) in the same tray, the AO
arrival was limited to angles of up to 88 degrees from normal.

The A0 ﬂuenoe was measured using two Kapton H witness samples on the same PEG 2 sample tray
(E5). The ﬂuenoe was determined to be 8.43><1021 atoms/om2 based on a Kapton H polyimide density of
1.427 (as measured by a density gradient column) and an erosion yield for Kapton H to be
3.0><10_24 om3/atoms (ref. 6).

3.2 Directed Atomic Oxygen Effects

There is a 2.37 mm wide ring around the outside of the aperture lid that was protected from the space
environment. Microscopic inspection of the SiOz coating showed evidence of mud tile cracks across the
exposed 2.065 cm central area of the disk, with no evidence of cracking in the protected region. The
aperture lid was placed in distilled water for about 1 min to dissolve the salt particles. Immediately after
the water was allowed to evaporate from the disk, it was observed that the SiOz coating had spalled in the
exposed area of the disk as shown in ﬁgure 2(a). Figure 2(b) shows an electron micrograph of the spalled
SiOz coating.

There were numerous small pin window apertures in the SiOz protective coating (defect sites) that
allowed A0 to etch all the way through the aperture lid. The holes etched into the aperture lid were well
deﬁned narrow tunnels indicating that the direction of AO attack on the scattering chamber was well
aligned and unvarying. By microscopic alignment of several undercut tunnels below pin window defects,
it was determined that the AO arrived was from an angle 8° from normal incidence and in a direction as
indicated in ﬁgure 3. This arrival direction was also consistent with a slight amount of asymmetry of the
dark scattered AO ring noticed on the inside surface of the aperture disk as seen in ﬁgures 3(a) and 4.

Figure 4 is a photograph that compares the inside surface of the ﬂight sample aperture lid with a non-
ﬂown control aperture lid.

As can be seen from ﬁgure 4, the ﬂight lid looks quite similar to the control lid with the exception of
a dark ring surrounding the aperture of the ﬂight lid. The salt particles are clearly Visible in the photo. The
actual exposed area of the aperture lid was the central 2.065 cm region of the disk.

particle removal are shown in ﬁgure 5.

Figure 6.—Scanning electron microscope images of salt-protected
buttes on inside surface of the ﬂight aperture lid.

The inner plateau of the salt-protected buttes and the region external to this wall were used for
proﬁlometry comparison to measure the depth of AO erosion as a function of radius from the center of the
aperture lid. Figure 7 shows a plot of the aperture lid AO erosion measurements as a function of radius
from the center of the aperture. This ﬁgure also compares a photograph scaled to match. It is interesting
that the dark ring observed around the aperture does not coincide with the radius of maximum erosion
depth. What is immediately surprising from inspection of ﬁgure 7 is that the most eroded region was not
located closest to the aperture disk as one would expect if the scattering behaved as a cosine distribution.

Integrating the erosion volume over the entire aperture disk predicts a scattered erosion volume of

_4 3 . . . . . .
4.04><10 om . This volume is 0.218 of the eros1on volume which would occur if the aluminum target was
Kapton H polyimide. Thus, some combination of a lower scattered AO ﬂuX and lower energy causes a
reduction in the primary incoming AO effective erosion yield. The effective erosion yield for the scattered

_25 3 . . . . .

AC was found to be 6.42><10 om /atom which is 0.218 of that for direct impingement on Kapton H
polyimide. This reduction in effective erosion yield would probably be different for chemically different

scattered A0 to vary in a similar fashion to the differences between erosion yields in LEO and thermal
energy RF plasma ashers because of a probable high degree 0ftherma1 accommodation for the scattered
AO (Which is discussed later in this paper).

A polar plot of this erosion distribution is shown in ﬁgure 8. This plot corrects the AO proﬁlometry
data for angle of incidence and the squared inverse distance ﬂux relationship for the distance to the center
of scattering site on the aluminum foil. The peak ﬂux of the scattered AO occurs around 45° With very
little ﬂux scattering at less than 30° and at greater than 60° from the normal direction.

"13","3.4 Scattered Atomic Oxygen Erosion Modeling
The angular scattering distribution off the oxidized aluminum base is a much different scattering
distribution function than the cosine or Lambertian distribution that has been found to be optimal when
using Monte Carlo computational modeling to predict erosion of AO scattering off Kapton H polyimide.
Table 1 lists the computational modeling parameters which have been used in the past to replicate AO
erosion of SiOz protected Kapton H (ref. 3). These parameters were used in the Monte Carlo model to
predict scattered AO erosion that would occur on the inside of the ﬂight aperture lid if the oxidized
aluminum behaved as if it was SiOz with a cosine ejection distribution. The results of the erosion
prediction are compared to the measured erosion from the ﬂight sample in ﬁgure 9(a). The Monte Carlo
computational modeling greatly over predicts the amount of AO erosion. By increasing the fractional
energy loss of the AO upon impact in the Monte Carlo model from
28 to 98.9 percent (implying a high degree of thermal accommodation) there is closer erosion agreement
as shown in ﬁgure 9(b). However, the angular distribution of the erosion is too intense at small scattering
angles to properly replicate the erosion pattern. Thus, an angular ejection distribution which peaks at 45°,
rather a cosine based distribution, may potentially improve the comparison between actual and Monte
Carlo predicted erosion with Kapton H.

"15","4. Summary
An experiment was conducted as part of MISSE 1 and 2 to measure the erosion depth proﬁle and

Kapton H effective erosion yield of AO scattering off an oxidized aluminum surface in LEO. The

experiment was ﬂown in the MISSE PEC 2, Tray 1, and was exposed to LEO A0 for a period of almost

four years on the exterior of the ISS Quest Airlock. The experiment consisted of an aperture lid of

Kapton H polyimide coated on the space exposed surface with a thin AO durable ﬁlm of silicon dioxide.

The aperture disk had a small hole in its center to allow A0 to enter into a chamber and impact a base

disk of oxidized aluminum. The A0 that scattered from the aluminum base could react with the under

side of the aperture lid, which was coated sporadically with microscopic sodium chloride particles. The
experiment was exposed to an A0 ﬂuence of 8.43><1021 atoms/cm2 at 8° from normal incidence. The
erosion pattern indicated that the peak ﬂux of scattered AO leaving the oxidized aluminum base occurred
at an angle of approximately 45° from the incoming normal incidence. The ﬂight sample 45° peak ﬂux
dependence was found to be inconsistent with Monte Carlo model predictions for A0 scattering off

Kapton H (as a base), which indicate a cosine dependence of the scattering ﬂux. The effective erosion

yield of the Kapton H for the AO scattered off of oxidized aluminum was found to be 6.54><10_25

c1113 /atom, which is 0.218 of the erosion yield for direct AO impingement on Kapton H polyimide in LEO.

13. ABSTRACT (Maximum 200 words)
An experiment designed to measure the atomic oxygen (A0) erosion profile of scattered AC was exposed to Low Earth
Orbital (LEO) A0 for almost four years as part of the Materials International Space Station Experiment 1 and 2 (MISSE 1
and 2). The experiment was ﬂown in MISSE Passive Experiment Carrier 2 (PEC 2), Tray 1, attached to the exterior of the
International Space Station (188) Quest Airlock. The experiment consisted of an aperture disk lid of Kapton H (DuPont)
polyimide coated on the space exposed surface with a thin AO durable silicon dioxide film. The aperture lid had a small
hole in its center to allow A0 to enter into a Chamber and impact a base disk of aluminum. The A0 that scattered from the
aluminum base could react with the under side of the aperture lid which was coated sporadically with microscopic sodium
Chloride particles. Scattered AO erosion can occur to materials within a spacecraft that are protected from direct AO attack
but because of apertures in the spacecraft the AO can attack the interior materials after scattering. The erosion of the
underside of the Kapton lid was sufficient to be able to use profilometry to measure the height of the buttes that remained
after washing off the salt particles. The erosion pattern indicated that peak ﬂux of scattered AO occurred at an angle of
approximately 450 from the incoming normal incidence 0n the aluminum base unlike the erosion pattern predicted for
scattering based 011 Monte Carlo computational predictions for A0 scattering from Kapton H polyimide. The effective
erosion yield for the scattered AC was found to be a factor of 0.214 of that for direct impingement 0n Kapton H polyimide.
