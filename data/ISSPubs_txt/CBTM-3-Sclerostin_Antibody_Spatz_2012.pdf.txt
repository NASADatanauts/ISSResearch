Context: Animal models and human studies suggest that osteocytes regulate the skeleton’s re-
sponse to mechanical unloading in part by an increase in sclerostin. However, few studies have
reported changes in serum sclerostin in humans exposed to reduced mechanical loading.
Objective: We determined changes in serum sclerostin and bone turnover markers in healthy adult
men undergoing controlled bed rest.
Design, Setting, and Participants: Seven healthy adult men (31 i 3 yr old) underwent 90 d of 6°
head down tilt bed rest at the University of Texas Medical Branch Institute for Translational Sci-
ences-Clinical Research Center.
Outcomes: Serum sclerostin, PTH, vitamin D, bone resorption and formation markers, urinary calcium
and phosphorus excretion, and 24-h pooled urinary markers of bone resorption were evaluated before
bed rest [baseline (BL)] and at bed rest d 28 (BR-28), d 60 (BR-60), and d 90 (BR-90). Bone mineral density
was measured at BL, BR-60, and 5 d after the end of the study (BR+5). Data are reported as mean : 50.
Results: Consistent with prior reports, bone mineral density declined significantly (1—2% per
month) at weight-bearing skeletal sites. Serum sclerostin was elevated above BL at BR-28 (+29 :
20%; P = 0.003) and BR-60 (+42 : 31%; P < 0.001), with a lesser increase at BR-90 (+22 : 21%;
P = 0.07). Serum PTH levels were reduced at BR-28 (—17 : 16%; P = 0.02) and BR-60 (—24 i 14%;
P = 0.03) and remained lower than BL at BR-90 (—21 i 21%; P = 0.14), but did not reach statistical
significance. Serum bone turnover markers were unchanged; however, urinary bone resorption
markers and calcium were significantly elevated at all time points after bed rest (P < 0.01).
Conclusions: In healthy men subjected to controlled bed rest for 90 d, serum sclerostin increased,
with a peak at 60, whereas serum PTH declined, and urinary calcium and bone resorption markers
increased. (J Clin Endocrinol Metab 97: E1736—E1740, 2012)
