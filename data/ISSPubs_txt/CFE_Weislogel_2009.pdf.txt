Abstract
This paper provides a current overview of the in-ﬂight Operations and experimental results of the capillary ﬂow experiment
(CFE) performed aboard the International Space Station (ISS) beginning August 2004 to present, With at least 16 Operations to
date by ﬁve astronauts. CFE consists of siX approximately 1—2 kg experiment units designed to probe certain capillary phenomena
of fundamental and applied importance, such as capillary ﬂow in complex containers, critical wetting in discontinuous structures,
and large length scale contact line dynamics. Highly quantitative Video images from the simply performed experiments provide
direct conﬁrmation of the usefulness of current analytical design tools as well as provide guidance to the development of new
ones. A description of the experiments, crew procedures, performances and status of the data collection and reduction is provided
for the project. The speciﬁc experimental Objectives are brieﬂy introduced by way of the crew procedures and a sample of the
veriﬁed theoretical predictions of the ﬂuid behavior is provided. The potential impact of the ﬂight experiments on the design of
spacecraft ﬂuid systems is discussed in passing.
