Abstract
The Liulin-S experiment is a part of the international project MATROSHKA—R on the Russian segment of the ISS, Which uses a
tissue—equivalent spherical phantom equipped With a set of radiation detectors. The objective of the MATROSHKA—R project is to pro—
Vide depth dose distribution of the radiation ﬁeld inside the sphere in order to get more information on the distribution of dose in a
human body. Liulin—S is a charged particle telescope using three silicon detectors. It measures time resolved energy deposition spectra,
linear energy transfer (LET) spectra, particle ﬂux, and absorbed doses of electrons, protons and heavy ions, simultaneously at three
depths along the radius of the phantom. Measurements during the minimum of the solar activity in cycle 23 show that the average
absorbed daily doses at 40 mm depth in the phantom are between 180 tLGy/day and 220 tLGy/day. The absorbed doses at 165 mm depth
in the phantom decrease by a factor of 1.6—1.8 compared to the doses at 40 mm depth due to the self—shielding 0f the phantom from
trapped protons. The average dose equivalent at 40 mm depth is 590 :l: 32 ttSV/day and the galactic cosmic rays (GCR) contribute at
least 70% of the total dose equivalent at that depth. Shown is that due to the South Atlantic Anomaly (SAA) trapped protons asymmetry
and the direction of Liulin—S lowest shielding zone the dose rates on ascending and descending nodes in SAA are different. The data
obtained are compared to data from other radiation detectors on 188.
