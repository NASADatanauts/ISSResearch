miggitslizsrfness cosmonauts ancl immersion subjects has revealed similarity of responses. However,
changes in OCOR after immersion were noted in only 60% of the subjects, while after
space ﬂight, 90% of cosmonauts showed them. Post—ﬂight changes were more frequent,
marked and long—lasting. Statistical analysis has shown that there were signiﬁcant
differences between pre— and post—ﬂight data according to both parametric and non—
parametric methods of multiple comparisons, whereas only parametric methods have
found signiﬁcant differences within immersion data.
