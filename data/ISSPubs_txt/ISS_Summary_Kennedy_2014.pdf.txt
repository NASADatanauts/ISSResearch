Fig. 7. Loss of blood vessels in the pig dermis after a high skin dose exposure to SPE—like radiation. Pig skin tissue samples were taken pre—irradiation (Panel A) and at 30
days after the pig was exposed to a 10 Gy skin dose of 6 + 12 MeV electron radiation (Panel B). For the skin tissue taken before irradiation, vascular beds are denoted by
squares (Panel A). A consequence of exposure to the high skin dose from SPE radiation is that blood vessels disappear in the areas beneath the epidermis (Panel B), such
that the blood ﬂow to the cells in this area is reduced. Such areas of reduced blood supply beneath the epidermis occur in interventional radiology patients, and are known
to be life—threatening (Balter et a1., 2010; NCRP, 2010). Thus, the areas with reduced blood supply must be removed surgically.
