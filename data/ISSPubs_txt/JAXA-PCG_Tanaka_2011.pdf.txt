Human hematopoietic prostaglandin synthase, one of the better therapeutic
target enzymes for allergy and inﬂammation, was crystallized with 22 inhibitors
and in three inhibitor—free conditions in microgravity. Most of the space-grown
crystals showed better X-ray diffraction patterns than the terrestrially grown
ones, indicating the advantage of a microgravity environment on protein
crystallization, especially in the case of this protein.

The best data of the X-ray diffraction experiments on two to three crystals for each complex of H—PGDS with compound are shown. Data sets were collected up to
the resolution range I/0(I) > 2 and Rmerge < 50%. Data shown in bold face were used for data comparison between space-grown and ground-grown crystals (see text
