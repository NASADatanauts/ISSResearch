We study the compatibility of Alpha Magnetic Spectrometer (AMS-02) data on the cosrniC-ray (CR)
positron fraction with data on the CR electron and positron spectra provided by PAMELA and Fermi LAT.
We do that in terms of a novel propagation model in which sources are distributed in spiral arm patterns in
agreement with astrophysical observations. While former interpretations assumed an unrealistically steep
injection spectrum for astrophysical background electrons, the enhanced energy losses experienced by CR
leptons due to the larger average source distance from Earth allow us to reproduce the data with harder
injection spectra as expected in a shock acceleration scenario. Moreover, we show that in this approach,
and accounting for AMS-02 results, the contribution of nearby accelerators to the ﬂuxes at very high
energy can be signiﬁcantly reduced, thus avoiding any tension with anisotropy upper limits.
