Suspended, slender self—assembled domains of magnetically responsive colloids are observed to buckle
in microgravity. Upon cessation of the magnetic field that drives their assembly, these columns eXpand
aXially and buckle laterally. This phenomenon resembles the buckling of long beams due to thermal
expansion; however, linear stability analysis predicts that the colloidal columns are inherently susceptible
to buckling because they are freely suspended in a Newtonian ﬂuid. The dominant buckling wavelength
increases linearly with column thickness and is quantitatively described using an elastohydrodynamic
model and the suspension thermodynamic equation of state.
