Head-Down TIIt Wlth Lower Body Negatlve Pressure

BACKGROUND: Seven astronauts after 6-mo missions to the International Space Station showed unexpected vision problems. Lumbar
punctures performed in the four astronauts with optic disc edema showed moderate elevations of cerebral spinal ﬂuid
pressure after returning to Earth. We hypothesized that lower body negative pressure (LBNP) imposed during head-
down tilt (HDT) would reduce intraocular pressure (IOP) and transcranial ultrasound pulse amplitude, a noninvasive
intracranial pressure (ICP) surrogate.

METHODS: Participating in this study were 25 normal healthy nonsmoking volunteers (mean age: 36 yr). Subjects were positioned
supine (5 min), sitting (5 min), 15° whole body HDT (5 min), and 10 min of HDT with LBNP (25 mmHg).The order of HDT
and HDT+LBNP tests was balanced. Right and left IOP, transcranial ultrasound pulse amplitude, arm blood pressure, and
heart rate were measured during the last minute (steady state) of each testing condition.

RESULTS: IOP signiﬁcantly decreased from supine to sitting posture by 3.2 i 1.4 mmHg (mean : SD: N = 25), and increased by
0.9 i 1.3 mmHg from supine t0 the HDT position. LBNP during HDT signiﬁcantly lowered IOP to supine levels. In
addition, LBNP signiﬁcantly reduced transcranial ultrasound pulse amplitudes by 38% as compared to the HDT condi-
tion (N = 9). Sitting mean blood pressure (BP) was signiﬁcantly higher (+5 mmHg) than BP values after10 min of LBNP
during HDT. However, heart rate was not signiﬁcantly different across all conditions.
DISCUSSION: These data suggest that short duration exposures to LBNP attenuate HDT—induced increases in IOP and ICP.
KEYWORDS: lower body negative pressure, intraocular pressure, intracranial pressure, vision impairment, spaceﬂight.
