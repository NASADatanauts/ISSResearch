ABSTRACT
The International Space Station (188) presents a signiﬁcant acoustics Challenge considering all Of the modules and
equipment that make it an on-Orbit laboratory workshop and home with long-term crew occupation. This Challenge
is further complicated by the fact that there are numerous suppliers of ISS hardware, including the international
partners. This paper addresses how 188 acoustics are managed to ensure a safe and habitable environment by
establishing requirements, providing oversight and design support, sharing lessons learned and information, testing
for hardware compliance, predicting future acoustic levels, and performing on-Orbit measurements and monitoring
of actual acoustic levels. 188 acoustic requirements are Classiﬁed in three categories by the type of hardware
involved: modules; payloads, and Government Furnished Equipment. The current status of overall ISS acoustics for
each of these hardware categories will be discussed. In addition, examples will be discussed where NASA design
support was used to aid in Obtaining compliance, where difﬁculties were encountered, and where areas of concern
were addressed.
1. INTRODUCTION
The International Space Station (188) is an on-Orbit laboratory workshop and a home with long-term crew
occupation. Mission duration for the crews in 188 is currently from four months nominally to six months maximum.
The 188 acoustics environment is important to maintain at reasonable levels from a standpoint of crew safety
(temporary or permanent hearing loss), crew comfort and habitability, communications between crew and the
ground and among each other, and crew performance. The 188 presents a signiﬁcant acoustics Challenge because of
obvious difﬁculties with controlling a number of connected, Operating modules with payloads and equipment to
perform ISS functions and experiments, sustaining crew, and keeping them in good physical condition. Modules
have equipment such as fans, pumps, compressors, avionics, and other noise producing hardware or systems to serve
their functional and life support needs. Payload racks with Operating equipment create continuous or intermittent
noises, or combinations of both. Payload rack contributions to the total on-Orbit noise can be and has been shown to
be signiﬁcant. Payload racks 0r sub-raek payloads are added or Changed out over time. The crew exercises on a
treadmill and with other conditioning devices, which generate noise. Communications between crew and ground,
which are raised to communicate over the background environment, adds to the overall crew noise exposure. The
crewmernbers have to work and live in the resultant acoustic environment. The acoustics Challenge is further
complicated by the fact that there are numerous suppliers of ISS modules, hardware, and payloads from across and
outside the United States. Management becomes more intricate by resolving variations in documentation of the
requirements, ensuring that the requirements are consistent and appropriate, reconciling differences in planning and
oversight to ensure that the hardware is designed to meet requirements, and coordinating the design experiences and
approaches.
This paper addresses how 188 acoustics are managed to ensure a safe and habitable environment. Included are the
management and technical structure; the current 188 module, payload and Government Furnished Equipment (GFE)
requirements; oversight provision and design support; lessons learned and information shared; hardware compliance

measurements; and acoustic compliance status of ISS modules. Predictions of future acoustic levels; on-orbit
measurements; and monitoring of actual acoustic levels are covered in a separate paper by Allen and Goodman [1].
2. IMPORTANCE OF CONTROLLING NOISE TO ACCEPTABLE LEVELS
There are three basic criteria that should be met by the acoustics levels throughout the 18$: (1) they must not present
a health hazard to the crew; (2) they should not present any signiﬁcant impact or degradation on crew performance
and operations; and (3) they should provide a habitable, comfortable work and sleep environment. Crew health
hazards of most concern are temporary or permanent hearing loss, although other psychological or physiological
effects can be signiﬁcant. Crew performance concerns include inability to effectively communicate and understand
what is being said or what is going on around them (e.g., intelligibility, speech interference, inability to hear alarms
or other important auditory cues such as an equipment item malfunctioning, inability to concentrate, strain in vocal
cords). A STS—40 Shuttle crew member reported ending up with headaches, constant gritting of teeth and furrowing
of brow, and indicated that noise was very difﬁcult to deal with all day and night. [2] Because of concerns with the
effects of high noise levels, early in 1992, the Shuttle Acoustics Working Group and the Astronaut Ofﬁce conducted
tests in varying dBA exposures while performing simulated Orbiter ﬂight deck operational tasks. [3] Astronauts
commented that 70 dBA was a level where: ear protection was recommended; communications were more difﬁcult,
but acceptable for 1-2 hours a day; levels were at the limit for normal speech; levels were fatiguing, but tolerable for
multiple brief periods; and this level was initially irritating. At the 75 dBA level: levels were tolerable for 10-20
minutes maximum and hearing protection was required; levels were very loud from a communications standpoint
and it was difﬁcult to concentrate; recommend limit to one or two hour periods of exposure; and level inhibits
communications and requires raised voice. Note that these tests took place in a simulated Orbiter rnid-deek area and
were related to Shuttle ﬂight duration. In May 2000, the Washington Post reported, “The noise problem is more
serious, in the View of some. It eXists not only on the orbiting Zarya module, but also on the service module awaiting
launch. Clattering fans and other systems create a 75 -decibel racket that rivals that of City trafﬁc and could cause
health problems for crews over the long term. Analysts also warn that excessive noise can dangerously mask other
problems, such as the hiss of an air leak.” [4]
A recent example of problems with hearing signals on 188 is with difﬁculties in hearing an atmospheric monitoring
device’s low battery warning signal. Inability to communicate or understand voice or signals could result in loss of
science or have serious consequences, if the information was important. A habitable environment is important to
ensure proper crew rest, relaxation, and health. These concerns are sometimes considered in descending priority,
although crew performance and operations can lead to more serious Circumstances, including problems with the
mission or crew health. One of the ﬁrst 188 erewrnernbers related that communications were the biggest acoustic
concern. The World Health Organization (WHO) indicated the following about noise: “Noise can cause hearing
impairment, interfere with communication, disturb sleep, cause cardiovascular and psycho-physiologieal effects,
reduce performance, and provoke annoyance responses and Changes in social behavior. The main social
consequence of hearing impairment is the inability to understand speech in normal conditions, which is considered a
severe social handicap.” [5]
Noise Criterion (NC) curves are used to establish safe and comfortable acoustic levels in rooms and workplaces
where people have reasonable communications, including good intelligibility. NASA- Manned Spacecraft Center
(MSC) (now the J ohnson Space Center) originally speciﬁed NC-50 to be the integrated systems requirement for the
continuous noise limits during all manned spacecraft. [6] In the Shuttle Orbiter Prograrn, attempts were made to not
exceed the NC-50 level, but a speciﬁcation level in octave bands equivalent to NC- 63 (assuming the worst case
limit in an octave band deﬁnes the NC value) and 68 dBA were settled on for Orbital Flight Test for the rnid-deek.
This level was later adopted in the Shuttle Program for all elements including the Orbiter rnid-deek and ﬂight deck,
and Spaeelab module. Measurements on Orbiters revealed acoustic levels ranging from 61 to 64 dBA. Since crews
normally spent 10 to 14 days in space these levels were accepted.
The 188 started out with the NC-50 requirement, but this ended up to be for modules only, with payloads and any
GFE covered by their own requirements. Generally, payloads are limited to a module complement level of NC-48,
so full up continuous integrated systems noise beearne controlled to the combination of NC-50 for modules plus the
NC-48 for the payload complement. The combination of NC-50 and NC-48 is termed herein the NC-52 total
speciﬁcation. This results in a derived systems limit curve of this combination, which carries a value of 60 dBA
(versus 58 dBA for NC-50). (Figure 1) Studies and assessments made during Shuttle development and the early 18$

program indicated that NC-50 was a good limit for full up systems. However, the overriding View was that module
suppliers in ISS were not providing or controlling the payloads or GFE, and therefore should not be responsible for
ensuring NC-50 compliance with inclusion of this hardware. The NC-50 plus NC-48 systems derived requirement
has been challenged as too restrictive, and recently the ISS Program, has asked an Independent Assessment Team to
reView the ISS Acoustic requirements to determine if requirements are too stringent and can be relaxed. Response to
the ISS was that current requirements are good and appropriate. These requirements have not been changed, but
there always seem to be questions about whether we could allow higher levels and if so, what would they do to crew
hearing loss and performance.
There has been a lot of discussion about the need to concentrate on hearing protection and conservation for ISS
crews. This is necessary because the noise dosage and levels in some locations are excessive, but the best and
primary method to obViate hearing loss should be to establish good standards for acoustic levels and ensure their
compliance (keep the noise at reasonable levels). The MSC Standard [6] was intended to control levels, such as to
preclude the need to wear hearing protection during normal work and sleep. Hearing protection provisions need to
be available in event noise levels get too high and especially for use during short—term operations, such as the
actuation of module equalization or depressurization valves. Even wearing hearing protection might introduce other
complications, e.g., discomfort caused by wearing them (pressure points, irritability); possible ear infection
(especially with plug type devices); and irnpeded/cornplicated communications when deVices are kept in place, have
to be removed, or set aside. The author is concerned that availability of hearing protection makes it too easy to allow
higher noise levels because the hearing protection safeguards can be called on to remedy the situation and can be
used to alleviate efforts to quiet hardware.
3. ISS ACOUSTIC REQUIREMENTS
Acoustical noise requirements need to be setup early in a program, be treated as requirements, and compliance
watched over and assured. A lesson learned in the Shuttle Program was that limits must be applied to the speciﬁc
hardware that goes into modules, to ensure control of the resultant levels and give the hardware a standard to comply
with. The MSC Design Standard 145 [6] referred to earlier speciﬁed an integrated systems level only, and did not
effectively sub-allocate requirements to hardware that made up the system. As a result, some hardware items used
the systems limits for lack of any deﬁnition of hardware requirements and because these limits were higher and
easier to meet. To ensure that the overall full-up system noise is controlled, it was determined that all elements
contributing to the systems noise had to have appropriate limits. A summary of ISS acoustic limits for all ISS
rnodules, payloads, and Government Furnished Equipment (GFE), is shown in Table l and 2. Similar limits for the
US. Segment modules are shown in Figurel, which were derived from the basic requirements of SSP 41000 [7].
Russian Segment speciﬁcation limits for modules are shown relative to NC curves, Figure 2 and documented in
Table 3. Payloads and GFE requirements contain deﬁnitions for continuous and intermittent noise. A continuous
noise source is a signiﬁcant noise source, which eXists for a cumulative total of 8 hours or more in any 24-hour
period; and an intermittent noise source is a signiﬁcant noise source, which eXists for a cumulative total of less than
8 hours in any 24-hour period.
Intermittent noise limits for payload racks are shown in Table 1. Similar limits apply to GFE. There are no US.
Segment module intermittent noise lirnits, because these limits were thought to be implemented better on payload
and GFE hardware which is either in deﬁned locations in the modules or can be controlled by crew operations, if
necessary. Also, the module surrounds the crew and noise can come from a multitude of uncontrolled locations. The
Russian Segment includes intermittent noise limits relative to full up systems operation, as shown in Table 4. These
Russian requirements deal with the permissible increase in the overall system levels and thus are not applied to the
hardware, but their result on the environment. If there are several items on-board that are interrnittent, then there is
no sub-allocation deﬁned for indiVidual hardware items. The other concern with these limits is when noise levels are
at these limits most of the time, then the crew would have to vacate the area, since the limits would dictate the crew
vacate the module.
4. MANAGEMENT, SUPPORT OF DESIGN/DEVELOPMENT, AND COMPLIANCE
NASA J ohnson Space Center (J SC) has an Acoustics Ofﬁce managing and working the following areas: acoustics
requirements; ISS and hardware oversight; participation in the design process (design and development) of
hardware; hardware emission testing; hardware compliance with requirements; acoustic consultation; providing
materials information to hardware groups and International Partners; working resolution of which payloads should
be manifested together on a future mission; evaluating the acceptability of acoustics from a ﬂight readiness

standpoint for each ﬂight or a group of ﬂights (called an Increment in 188); disposition of waivers/eXCeptions; and
mission monitoring and support. The four areas concentrated on are modules, payloads, GFE, and the integration of
all hardware in a Module. A prime obj eetive of this group is to ensure noise levels from modules and hardware
within them are compliant with the established requirements, which in turn should ensure a safe and habitable
environment.
At times when hardware items are shown to be in need of design or consultant support, or in serious non-
compliance, special focus and efforts are marshaled to help remedy the situation. Examples of these efforts are:
quieting an Airlock Module depressurization pump and develop a heat exchanger mufﬂer; developing mufﬂer
approaches for Express Racks and recommending their implementation; supporting efforts to quiet the Micro-
graVity Glove Box, a German provided payload; supporting efforts to test and quiet the Minus Eighty-degree
Laboratory Freezer (MELFI) payload rack and provide materials to support initial ﬂight hardware needs; developing
a mufﬂer design for the Russian Functional Cargo Block Module; developing fan wrap and mufﬂer design concepts
to support Russian fan quieting; providing design and materials support of the Temporary Early Sleep Station which
is now being used in 188; developing a Noise Abatement Kit for 188 use; and numerous other design support and
consultation efforts. These efforts were intended to, and have aided, the hardware to obtain compliance.
An Acoustics Working Group (AWG), Chaired by the Acoustics Ofﬁce is made up of representatives from the
following organizations: 188 Program Ofﬁce; the Astronaut Ofﬁce; Payload Engineering & Integration Ofﬁce; the
Space Medicine and Health Care Systems Ofﬁce; and Boeing acoustics and payloads support. Representatives from
other areas are also included as required, for example the Marshall Space Flight Center acoustics specialists are
often included in discussions. The functions of this group are: to serve as a focal point for J SC acoustics; reView all
aspects of the ISS acoustic environment; reView acoustic effects on the crew, deterrnine safety issues related to
acoustics; establish and resolve an individual or group position on concerns, waivers/eXCeptions, and provide
recommendations to the 188 Program; perform oversight and support to the 18$.
5. STATUS OF COMPLIANCE OF MODULES AND WITH FULL-UP SYSTEMS
Recent ﬂight data taken in the US Segment is shown in Figure 3. The US. Laboratory when ﬁrst ﬂown exceeded
the NC-SO module requirement and initially was waived predicated on planned modiﬁcation of three hardware
items: the pump package assembly (PPA), the Carbon Dioxide Removal Assembly (CDRA) and the medium rate
outage recorder (MCOR). The CDRA and MCOR have been modiﬁed, and the PPA modiﬁcation is now under
assessment. The US. Lab is reasonably close to the total module systems requirement of NC- 52 (Figure 1), except
it has been higher in the aft end of the module. Bay 6 levels are shown high. The Node and Airlock are shown to be
at acceptable levels.
The Russian Segment consists of the Functional Cargo Block (FGB), Service Module (SM), and the Docking
Compartment (D.C.). Measurements taken in these modules are shown (Figure 5). These modules exceed the
Russian Segment speciﬁcation limits. (Table 3). A waiver has been granted for the FGB and an exeeedanee has been
granted to the DC. The SM compliance has been waived, with the intent to implement modiﬁcations as soon as
feasible. The SM levels, although improved by modiﬁcations, are still excessively high. Additional SM on-orbit
measurement data in various locations are shown (Figures 6, 7). Results of acoustic dosimeter measurements of the
crew exposure (tirne-weighted average) and levels measured at ﬁxed module locations are shown in Table 5.
The acoustic levels measured in ground testing of other international partner (1P) modules are shown in Figure 8.
Levels in these modules are expected to be acceptable.
6. LESSONS LEARNED
A summary of lessons learned in the 188 are as follows: noise requirements for programs need to well founded, and
specify full up systems limits and limits for hardware types provided; acoustics needs to be dealt with early in the
design process; acoustics requirements need to be treated seriously as requirements, not goals; complicated hardware
systems like modules and payload racks, need to implement acoustical noise control plans that layout items such as
identiﬁcation and rating of all noise sources, proposed development and veriﬁcation testing; and an appropriate level
of consulting, design support, and oversight needs to be applied ; and common testing and veriﬁcation needs to be

applied for all 188 modules; a small team of experienced personnel, such as the NASA acoustics team has numerous
advantages and beneﬁts to the 18$.
7. AREAS OF CONCERN
This writer’s experience is that not until 188, did acoustics gain adequate acceptance or attention as a technical
discipline, compared to other standard technical areas, such as structures, thermal control, environmental control,
and others. Early attention to acoustics is necessary in design of ISS hardware, especially considering the
complexity of modules and payloads.[8]. Attending to acoustics early and being proactive better ensures compliance
and minimizes expenditures and schedule impacts. A relatively small group such as the Acoustics Ofﬁce has been
effective in taking proactive steps to help hardware suppliers achieve compliance [9, 10, 11, 12 and 13]. Utilizing a
team such as this is effective from a cost standpoint, helps ensure compliance, minimizes schedule impacts, and
maintains a valuable knowledge and technical capability for hardware suppliers and for the technical base of
NASA’s space program.
The tendency is to consider hearing loss in evaluations of excessive levels, rather than communications and
habitability, as noted earlier. The Navy, in their Guide for Crew Habitability for Ships, [14] calls out the following
noise criteria. To meet normal and high standards (termed HAB+): cabin, state roorns, berthing and sanitary space
levels shall not exceed a maximum acceptable noise level of 50 dBA. Navigation and control rooms, including
wheelhouse, pilothouse, Chart roorn, radio and radar rooms, and ships ofﬁces. However, this guide also includes
maximum acceptable sound pressure levels, as follows: cabin, stateroorns, berthing and sanitary spaces levels shall
not exceed the “maximum acceptable level” of 80 dBA navigation and control spaces listed above are allowed a
maximum of 85 dBA. The areas where communications are important only goes up to 55 dBA, an increase 5 dBA
from normal and high standards. (limits for communications are especially important and are not granted rnueh
leeway when standards are eased). NC-50 is equivalent to 58 dBA and the modiﬁed NC-52 is equivalent to 60 dBA.
According to NASA-STD-3000, “for satisfactory communication of most voice messages in noise, 75%
intelligibility is required” [15]. NASA-STD-3 000 also indicates that the 75 % value falls within the lower part of the
very good to Excellent range of intelligibility (range is 0.7 to 1.0) Using this 75% ﬁgure and data from a 1975 report
by Pearsons, the maximum noise environment level would be NC-5 0.2 to obtain this level of intelligibility when
using normal voice level at 5-8 feet distances between crew [16]. In this report NC-5 5 noise level would drop the
intelligibility to 30%. These references indicate our 188 speciﬁcations are allowing some loss in intelligibility, and
measured levels in the Service Module shown above, are of concern. The World Health Organization (WHO) in one
report [17], gives guideline values for industrial, commercial, shopping and trafﬁc areas, indoors and outdoors as 70
dBA for a 24 hour time base (exposure). The listed critical health effect is hearing impairment. In addition to the
Shuttle data on dBA we have discussed in Section 2, we have Russian Mir program results, which show signiﬁcant
hearing loss on long duration missions. This information and previous discussion indicates that levels at or close to
70 dBA should be considered 188 daily eXposure limits and that SM levels measured and documented in Table5 are
problematic. It is frequently discussed that long- term studies are required to substantiate limits. This author’s
opinion is that these limits are justiﬁed in View of crew experience noted herein, especially considering the
variability in crew member physiological and psychological response to noise.
8. CONCLUDING REMARKS
The 188 presents numerous Challenges in acoustics. J SC’s Acoustics Ofﬁce and the AWG perform valuable
management oversight over acoustic activities. The J SC acoustics team provides beneﬁcial support of module,
payloads, and GFE requirements deﬁnition, design and development, consultation, and applies proactive efforts to
help hardware providers achieve compliance. The acoustic team also manages predictions for ﬂight readiness, on-
orbit measurements, and maintains a database of measurements, and distributes reports and assessments of the data.
It is important that the ISS noise be in compliance with current speciﬁcations. This is important to ensure acceptable
crew communications, health, and well-being. The communications aspect of ISS acoustics needs to be further
addressed. Current 188 Module meet or are Close to meeting the NC-52 deﬁned in this document. The acoustic
levels in the Russian Segment are high, but acceptable considering crew operations. The SM levels and crew
eXposure readings are too high, and further effort is needed to lower them.
