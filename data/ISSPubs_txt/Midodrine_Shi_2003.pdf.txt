Temazepam, but Not Zolpidem, Causes Orthostatlc Hypotens1on

1n Astronauts After Spaceﬂight

Summary: Insomnia is a common symptom, not only in the adult population
but also in many astronauts. Hypnotics, such as ternazeparn (a benzodiaze—
pine) and zolpidem (an imidazopyridine), are often taken to relieve insomnia.
Ternazeparn has been shown Clinically to have hemodynamic side effects,
particularly in the elderly; however, the mechanism is not Clear. Zolpidern
does not cause hemodynamic side effects. The purpose of this study was to
determine whether the use of different hypnotics during spaceﬂight might
contribute significantly to the high incidence of postflight orthostatiC hypo—
tension, and to compare the findings in astronauts with Clinical research.
Astronauts were separated into three groups: control (n = 40), ternazeparn (15
or 30 mg; n = 9), and zolpidem (5 or 10 mg; n = 8). In this study, ternazeparn
and zolpidern were only taken the night before landing. The systolic and
diastolic blood pressures and heart rates of the astronauts were measured
during stand tests before spaceﬂight and on landing day. On landing day,
systolic pressure decreased significantly and heart rate increased significantly
in the ternazeparn group, but not in the control group or in the zolpidern group.
Ternazeparn may aggravate orthostatiC hypotension after spaceﬂight when
astronauts are hemodynamically compromised. Ternazeparn should not be the
initial Choice as a sleeping aid for astronauts. These results in astronauts
may help to eXplain the hemodynamic side effects in the elderly who are
also compromised. Zolpidern may be a better Choice as a sleeping aid in
these populations. Key Words: Astronaut—Orthostatic hypotension—
Spaceﬂight—Temazeparn—Zolpidern.
