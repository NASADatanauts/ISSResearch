Abstract

This is a report on the status of the particle telescope Liulin—S developed for investigation of the radiation environment dynamics
within the Russian spherical tissue—equivalent phantom 0n the International Space Station (ISS). Liulin—S experiment will be a part
of the international project MATROSHKA—R on ISS and is planned to start in 2007. Its aim is a long—term investigation of the
depth—dose distribution in the phantom, mounted in the Russian Segment of ISS. The instrument is capable of simultaneously measuring
energy deposition spectra, linear energy transfer (LET) spectra, ﬂux and dose rates for electrons, protons and heavy charged particles at
different depths of the phantom’s radial Channel. Dose equivalent rate will be calculated from the absorbed dose rate multiplied by qual—
ity factor Q(LET).

We present the inter—calibration results of the Liulin—S instrument exposure to heavy ions, at the National Institute of Radiological
Sciences (NIRS), Chiba, J apan that was done as part of the ICHIBAN project. The inter—comparison with the radiation dosimeters and
spectrometers resulted in deﬁnition of the sensitive volumes of the instrument’s silicon detectors as well as estimations of the LET range
of the Liulin-S instrument.
