Thermal convection in a spherical shell represents an important model in ﬂuid dynamics and geophysics.-
Investigations on thermal convective instabilities occuring in the spherical gap ﬂow under terrestrial conditions are
of basic importance especially for the understanding of symmetry-breaking bifurcations during the, transition to
chaos. Microgravity experiments on thermal convection with a simulated central force ﬁeld are important for the
understanding of large scale geophysical motions as the convective transport phenomena in the Earth's liquid outer
core. This report summarizes the Concurrent experimental (part I), numerical (part H) and theoretical (part III)
studies for the preparation of an International Space Station (IS S) experiment inside the Fluid Science Laboratory
(F SL). This special experimental device with respect to geophysical simulations is called GEOFLOW. A central
symmetric force ﬁeld similar to the gravity ﬁeld acting on planets can be produced using the effect of the
dielectrophoretic force ﬁeld by applying a high voltage potential difference to the inner and outer sphere. Flow

INTRODUCTION
Thermal convection in a spherical shell under a central force ﬁeld represents an important model in ﬂuid
dynamics, astro- and geophysics (Busse, 1970 and 1975; Busse and Riahi, 1982; Cardin and Olsen, 1992, 1994,
and 1995; Cam'gan and Busse, 1983; Cordero and Busse, 1992; Harder and Christensen, 1996; Liu et al., 2000;
Roberts, 1968;""Zhang, 19,92). The large seale motions of atmospheres of planets and in the convection zones of
rotating stars are Strongly inﬂuenced by Coriolis forces (due to rotation) and by buoyancy forces (due to gravity),
which drive thermal circulation. The resulting ﬂow structures show a rich variety of different types of instabilities,
which depend strongly on different parameters as rotation rate, temperature gradient, gap width, material functions
and others. The model of a spherical gap ﬂow experiment should help to understand such phenomena as the zanal
_ bands of Jupiter, the origin of extremely high winds in the tropics and subtropics- of Jupiter, Saturn and Neptune,
the persistent differential rotation of the Sun, the complex patterns of convection in the slowly-rotating mantle of
' the Earth, and the rapidly rotating ﬂows in the Earth’s core. Figure 1 shows a schematic cross section of the Earth.
The convective motions of the molten iron alloy in the outer core generate the main geomagnetic ﬁeld.
Microgravity experiments 9n thermal convection with a simulated central dielectrophoretic force ﬁeld are important
for the understanding of these large scale geophysical motions (Hart et al., 1986; Yavorskaya et al., 1984). An
experimental set-up is performed to investigate the problems of thermal convection in the ﬂuid shell between two
concentric spheres with and without rotation and also with differentially rotating spheres. A central symmetric force
> ﬁeldsimilar to the gravity ﬁeld acting on planets can be produced by applying a high voltage between the inner and
outer sphere using the effect of the dielectrophoretic force ﬁeld (Pohl; 1978). To turn off the unidirectional
gravitation under terrestrial conditions, these experiments require an environment of microgravity. In preparation of
long-term experiments in space, several experiments have been performed under laboratory conditions as well as

preparation of the experiments, linear stability analysis has been performed to determine the critiCal Rayleigh and

Taylor numbers for the onset of thermal convection under a simulated central force ﬁeld. _

Nonlinear ﬁnite-amplitude convective motions have been studied numerically. Further experiments with
different gap widths and supercritical up to turbulent Taylor and Rayleigh numbers of the order of thereal
geophysical parameters need a microgravity time of days or weeks, i.e. experiments in the Experiment
Container of the Fluid Science Lab of the 188.

In section 2 we describe the scientiﬁc programme for the GEOFLOW experiments. Design and layout

constrains of the FSL and the EC as well as the Experiment Container (EC) design and the diagnostics

prepared for the GEOFLOW experiment are _ presented in section 3 and 4. Preparatory studies and the

experimental methods are described in section 5.

SCIENTIFIC PROGRAMME FOR MICROGRAVITY EXPERIMENTS '

The purpose of these experiments under microgravity with central force ﬁeld is to investigate the stability,
pattern formation and nansition to turbulence in thermally driven rotating ﬂuids, based on complementary
experimental, theoretical and numerical studies of the ﬂow of a viscous incompressible ﬂuid between concentric
coaxially rotating spheres. We plan to focus on wide and medium gaps. In thick layers, in which the. radius of the
outer sphere is considerably larger thah that of the inner sphere, the geophysical application is the ﬂow in planet’s
interior. The atmospheric motion of the giant planets takes place in medium gaps. ‘

The main objectives are: ' ‘ .

— to study experimentally the stability of the basic state aha its transition and to determine the characteristics of
the ﬂow. In the project the supercritical Rayleigh number of the experiment should be detected. The. stability
diagram for the different states should be measured. Also states of hysteresis could be inquired. The energy
transport from inner sphere to outer sphere should be measured. The characteristic wave numbers and
frequencies should be determined. The inﬂuence of boundary layers or inertial layers should bedetected.

— to compare theoretical predictions for the ﬂow pattern bifurcating from trivial state, with the experiments. In the
nonrotating spherical shell we expect polygon pattern of the ﬂow ﬁeld, i. e. tetrahedral symmetry for radius ratio
11 = 0.4 or cubic symmetry for radius ratio n = 0.45 (Chossat, 1999).

--. to compare experimental and numerical results to elucidate the physical mechanisms of instability and to
understand the physical mechanisms of ﬂow instability fer different Taylor numbers (Liu et al., 2000).

- to draw comparisons between the experimental results of the ﬂow in wide spherical shells with theoretical work
on the ﬂow in the Earth’s interior. '

- to describe the transition to turbulence in distributed systems (in spherical systems: plane convection at the pole,
cylindrical convection at the equator), to study the dependence on meridional coordinate.

— to study the changes of the transition scenarios to chaos and of the attractor characteristics when the parameters
are changing (aspect ratio, Taylor number, Prandtl number) (Wulf et al., 1999).

- to investigate the occurrence of complex time-dependent behaviour (e.g. intetmittent-like) near onset of
convection, for radius ratios close to critical values.

- to set-up experiments where a forced symmetryubreaking imperfection is introduced in the system, and compare
its effect with theoretical predictions (Chossat, 1975 and 1999; Chossat and Guyard, 1994 and 1996; Chossat et
al., 1990 and 1999).

- to compare the theoretically predicted bifurcation scenarios with experimentally (LDV-) measured ones (Wulf et
al., 1999). 0

THE FLUID SCIENCE LABORATORY (FSL) - '

The Fluid Science Laboratory (F SL) is a part in the european Columbus Orbital Facility (COF) of the
International Space Station (188) as illustrated in ﬁgure 2. The FSL supports scientific microgravity research in the
ﬁeld of ﬂuid physics by means of speciﬁc triggering and observation of phenomena inside of transparent and at the
surface of opaque media. It is characterised by a high level of modularity on all experiment and facility (sub-

‘)system levels. Speciﬁc control and data processing modes allow for quasi real time experiment operation.

Figure 4. GEOFLOW Experiment Container: Adaption optics (up) and spherical shell system mounted i
on a rota tra (down) for the inte; ation into the F SL ~

The experimental cell is formed by an outer glass sphere, which can be cooled, and an inner sphere, which can
be uniformly heated from within. Both spheres can be rotated as a rigid body on a rotating tray inside the container.
Thermal convective pattern occur due to the interaction of rotational and density effects. The central force ﬁeld is
generated by applying a high voltage of 10 kV between inner and outer sphere to generate the central symmetric
body force ﬁeld analogous to the earth’s gravity ﬁeld. Due to the action of the high voltage potential on the ﬂuid in
the gap it would be desirable to use an optical observation technique for ﬂow visualization and temperature

measurements without tracer particles, i.e. the Schlieren—fShadowgraph or Interferometry method. For that pupose,
an adaption optics is integrated into the container as illustrated in ﬁgure 4.
At the time, three different inner radii (R1) are possible to vary the radius ratio. As working ﬂuid silicone oils with
different viscosities are used to investigate the inﬂuence of the Prandtl nuniber. For ﬁthher experiments it is
possible to rotate both spheres in the same or different direction. Thus, four parameters can be adjusted by the
experimental set-up: '
Rayleigh-number: Ra = (0L geld3 AT)/(Kv), 103 < Ra < 107
Prandtl-number: Pr = V/K Pr = 8.44, Pr = 37.5 and Pr = 100 have been
realized (depending on the test ﬂuid)
Radius ratio: 11 = RI/R2 0.34 S n s 0.6
Reynolds-number: Re = (R120l )/v, 0 < Re < 105
For experiments with a central force ﬁeld based on the dielectrophoretic effect,.the outer sphere has to be coated
inside with a thin layer of a semiconductor material.

EXPERIMENTAL METHODS AND DIAGNOSTICS
Interferometry And Schlieren [Shadowgraph Techniques
The Schlieren method and the Interferometry are well known methods for ﬂow Visualization and temperature
measurements, although these methods have been rarely used for ﬂow visualization in spherical geometry. Figure 5
shows a sketch of the principle set-up of a Wollaston Shearing Interferometer in backscatter arrangement which is
used for the runnm' g investigations on a plane cavity. If the Wollaston Prism is replaced by a pinhole, a slit or
another aperture, the shown assembly can be used to execute Schlieren visualization (Egbers, 1999).
The Schlieren method depends on the deﬂection of a ray of light from its undisturbed path, when it passes
through a. medium with a density gradient which implements a reﬁactive gradient, that leads to a curvature of the
ray. The cu'rVature of the ray is proportional to the gradient. Though if parallel rays of light are sent through a
transmissive medium with variable density, the rays will be deﬂected differently in areas of different density.

The rays can also experience a phase shift. The Interferometry uses the phase shift by interfering two coherent rays
from which one has passed the test cell. The displacement of the two rays is proportional to the density variation.
Therefore both visualization methods show different information about the observed ﬂow. The Schlieren method
reproduces a pattern which is proportional to the observed ﬂow. In principle, it shows mainly the ﬁrst derivative of
the temperature gradient, whereas the Wollaston Shearing Interferometry gives an image of the gradient. Another

"
"8","178 C. Egbers et a1.
important difference between both methods of visualization is that the Interferometry is much more sensible than
the Schlieren method, which in the end leads to demand a much higher quality of all optical components than
would be necessary for the Schlieren optic. First investigations have been made on a plane cavity in a laboratory
based experiment. These investigations have been done to verify if schlieren or interferometric diagnostic methods
can generally be used to visualize weak convective ﬂows. The experiments have proved that temperature gradients
of 2 Kelvin and more can easily be visualized, which signiﬁes that the temperature gradients of 10 Kelvin planned
for the GEOFLOW experiment can be visualized (Egbers, 1999).
Flow Visualization Technique And PIV—Technique

Because the expected ﬂow structures occuring in the spherical Couette ﬂow during the laminar-mrbulent
transition are non—axisymmetric and in some cases non-equatorially symmetric, both for thermal and isoﬂaermal
ﬂow, it is necessary to use an observation-technique, which provides simultanebusly ﬂow visualization of both the
azimuthal and the meridional ﬂow. Therefore, a combination of the following two visualization methods is. used:
To investigate the ﬂow structures occurring in the meridional cross-section of the spherical annulus, a light sheet
illumination technique is employed as illustrated in figure 6. In addition, a system with a ﬁber-optic is applied to
visualize the polar region with the azimuthal waves. In this way, the cellular structure of the occuring vortices in the
meridional plane as well as the azimuthal and polar behavior of the arising ﬂow pattern can be obtained (Egbers,
and Rath, 1995); Photographs or prints from video-records were taken. The pictures were taken with a CCD-camera
and digitized by a frame grabber facility. The difference of the gray values between a picture of an instability and a
reference picture of the basic ﬂow is calculated, ampliﬁed and pseudo colored for each pixel to maintain only the
structures of the instability (Wulf et a1., 1999). This kind of ﬂow visualization technique gives a global, but
qualitative view of the ﬂow structures. '
Integrated Miniaturized LDV Measuring Technique

Laser Doppler VelOcimetry (LDV) is a well known non-invasive diagnostic technique in ﬂuid research on
ground for highly» precise velocity measurements. As common LDV-systems use gas lasers and have extensive
devices they arehnot suitable for the use in a microgravity environment. However, new developments in laser diode
based optics allow the application of miniaturized LDV-devices, so that they become practical for the integration on
Experiment—Container' level of the Fluid Science Lab (FSL) as illustrated in ﬁgure 7 for the GEOFLOW
experiment. ,

Local velocity measurements will be carried out using an autonomous miniaturized LDV-system based on EC-
level. The following ﬂow characteristics can be obtained as “described in (Wulf et a1., 1999), i.e. velocity time series
and biﬁircation scenarios, autocorrelation function, power spectra, Lyapunov exponents and reconstructed.

attractors.Since LDV-systems are well established in investigations of a lot of diﬁ'erent ground based ﬂow
problems, it is expected that in the future of microgravity- e‘Xperimmts in ﬂuid'dynamics a lot of experiments will as
well require this precision tool. Especially the application on tinsteady phenomena will be of more and more
interest. The wide spread application of this technique is, beside its high precision and non-invasion based on the
possibility to run the system fully automatically, the very easy adjustment compared to other measurement methods
and the reliable operation in different environments. This is especially useful in a space laboratory, where
callibrations are difficult during a mission. ' l ' .
CONCLUSIONS '

The thermal convection between spherical shells under a simulated. a central force ﬁeld with and without
rotation under microgravity conditions will be investigated, in addition to terrestn'al experiments and numerical
simulations.

To achieve the objectives of chapter 3, different diagnostic tools will be needed. The laboratory hardWare of
the GBOFLOW experiment built for earth-bound testing and optimization will prove if the proposed optical
methods can work on spherical geometries, especially in the environment of the ESL experiment container. Apart
form the scientiﬁc results, the experience with the laboratory hardware will help to construct a universal spherical
gap in the Fluid Science Laboratory, which could proﬁt of all the different optical methods supplied by the Optical
Diagnostics Module. In addition, a miniatm'ized LDV-system would give more insight into the dynamies of time
dependant ﬂows. Together with the global Optical visualization methods, the LDV technique could help to answer
some of the open questions of transition phenomena of thermal convection in rotating spherical gaps.
