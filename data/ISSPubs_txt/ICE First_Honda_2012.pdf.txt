How microgravitational space environments affect aging is not well understood. We observed that, in
Caenorhabditis elegans, spaceﬂight suppressed the formation of transgenically expressed polyglutamine
aggregates, which normally accumulate with increasing age. Moreover, the inactivation of each of seven

ifespan and aging rate in metazoans are inﬂuenced by environmental factors, including temperaturel,
oxygenz, pheromone3, and food intake“. Accordingly, perturbation of sensory perception or signaling of
mechanical, chemical, or osmotic stimuli changes the lifespan of Caenorhabditis elegans5. Microgravity has
been shown to induce several physiological or pathological changes including disturbance of the sense of equi—
librium and loss of muscle and bone mass, mainly from the observations in spaceﬂight? However, how micro—
gravity affects organismal aging and lifespan has not been well understood. This issue is not only intriguing from a
basic scientific perspective but also important from a space medical aspect, because the duration of space missions
will be increasing such as those for human exploration of other planets or colonization of the moon. To obtain
some basic insights into aging in space, we examined an aging marker in space—ﬂown C. elegans and explored the
involvement of the genes whose expression was changed during spaceﬂight, in the control of lifespan.
Results
During the International C. elegans Experiment First (ICE 1st) project7, we investigated the effect of spaceﬂight on
the formation of aggregates of a 35-glutamine repeat (Q35) in C. elegans transgenically expressing the (CAG)35-
yellow ﬂuorescent protein (YFP) gene in muscle, which normally increases with advancing age8 (Fig. 1). Q35
aggregate formation expressed as the number of aggregates per worm was found to be lower in worms ﬂown in
space from the L1 larva stage and L4/young adult stage than in matched ground control worms (Fig. 2A, B). This
difference may be because of the possible changes in growth rate induced by spaceﬂight. However, growth of
worms has been reported to be unaffected by spaceﬂight”. Moreover, the number of aggregates per body length
was lower in space-ﬂown worms than in ground control worms (Fig. 2D, E). This indicated that the spaceﬂight-
induced suppression of Q35 aggregates was not ascribed to the spaceﬂight-induced changes in growth rate.
Numbers of Q35 aggregates per total YFP ﬂuorescence intensity in each worm, an indicator of Q35 expression,
was also lowered by spaceﬂight (Fig. 2F, G). This showed that the spaceﬂight-induced suppression of Q35

stimuli including microgravity, sensory perception, neuronal and endocrine signaling, and motorneuron—muscle signaling work through changes
in these gene activities. These changes, some of which activate DAF—16 and/ or SKN—l transcription factors, induce “longevity—promoting”
processes including dietary—restriction signaling, stabilization of protein structure or dauer—related efficient life maintenance during harsh
