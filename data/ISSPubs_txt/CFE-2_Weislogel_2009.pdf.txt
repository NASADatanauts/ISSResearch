NASA is considering a second series of handheld test vessels to further study important
characteristics of low-g capillary ﬂows aboard the International Space Station (188). These
Capillary Flow Experiments (CFE-Z) consists of eleven (< 1.5kg) test vessels designed to
probe certain capillary phenomena of fundamental and applied importance such as: critical
wetting in discontinuous structures and surfaces, capillary ﬂows in complex containers, and
passive gas-liquid phase separations. Highly quantitative Video images from the simply-
performed experiments are expected to provide immediate conﬁrmation of, and guidance
for, current analytical and numerical design tools for the development of advanced ﬂuid
systems aboard spacecraft. Four of the eleven vessels proposed require simple, quick and
low cost adaptations to existing ﬂight hardware. The remaining units require new builds. All
of the experiments contain small volumes of zero hazard ﬂuids, require no electrical
interface, minimal crew training, and may be conducted in the open at any location aboard
theISS.
I. Introduction
Capillary ﬂows and phenomena are critical to myriad ﬂuids management systems in low-gravity environments:
fuels/cryogen storage systems, thermal control systems (e.g., vapor/liquid separation), life support systems
(e.g., water recycling), and materials processing in the liquid state. In fact, NASA’S near term exploration missions
plan larger liquid propellant masses than have ever ﬂown on interplanetary missions. Under microgravity
conditions, capillary forces can be exploited to control ﬂuid orientation so that such large mission-critical systems
perform predictably. The second Capillary Flow Experiment (CFE-Z) presented here is a simple ﬁandamental
scientiﬁc study that can yield quantitative results from safe, low-cost, short time-tO-ﬂight, handheld ﬂuids
experiments. The experiments aim to provide results of interest and value to the capillary ﬂow engineering
community that cannot be readily achieved in ground-based tests. Speciﬁc applications of the results center on
particular ﬂuids challenges concerning propellant tanks and water processing for life support.

"2","II. Review of the CFE-l experiments

The simplicity of the original CFE vessels led to a high success rate when conducted on 188. A preliminary
review of CFE aboard 188 citing background literature may be found in several conference papers cited herein with
several journal articles expected shortly. In short, the experiments greatly exceeded their original expectations in
part made possible by many Opportunities for 0nb0ard Operations, the rare joy of 1irnitedtria1 and error on orbit, and
the generosity of the crew to conduct ‘science of Opportunity’ during their personal free time (approximately 50% 0f
CFE was conducted in this mode). In the end, and over a 3 year period aboard ISS (Incrernents 9—15, 8/2004-
12/2007), 19 CFE Operations were performed requiring z 57 hours of crew time by 7 astronauts (15 hours was
originally planned). Approximately 40 hours of Video data were collected representing over 690 data points. The
studies focused on important fundamental and applied issues such as the establishment of a database for the contact
line boundary conditicnl, drop irnpacts, adhesion, and satellite ejection; 3-D wicking rates and the dynamical
boundary condition formulation; passive phase separations (bubbly ﬂows); critica1 geometric wetting conditions
including an asymmetric bulk shift wetting condition: statics, dynarnics, hysteresis, benchmarks; and an idea p001
and criterion (tools) for passive ﬂuid control. For a comprehensive report on CFE-l refer to Ref. 2. The motivations
to conduct further experiments for CFE-2 are in part summarized below in turn.

111. Introduction to the CFE-2 experiments

In general, for CFE-type experiments the experiment dimensions are chosen as large as possible to remain
characteristic with those of existing spacecraft systems. This is accomplished in part for the practitioner who
connects 10w-g experimental veriﬁcation of such phenomena with increased conﬁdence and technology readiness
level. For experiment performance reasons, the experiment dimensions are limited by a combination of experiment
rnass, volume, ﬂuid volume (limited by safety), and crew handling constraints. The larger the interface, the more
applicable the results to realistic 10w-g systems; the longer the interface relaxation times are, the stronger the need
for long duration microgravity conditions. Perhaps more importantly, the larger the system, the less the impact of
surface imperfections which can dominate related ‘rnicrcﬂuidic’ terrestrial experiments. Microscale versions of the
proposed experiments are possible and pursued (as are drop tower test versions). Unfortunately, such complex
geometries are often difﬁcult if not impossible to fabricate at rnicrcscales with present techniques without sacriﬁcing
key geometric requirements such as sharp interior corners, 3-D verses 2-D structure, low surface roughness-tc-
container length ratios, and clear optical access of interface proﬁles. Additionally, buoyancy induced convection
prevents the study Of many passive purely capillary phase separations on Earth.

A. The Vane Gap (VG) experiments (Re-ﬂight: 2 units VGl, VG2)

The Vane Gap (VG) experiment seeks to identify a fundamental wetting condition akin to the critical corner
wetting condition analyzed by Concus and Finn3, but for interior corners formed by walls that possess a gap at the
Virtual axis of intersection of the two ‘wa11s’. Such a ‘wa11—vane gap’ is common in spacecraft systems, but should
not be cavalierly treated as an ideal corner. The original CFE tests were highly successful to uncover the complex
interaction of geometry, contact angle, asymmetry, and gap wetting; both static and dynamics. The most detailed
review of the work to date is contained in Chen et al.4 The re-ﬂight VG experiments aim to determine critica1
wetting conditions for perforated sheets for perfectly wetting ﬂuids. Such constructs are used in tankage systems
(e.g. Skinner et a1.5 and papers by Jaek1e6'9) and serve as models for screens and perforated sheets, plates, or vanes,
etc. The impact of such ‘pcrcus substrates’ is expected to be signiﬁcant; with immediate implications to the design
of passive geometries to manage highly wetting fuels, cryogens, thermal ﬂuids, and contaminated aqueous solutions
(i.e. urine processors).

The vane gap critica1 wetting phenomena has been computed numerically using Surface Evolver4’10 for solid
surfaces, but is greatly challenged by the presence of essentially 3-D porous wa11s due to a spectra of length scales.
The cases proposed for investigation require both numerical ‘experiments’, theory development, and validation by
space experiment which will serve as a guide to further applications. A ground-based protocol is anticipated that can
be used as a tool to efﬁciently compute complex, rnu1ti-sca1e capillary phenomena. The experiment focuses on the
establishment of equilibrium, which requires ample 10w-g time as well as small amplitude perturbations to assure
10ca1 stability. The experiment is ideally suited for hand Operation by a crewmember and builds on the heritage of
similar experiments ﬂown on the Space Shuttlell’u, Russian Mir Space Station“, and International Space Station13 .
Simple modiﬁcations to the existing CFE-VG units require the replacement of the existing CFE-VG vanes with
newly designed and fabricated ones.

The primary objective of the VG units is to determine equilibrium interface conﬁgurations and critical wetting
conditions for interfaces between interior corners separated by a gap. Perfectly wetting ﬂuids will be tested using

"3","perforated plates as vanes. Two perforation—types Will be employed to test two edge conditions. A second objective
is to determine critical wetting transients in such cases While a third is to validate numerical predictions and
establish a solution protocol for the disparate length scale discontinuous, or nearly discontinuous, wetting
phenomena.

In a strict sense, the critical corner wetting condition3 is radically altered for interior corners that do not actually
contact; such as in the gap formed by a vane and tank wall of a large propellant storage tank (a commonality in
practice), or the near intersection of vanes in a tank With complex vane network. The VG experiments Will test a
speciﬁc selection of vane-Wall types. Vane gap and vane-Wall angle Will be varied by repeatedly sweeping about
both sub- and super-critical wetting regimes as well as the wetting hysteresis map. The container consists of an
elliptic cylindrical test vessel With an axial vane that can be pivoted changing both the angle of the vane and wall
and the size of the vane-Wall gap as depicted in Fig. 1. Two perforated vanes are employed With varying open areas.
Each vane employs one smooth and one serrated edge so that two gap—types can be tested for each container. A
schematic of this approach is also provided in Fig. 1.

After injecting the prescribed amount of ﬂuid the crewmember rotates the vane at set intervals allowing
signiﬁcant time (up to 15min) for the ﬂuid to equilibrate between each interval. Static interface shapes recorded by
high resolution Video Will be compared quantitatively With numerically computed shapes. At a critical vane angle
the ﬂuid Will spontaneously wet along the vane edge at Which point the vane angle Wi11be measured for comparison
to theory. The dynamics of the process is predicted to obey a power law depending in a complex manner on the
geometry. The pinning edges provided by the perforations contribute to an altered effective (in this case, nonzero)
contact ang1e14'16. The serrated vane edge contributes to an altered effective (in this case, larger) vane gap distance.

B. The Interior Corner Flow (ICF) experiments (re-ﬂight units ICFl and 2; new units ICF3 through ICF9)

The Interior Corner Flow (ICF) experiment seeks to at least determine: (1) the rates of 3-D imbibition of wetting
ﬂuids in containers of systematically increasing complexity, (2) the dependence of model dynamical boundary
conditions as a function of geometry, and (3) the performance of such devices as passive phase separators (i.e.
converting bubbly ﬂows to separated continuous gas and liquid inventories). On a local level, the initial wetting
rates of such ﬂows are fast and can be studied using drop towers. However, a slow migration (‘secondary
imbibition’) of ﬂuid across the chamber driven by the combined effects of capillary forces and global changes in
container dimensions at present can only be thoroughly and convincingly studied in the long duration low-g
environment of the 188.

The test cells employ characteristic dimensions of current spacecraft equipment—approximately two orders of
magnitude larger than similar systems on Earth. This choice signiﬁcantly alters the time scales of the ﬂow and
dramatically increases (104-fold) the volume of ﬂuid involved as well as the effective accuracy of the test cell
geometry. The experiments are designed to benchmark the analytical techniques developed to predict such ﬂows.
The benchmarked theory can then be used to design and analyze capillary devices for positioning liquids passively
in containers in low-g environments by careful control over container geometry. The devices are used to perform

"4","passive phase separation operations as in the case of tapered screen galleries for bubble-free collection and
positioning of fuels for satellites, an important and outstanding problem for propellant, coolant, or water
management aboard spacecraft”. The ICFl and ICF2 units are originally from the CFE—l project and Will be re-
ﬂown With increases in ﬂuid Viscosity and ﬂuid volume. The seven new ICF units test additional geometry—types
relevant to tankage, multiphase thermal control, and life support applications.

The obj ectives of the ICF tests include the experimental determination of secondary imbibition rates in complex
containers due to spontaneous large length scale capillary ﬂows along interior corners in weakly 3-dimensional
containers. Additional objectives include the identiﬁcation of the correct dynamical boundary conditions for such
ﬂows as well as the quantiﬁcation of passive phase separation characteristics of certain capillary driven multiphase—
ﬂows along interior corners. The experimental results Will be used to verify or further guide current theoretical
predictions. They Will also provide benchmarks for numerical methods.

The ‘taper’ (or porosity gradient) of these containers provides particular design advantages in preferentially
locating the liquid Where desirable. The most current review of the present work may be found in Weislogel et al.18
With a more complete article expected shortly. The equations governing the process are known and have been in part
veriﬁed by the original CFE ICF experiments along With complimentary drop tower tests. However, those
experiments identify families of geometries that behave differently depending on the nature of the 3-D container
geometry. The re—ﬂight vessels ICFl and ICF2 investigate parabolically and linearly tapered sections, see Fig. 2.
The seven new ICF vessels proposed represent neW geometry types that could easily ﬁnd application in spacecraft
ﬂuids system design and provide a means for further and highly quantitative investigation and model veriﬁcation.
These are represented schematically in Fig. 3. Long—duration low—g experimental results Will guide the analysis by
providing the necessary boundary condition(s) as a function of container cross section, ﬁll fraction, and bubble
separation limits: bubble size, density, and distribution.

Full 3-D Wicking in capillary structures can be studied at macro—scales in long duration low-g environments
using such ICF vessels. Such ﬂows are critical to understanding not just ﬂows aboard spacecraft, but also similar
ﬂows in certain terrestrial systems. The ﬂows incorporate 3-D capillary driven corner ﬂow networks consisting of a
small matrix of interconnected pores. The CFE-2 ICFS and ICF8 experiments are performed in a similar manner as
other ICF experiments only the container is partitioned adding signiﬁcantly to both the complication and value of
the ﬂow, see Fig. 3. The ﬂows Will serve as a benchmark for pore level imbibition in porous media. Liquid bearing
containers can easily be interconnected by capillary structures. Such structures form the building blocks of ‘porous
media”, but can also be exploited to a high degree in spacecraft fuels management systems. Time dependent ﬂows as
functions of unit cell dimensions and geometry, unit cell interconnectivity, overall structure dimensions, and taper
Will be studied. The passive phase separation characteristics of such constructs Will also be investigated.

IV. Science Requirements
Because the impact of geometry on such ﬂow phenomena is the research objective, it is possible to provide the
science requirements by simply specifying the design geometry of the various containers. Such speciﬁcations along
With ﬂuid properties, ﬂuid volumes, and approximate bubble generation and separation details are listed below. The
speciﬁcations are selected using current analytic tools (in part to be veriﬁed by the experiments themselves) in such
a manner that each experiment requires approximately the same time (~10min) simplifying crew procedures and
training, While increasing ﬂexibility in experiment order, priority, performance opportunities, and in-ﬂight
scheduling. Note that all experiments employ perfectly wetting silicone oils (contact angle 0°).

high as 50%. High speed Video images are provided in Fig. 4 during bubble formation and shortly following, where

V. Experimental Test Plan

The general set-up, camera alignment, focus, lighting, ﬂuid ﬁll, expected ﬂuid response times, and experiment
Operation times are designed to be similar for each ICF container to standardize the routine for performing CFE-2 0n
orbit. The most critical experimental steps are listed here in order for CFE-2’s VG and ICF test vessels.

TWO VG units are needed for the experiment to identify the impact of vane geometry and vane porosity 0n the
critical wetting phenomena. The two units are in every way identical except for the perforated vane type, CFE-VGl
36.5% Open, CFE-VG2 16.2% open. The original CFE-l VG vessels can be refurbished for this purpose. The newly
constructed vanes must have two ‘edges’ as shown in Fig. l. The general experiment procedures for both vessels are
identical and include:

1. A prescribed amount of liquid is dispensed from a reservoir into the elliptic eross-sectioned cylindrical

container in the lOW-g environment.

2. The vane is then indexed Clockwise through one complete revolution (360°) in approximately 32 prescribed
degree increments. The response of the ﬂuid interface is recorded by Video.

3. At each increment of vane rotation, time (approximately 30s) is allowed for the interface to establish
equilibrium. Small perturbations (by hand, i.e. ﬁnger taps) t0 the container may be employed to assure local
equilibrium is established. At or near critical vane angles signiﬁcant time (~l5min) is allotted for the
reorientation and full stabilization.

4. The vane rotation procedure is then reversed (counter Clockwise) With identical increments and perturbations
for the equilibrium surfaces.

5. The Clockwise/eounter Clockwise rotation may be repeated indeﬁnitely—three times is desired. (The
perforations are speciﬁed large enough that liquid remaining in the perforations after each critical wetting
event may be dislodged by crew perturbations.)

The 9 CFE-2 ICF units are:

l. ICFl (re-ﬂight, equilateral triangular section, parabolic taper)

2. ICF2 (re-ﬂight, rectangular section, linear taper)

3. ICF3 (new, stepped snow cone taper, large angle 90°)

4. ICF4 (new, stepped snow cone taper, small angle 50°)

5. ICF5 (new, square graded porosity container, l-t0-4-paek)

6. ICF6 (new, square section, linearly tapered vane)

7. ICF7 (new, Circular cylindrical section, linearly tapered vane)

8. ICF8 (new, aXially partitioned snow cone, 50° vertex angle)

9. ICF9 (new, full parabolic tapered equilateral triangle)

Once the required test vessel, Video camera, and lighting conditions are established, the test sequences for the ICF
containers are similar and follow a general procedure: The test vessel Chambers are preﬁlled With a prescribed
volume of ﬂuid to reduce over-pressurization during liquid volume adjustments between experiments.

1. The ﬂuid is positioned at the base of the container by valve-piston reservoir operations or ereW-indueed

centrifugal accelerations. This and the processes to follow are captured on Video.

2. After the initial imbibition is complete (ﬂuid shifts to ‘top’ of container and equilibrates), the test is repeated
twice either by repeating the valve-piston operation or centrifugal method.

"9","3. The apparatus should then be used to repeat the tests performed in (2), but allowing for a by-pass tube
connecting the base of the tapered container with the top of the container. The tests conducted with such a by-
pass line Open simulate certain applications in microgravity ﬂuids management systems and provide a unique
comparison Opportunity for the theory as ﬂuid imbibes within the container as well as is drawn in parallel
through the bypass line.

4. The experiments in (2) and (3) above are then repeated following the generation of a variety of bubbles in the
liquid. For ICFl and 2, with the prescribed amount of ﬂuid in the test chamber, bubbles can be generated in the
Chamber by ‘shaking’ the container. The container should be replaced for Video photography, and the passive
imbibition, phase separation and coalescence phenomena recorded. Such tests should be repeated up to 3 times
with several tests performed for a variety of bubble sizes, densities, and distributions. For ICF3 through ICF9,
a bubble generation scheme is employed to more effectively generate bubble distributions with bubble sizes
typically 1.5mm to 2mm diameter and larger, but 0.5mm and lower diameters are of interest too. Liquid
fracti0n0% and 50% are desired (see Fig. 4).

Digitized Video images will be compared to theoretical and numerical predictions. ICFl and ICF2 are expected to
be refurbished for re-ﬂight to satisfy these requirements with the added capability to more signiﬁcantly vary the
ﬂuid volume in ICFl and to possibly add a foaming surfactant t0 ICF2. As mentioned, ICF3 through ICF9 require
similar, but new hardware.

VI. Status and Flight Prospects

ICFl and ICF2 have started the refurbishment process. All test procedures and analyses have been updated to
support the reﬂight. New Pistons and Drivers have been fabricated and are in house. VGl and VG2 perforated vanes
have been designed and are currently being fabricated. New Pistons and Drivers have also been fabricated for the
vessels and are in house. Updates to the test procedures and analyses will commence shortly. ICF3 and ICF4 vessels
have been designed and are currently being fabricated. The bubble generation method common to ICF3 through
ICF9 has been tested and shown to successfully generate a uniform bubbly mix with acceptable bubble size
distribution. Final design is pending successful testing of a new seal design expected to occur in J anuary 2009. Upon
successful testing, a fabrication order will be released to fabricate all Of the bubble generation components. The
vessel design for ICF6 and ICF7 is ready for review prior to releasing a fabrication order. The ICF9 vessel design is
nearing completion and will likely be part Of the same fabrication order. ICFS and ICF8 vessel design is still in the
concept stage with preliminary drawings and models following the requirements development.

CFE-2 is targeting two ﬂights with siX vessels on the ﬁrst ﬂight and the remainder 0n the second. ICFl, ICF2,
VGl, VG2, ICF3 and ICF4 will ﬂy on either ULF3 (STS-128) on Aug 6, 2009 or 19A (STS—129) on Nov 12, 2009.
Hardware turnover has not been negotiated yet, but is expected to be L-30 days as these vessels are currently
launching in the Shuttle Inid-deek. The remainder of test cells ICFS through ICF9 will ﬂy on ULF4 (STS—131) on
Feb 11, 2010. Hardware turnover is expected to be sometime in September 2009 as these vessels will be loaded in
an MPLM. CFE-2 successfully completed its Requirements Deﬁnition Review (RDR) in June 2008 and is currently
targeting J anuary 29, 2009 for the Critical Design Review (CDR).
