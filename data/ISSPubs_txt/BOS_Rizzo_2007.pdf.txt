4 Conclusions
Over the past 15 years space medicine has become increasingly '
concerned with the effects of spaceﬂight 0n hematological
processes; astronauts have consistently returned from space-
ﬂight with a decreased red blood cell mass (RBCM) ”space- :
ﬂight anemia” and plasma volume (PV). Although PV is known
to be labile, current theories for the control of erythropoiesis
cannot account for a decrease in RBCM 0f 10% in <10 days.
Our data conﬁrm these observations and point out: a decrease 3'
of antioxidant defenses in RBC; a modiﬁcation of cell mem-
brane composition. These might be the consequences of
increased cell aging due to exposure during ﬂight to increased .
oxidative stress. We need more data to conﬁrm this hypothesis
