ABSTRACT
Keywords: Space, Earth Observation, Remote Sensing, lntemational Space Station, NASA
This paper addresses the question of what contributions the lntemational Space Station (lSS) can make as a sensor
based remote sensing platform. There is precedent for the use of manned platforms in Low Earth Orbit (LEO).
Skylab had the Earth Resources Experiment Package (EREP). In the Shuttle —Mir program, the Piroda module was
dedicated to Earth sensing. One experiment in the Piroda, the Multispectral Stereo Scanner (MOMS-ZPP) was used
for quantifying the advantages of performing remote sensing on the lSS. The Space Shuttle program also made
signiﬁcant contributions to Earth observations. Sixteen missions carried electronic experiment packages for Earth
observations and crew on almost every mission performed earth observations using cameras.
Experiments planned for the 188 can also tell us much about the potential the 188 has as a remote sensing platform
- by examining their design and objectives. In March of 2009 an experiment called Agricultural Camera (AgCam)
was delivered to the 185 for installation in the window of the Laboratory module. In fall of 2009 two more remote
sensing experiments will arrive on the ISS - the Hyperspectral lmager for the Coastal Ocean (HlCO) and the Remote
Atmospheric and lonospheric Detection System (RAIDS). These instruments will be combined on one experiment
package, HlCO- RAlDS experiment package (HREP), and will be placed outside the 158, on an external platform.
1. INTRODUCTION

International Space Station ([85) construction began in 1998. It is now about 80% complete, and the resources to
support remote sensing operations are now onboard. I SS and Space Shuttle resources have been dominated by the
construction of the 188. As a result the option to use a manned spacecraft in Low Earth Orbit (LEO) has not been
available to the remote sensing community. Consequently, it is clear how effective 188 can be as a remote sensing
platform. Now that the option is available it is time to address the question. This can be accomplished by examining
parallels such as the Skylab Earth Resources Experiment Package (EREP), Space Shuttle Earth observation
missions, and the Shuttle-Mir Piroda module experiments. Remote sensing experiment packages that are planned for
operation on the 188 can help answer the question through an examination of their sensor design and mission
objectives.

2. SKY LAB
Efforts to perform non-photographic remote sensing on a manned spacecraft began with the Skylab program.
Skylab was placed in low Earth orbit in May 1973. Skylab orbited the Earth at an altitude of 435 km, every 93
minutes, at an inclination of 50 degrees and made 15.4 revolutions every day. Skylab carried the EREP. The
instrument selection and parameters were based on the Landsat successes. The EREP consisted of a Multispectral
Photographic Camera System Earth Terrain Camera, an Infrared Spectrometer, a Multispectral Scanner, an L-Band
Radiometer, and a 3-sensor facility (Microwave Radiometer/Scatterometer and Altimeter). Descriptions of the
EREP sensors are listed in Appendix A and their coverage is illustrated in Figure l. EREP sensors provided Earth
images in the visible, IR and microwave spectral regions'.

resolution camera systems, narrow frequency bandwidth scanner systems, and the use of active and passive
microwave systems were demonstrated'. The EREP experiment also resulted in over 400,000 photographs, and
miles of magnetic tape which contained data for Earth science applications. Post ﬂight analysis of sensor
performance showed the sensors performed as expected and post processing data was highly accurate. For example
an assessment of the L-Band Radiometer 8194 antenna pattern and pointing accuracy showed that the predicted and
observed signals were within a few percent of predicted values'.

3. SPACE SHUTTLE
On April 12, 1981 the ﬁrst Space Shuttle was launched. STS-l was a manned test ﬂight and had no payload. The
Space Shuttle ﬂew in a nearly circular orbit at an altitude of 298 km, orbited the Earth every 90.35 minutes made
15.9 orbits around the Earth each day. On November 12, 1981, STS-2. the ﬁrst shuttle mission to carry a payload,
was launched. In its payload bay it carried the Office of Space and Terrestrial Applications Pallet (OSTA-l) which
consisted of the Measurement of Air Pollution from Satellite (MAPS) experiment, the Shuttle Multispectral Infrared
Radiometer (SMIRR) experiment, the Shuttle Imaging Radar (SlR-A) experiment, the Features Identiﬁcation and
Location Experiment (FILE) and the Ocean Color Experiment (OCE)3. The OSTA ﬂew three more times. A total of
sixteen shuttle missions carried remote sensing Earth observation payloads and performed observations from the
Space Shuttle. Appendix B lists the major Earth observation remote sensing payloads ﬂown on the Space Shuttle but
does not include the deployment of satellites for earth observation, communication or astronomical observations.
The Space Shuttle was frequently utilized as an Earth observation platform and made signiﬁcant contributions to the
ﬁelds that rely on Earth observations‘. The last Earth observation mission, STS-99, ﬂew in February of 2000. This
mission was dubbed The Shuttle Radar Topography Mission (SRTM). It ﬂew at an altitude of 233 km and an
inclination of 57 degrees“. The SRTM used radar interferometry. Two radar images were taken in a single pass from
antennae at slightly different locations to obtain elevation infomation. One radar antennae was in the shuttle's
payload bay and the other was at the end of a 60-meter (200-foot) boom. The result was a single 3-D images. These
images generated a high-resolution digital topographic map of most of the Earth“. The SRTM data is available to
the public at http://edc.usgs.gov/Qroducts/sate1lite.
4. SHUTTLE - MIR PROGRAM
The core module of the Soviet Union’s Mir Space Station was launched on February, 20, 19867. Mir orbited the
Earth at an altitude of 380 km, every 89.89 minutes at an inclination of 5 1 .6 degrees and made 16.33 revolutions per
days. The former Soviet Union planned to add a remote sensing module to perform combined civilian and military

was put in storageg.
In 1993 NASA agreed to provide funds to complete the Piroda module in exchange for an allocation of
approximately 700 kg of US experiments. Piroda docked with Mir in April 1996 and was the last module to be
added. The scientiﬁc instruments on Piroda are described in Appendix C. These instruments supported studies on
, the atmosphere and ocean, land characteristics, optical characteristics of the atmosphere, sea surface roughness,
concentrations of trace gases in the atmosphere, and compared radiation and reﬂection characteristics of the sea
surface in the microwave range"").
4.1 Modular Optoelectronic Multispectral Stereo Scanner, MOMS—ZP
Experiments originally planned by the German lnterkosmos program for launch aboard satellites were remanifested
on Piroda. The German Modular Optoelectronic Multispectral Stereo Scanner, MOMS-ZP, a 4- channel .
multispectral scanner, was part of that German contribution. MOMS-ZP, the ﬁrst instrument ﬂown in space using
the push broom scan principle, combined high resolution panchromatic images with multispectral images (three
cameras for three fold along track stereoscopic imaging and two cameras for multispectral imaging in four spectral
bands)”. See Table 1 for instrument descriptions.

In 2002, when it became known that there were no Remote Sensing experiments planned for the ISS, concerned
researchers from the United States, Israel, and Germany performed a study assessing the potential of the ISS as a
remote sensing platform. Data from MOMS-ZP and the free-ﬂying Landsat Thematic Mapper (TM) system were
compared. The Landsat TM channels used are described in Table l alongside the corresponding MOMS—ZP
instruments descriptions”. They have comparable imaging systems but MOMS-ZP was at an altitude of 380-405 km
and Landsat TM was at an altitude of 705 km. The four channels of the MOMS-ZP were very similar to ﬁrst four
bands of the Landsat TM, except that the MOMS-ZP channels had 35-60nm wide wavelength intervals while the
Landsat TM had 60-140 nm wide wavelength intervals. The altitude of Mir, 380 to 405 km, resulted in a much
smaller ground resolution cell (GRC). The GRC is a product of the Instantaneous Field of View (IFOV) of the
instrument and the altitude:
GRC = IFOV x Altitude (1)
MOMS-ZP bands 1-4 have GRCs between 15.9 and 18 m vs. GRCs for Landsat between 28.5 to 30 m. The
comparison was made using images from a study area with distinct features, taken under similar conditions and
processed in a similar manner. For the purpose of quantitative comparison unsupervised classiﬁcations were also
performed. MOMS-ZP images exhibited more and sharper structural features. _

"4","' It was concluded that a multispectral imaging system on the [88 would provide improved spatial resolution over that
obtained by the same instrument in a higher orbit. Also, having the sensor closer to the target would allow for more
energy to arrive at the sensor.

E = 1/ (Distance to Sensor) 2 (2) -
This would require less compromise between spatial and spectral resolution since energy reﬂected from surfaces is
limited and this energy decreases with the inverse square of the distance to the sensor. They also went on to say that
imaging from external sites using oblique angles would support atmospheric studiesl '.
I 5. INTERNATIONAL SPACE STATION (188)
188 is in nearly circular orbit at an altitude of 400 km, has an inclination of 5 l .6 degrees, orbits the Earth every 93
minutes, makes 16 orbits around the Earth each day with repeat coverage every three days”.
The ﬁrst three crewmembers arrived on the lSS in November 2000. They had with them the Crew Earth
Observations (CEO) experiment. The CEO is a suite of cameras, lenses and targets for Earth observations”. In
February of 2001 , during the ﬁrst 188 increment, EarthKAM arrived. EarthKAM is an educational project designed
to provide digital images for study in the classroom”. The CEO experiment and EarthKAM have been in operation
for the last 8 years. From March 2007 to March 2009 the crew collaborated with scientists to observe and explore
the Earth’s Polar Regions. This eﬁ‘ort was named Crew Earth Observation lntemational Polar Year (CEO-[PY)'5.
CEO and CEO IPY images have (depending on the camera lens and look angle) pixel sizes between 30 m and 60
m”. The CEO experiment images complement images taken by orbiting satellites. In a comparison of Landsat,
SPOT, and 188 data used for estimates of landscape parameters of Paciﬁc Ocean atolls the worst discrepancy was
less than 7%”. These efforts successfully capture scenes of interest to scientists and students. -
The 188 now has six crew members (providing more crew time) and is nearly complete. There are external attach
sites available for use as remote sensing platforms. lntemally, the Window Observation Research Facility (WORF)
will provide a platform for Earth observations. The WORF is a stable and reconﬁgurable platform over the Lab
module window for multiple remote sensing imagers. One of the ﬁrst remote sensing instruments to use the WORF
as a platform is the Agricultural Camera (A gCam) '8.
SJ Agricultural Camera (AGCAM)
The AgCam arrived on the [SS in March 2009 and is currently installed in the WORF, but is not yet operational.
AgCam consists of a single 300 mm lens and optical beam splitter for two digital line-scan cameras, each with its
own ﬁlter, red (630 -690 nm) and near infrared (780 -890 nm). The sensor will be able to point up to 30 degrees off
nadir, and provide images with a resolution of 15 to 20 m. Data delivery to the customer will take 1-2 days. AgCam
is a multi spectral sensor and will take images in the red visible (VIS) and near infrared bands (NlR) for derivation
of the normalized digital vegetation index (NDVl) '8. The Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) uses the
difference in the reﬂection of visible and near-infrared light by vegetation. Healthy vegetation absorbs visible light
and reﬂects near-infrared light. Unhealthy vegetation reﬂects visible light and less near-infrared light. This
infomiation is used to characterize plant life on Earth”.

Landsat and the ASTER (Advanced Spacebome Thermal Emission and Reﬂection Radiometer) instrument on the
Terra spacecraft are often used in applications related to agricultural production but temporal resolution is, at best,
every 8 days and cloud interference can delay acquisition of data when it is most needed. On the 188 it is expected
that there will be more frequent viewing opportunities and the AgCam sensor design will provide images at spatial
resolutions and wavelengths optimized for monitoring crop and range conditions. This data will enable farmers to
use precision agriculture techniques and make more effective use of fertilizer and chemical inputs. Ranchers and
land managers need the data to balance land use and land recovery to avoid ecosystem damage due to overuse”.
5.2 HICO — RAIDS Experiment Package, HREP
Due to arrive on the [SS in fall of 2009 is the HREP. HREP consists of two experiments: HlCO and RAIDS. HlCO
is the Hyperspectral lmager for the Coastal Ocean and RAIDS is the Remote Atmospheric and lonospheric
Detection System""). HlCO will be the ﬁrst spacebome hyperspectral imager optimized for characterization of the
coastal environment”. RAIDS is designed to perform comprehensive studies of the upper atmospherez'. HREP will
be deployed on the Japanese Experiment Module-Exposed Facility on the lntemational Space Station as depicted in

Performance of HlCO has been validated through 15 years of aircraft and shipboard experience with precursor
instruments. lmager performance requirements, atmospheric correction algorithms, and product algorithms have
been validated. Imaging from space provides the coverage of coastal areas and provides global repeat coverage
unavailable from aircraft or ships. The [88 covers 75% of the Earth and repeats every three days with repeated
lighting conditions every three months. A hyperspectral imager on 188 will provide the means to monitor the global
coastal ecosystem. HlCO will be capable of detecting subtle changes in reefs and allow early detection of problems.
It will map reefs to provide near real time analysis of changes and support long term ecological studies”.
5.4 Remote Atmospheric and lonospheric Detection System, RAIDS
RAIDS was designed to investigate the global temperature, the lower thermosphere, and upper mesosphere. It has
three photometers (777.4 nm, 630.0 nm, 765.0 nm), three spectrometers (NIR, MUV, NUV), and two spectrographs
(FUV, EUV), as seen in ﬁgure 6. Observations from RAIDS will be used to develop and test techniques for remote
sensing of the neutral atmosphere and ionosphere on a global scale”. RAIDS has eight instruments that are described
in Table 324.

"9","6. CONCLUSIONS
Researchers comparing MOMS-ZP experiment on MIR Piroda with Landsat TM data concluded that: A
multispectral imaging system on the 158 would provide improved spatial resolution over that obtained by the same
instrument in a higher orbit. Furthermore, moving the sensor closer to the target in a lower orbit than Landsat would
allow for more energy to arrive at the sensor and require less compromise between spatial and spectral resolution.
They also concluded imaging ﬁ'om external sites on the 188 would support atmospheric studies”. The 188 provides
the developers of the AgCam, HICO and RAIDS the platform they need to meet their mission objectives.
Performing Earth observations from a manned spacecraft in Low Earth Orbit has a history that parallels the history
of remote sensing and Earth observation. The work has resulted in numerous contributions to those ﬁelds that rely
on Earth observation data from space. The results of the MOMS-ZP/ Landsat TM study, and the AgCam, HICO and
RAIDS instruments clearly indicate that the 188 makes a desirable remote sensing platform. Now that the [SS is
nearly complete, and the resources are available to support remote sensing the tradition of performing Earth
observations by sensors on manned spacecraft in Low Earth Orbit is ready to resume.

STS-85 Cryogenic Inﬁ'ared Spectrometers and Telescopes for the Atmosphere—Shuttle Pallet

8/7/97 Satellite-Z (CRISTA-SPAS-Z) used 3 telescopes and four spectrometers to measure infrared
radiation emitted by the Earth’s middle atmosphere and were retrieved on same mission. A
Two other instruments mounted on the SPAS also will study the Earth's atmosphere. The
Middle Atmosphere High Resolution Spectrograph Instrument (MAHRSI) will measure
hydroxyl and nitric oxide by sensing UV radiation emitted and scattered by the atmosphere,
while the Surface Effects Sample Monitor (SESAM) is a passive carrier for state—of-the-art
optical surfaces to study the impact of the atomic oxygen and the space environment on
materials and services.
