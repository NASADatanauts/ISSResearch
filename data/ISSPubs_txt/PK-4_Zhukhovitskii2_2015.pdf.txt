I. INTRODUCTION

A low—temperature plasma, which includes dust particles with sizes ranging from 1 to
103 ,um, is usually referred to as the dusty or complex plasma. Since the mobility of electrons
is much greater than that Of ions, particles acquire a signiﬁcant negative electric Charge. This
leads to formation of a strongly coupled plasma [1—9], in which various collective phenomena
at the level of individual particles can be Observed. Complex plasmas are studied in gas
discharges at low pressures, e.g., in the radio frequency (RF) discharges. Under microgravity
conditions, large volumes of 3D complex plasma can be Observed. These conditions are
realized either in parabolic ﬂights [10—14] or onboard the International Space Station (188)
[10, 15—20].

The PK—4 project is intended to be a continuation of successful series of PK—1, PK—Z, PK—
3, and PK—3 Plus experiments onboard the 188. The PK—4 setup was exhaustively tested in
parabolic ﬂights [21—23]. Since the PK—4 experiments are focused on dynamical phenomena
in complex plasmas including formation and propagation of the shock waves and solitons,
investigation of the waves associated with the motion of dust particles is of special interest.
The linear waves with a long wavelength larger than the interpartiele distance and the Debye
length are commonly called the dust acoustic waves (DAW).

From the time that the notion of DAW was ﬁrst introduced by Rae, Shukla, and Yu
[24], DAW became a subject of extensive investigations [25]. Havnes et al. [26] predicted
that if the disturbance generating DAW in a strongly coupled system of the dust particles
moves with a supersonic velocity then the Mach cone emerges. The Mach cone Observations
were used for the determination of dust sound velocity, ﬁrst, in the experiments with a
2D lattice plane [27—33] and then in a 3D strongly coupled system of Charged particles
[11, 12, 14, 19, 20] formed in RF discharge in argon. In Ref. [34], the Mach cone Observation
in a complex plasma of the neon RF discharge was used for the determination of the dust
sound velocity. An interesting feature of the 3D studies was independence of the sound
velocity (within the experimental error) of the system parameters such as the dust particle
radius, argon pressure, and the location in the bulk of a dust Cloud. The latter fact is
most surprising because according to the assessment [35], the particle number density in
the inner and outer regions of the dust Cloud differs almost by an order of magnitude; the
particle Charge also Changes signiﬁcantly along the bulk of the Cloud. In addition, the sound

"
"3","3
velocity was found to be isotropic, i.e., it is independent of the direction of wave propagation
with respect to the direction of the gas discharge electric ﬁeld. In experiments with argon
[11, 12, 14, 19, 20], the measured sound velocity ranged from 2 t0 3 cm/s; the sound velocity
measured in neon proved to be twice as low (about 1 cm/s) [34] but it was still independent
of the particle number density.

In the pioneer work [24], calculation of the dust sound velocity was based on the ﬂuid
approach. This result is valid if the dust component of the complex plasma conforms to the
ideal gas equation of state while the average kinetic energy of particles (particle temperature
T d) is equal to zero. The resulting formula for the sound velocity is similar to that for the ion
acoustic waves [36]. However, the systems of dust particles, for which the sound velocity was
measured are strongly coupled with a typical coupling parameter F : Z 262 / rdT d > 200 [37],
where Z is the dust particle charge in units of the electron charge, 6 is the elementary electric
charge, rd : (3 / 47md)1/ 3 is the Wigner—Seitz radius for the dust particles, ml is the particle
number density, and the Boltzmann constant is set to unity. Note that this estimate is most
likely a low bound for P, which relates to the smallest particles used in experiments and
the lowest estimates for the particle charge; for real systems, F can be orders of magnitude
higher. Note that the dust kinetic temperature determined experimentally is rather high:
according to [38], T d < 0.8 eV; in Ref. [39], the dust temperature was found to be in the
range from 0.1 to 1 eV. Thus, T d/T n N 30, where Tn is the temperature of gas molecules
usually assumed to be equal to room temperature. In spite of this fact, T >> 1.

Khrapak and Thomas [40] showed that for strongly coupled Yukawa systems, the dust
sound propagation is deﬁned by the nonzero compressibility of the particles resulting from
their correlation energy. The term in the expression for the sound velocity corresponding to
the electric ﬁeld perturbation due to charge separation in the sound wave, which was solely
taken into account in the work [24], appeared to be canceled out exactly by the plasma—
related contribution to the isothermal compressibility modulus. However, the results of
this work are not directly applicable to the complex plasmas because the latter is different
from the Yukawa systems [41, 42]. A principal difference comes from the fact that the
complex plasma is an Open system characterized by an intense energy exchange with the
environment; due the production of electrons and ions, their recombination and loss on
chamber walls, and to charging of the dust particles, the charged components of complex
plasma do not form a ﬁxed ensemble. Therefore, equilibrium thermodynamics along with all

"
"4","4
related thermodynamic notions such as, e.g., the entropy, is not applicable for this system.
Another difference lies in the presence of an external electric ﬁeld typical for both the ac
and dC discharges. This ﬁeld is responsible for the emergence of ion drag force, which along
with the electric ﬁeld deﬁnes the dynamics of dust particles [35]. It is also important that
the particle Charge is not ﬁxed but is a function of the local number densities of electrons,
ions, and particles, whose variation may reach an order of magnitude. Note that the particle
Charge variation was not allowed for in [24] and [40]. Nevertheless, the real complex plasma
can be locally treated as a system of strongly correlated particles on a uniform Charge
background formed by the electrons and ions, i.e., as the one—Component plasma. This
determines a principal similarity between the complex plasma and the strongly coupled
Yukawa system.

The Objective of this work is to develop a theory of DAW propagation in a real system
(the dust Cloud in a low—pressure discharge). Our approach is based on the model of scalable
complex plasma [35]. According to this model, the dust Cloud can be stable if the electric
force from an external electric ﬁeld is balanced by the force due to collisions with the
ions drifting in this electric ﬁeld (ion drag force). The key assumption of the model is
overlapping of the Coulomb potentials of neighboring particles, due to which the cross section
of ion scattering on the particles is a function of the particle number density. This made it
possible to relate the number density of electrons, ions, and particles, and the particle Charge
in such a way that each parameter deﬁnes uniquely the others. The “dust invariant” was
Obtained that is nearly constant for the dust Clouds Observed in different experiments. As a
consequence, a reasonable estimation for the stationary particle number density, which was
shown to be independent of the number of injected particles, was Obtained. The resulting
ionization equation of state (IEOS) was written in two dimensionless variables, i.e., the dust
Cloud was treated as a scalable twe—parameter system. This IEOS allows one to calculate
the compressibility of a dust Cloud.

The propagation of DAW is investigated using the ﬂuid approach. Note that the Navier—
Stokes equation can be applied for the collective motion of dust particles even at the length
scales commensurable with several interpartiele distances [37, 43, 44]. The same approach
was used for the strongly coupled Yukawa systems in [40]. In the ﬂuid dynamics equations,
we take into account the electric force and the ion drag. Linearization Of these equation
shows that the balance of forces in an unperturbed medium leads to full compensation of

"
"5","5
the contribution from the electric ﬁeld perturbation. Thus, the sound velocity is solely
deﬁned by the dust compressibility. Here, the situation is similar to that for the strongly
coupled Yukawa systems [40]. In addition, we allow for the interaction between the particles
and the neutrals (neutral drag), which makes it possible to calculate the damping rate of
DAW.

The resulting formula for the dust sound looks quite different from that Of Ref. [24]
(and also, from [40]). In accordance with IEOS, an increase of the particle number density
entails a decrease in the particle Charge. Consequently, the dust compressibility and the
sound velocity prove to be almost constant everywhere in the bulk of dust Cloud, in spite
of a considerable variation of the complex plasma parameters. The sound velocity proves to
depend weakly 0n the dust particle radius and gas pressure. For the experiments with argon,
it is in a reasonable agreement with the experimental data, in contrast to the calculation
using the formula Obtained in [24]. Developed theory makes it possible to perform prognostic
estimations for conditions typical for the PK—4 experiments.

The paper is organized as follows. In Sec. II, we formulate the governing equations for
scalable complex plasma. In Sec. III, we represent IEOS for the stationary dust Cloud in
the one—parametrie form and explore its singular points, which are the boundaries of Char—
acteristic behavior regions of the sound velocity. In Sec. IV, we Obtain the DAW dispersion
relation, calculate the sound velocity by derivation of the dust compressibility. We compare
the calculation results with available experimental data in Sec. V. The results of this study
are summarized in See. VI.

II. THE FLUID APPROACH TO SCALABLE COMPLEX PLASMA

Consider a dust Cloud in the low—pressure gas. Under microgravity conditions (either in
parabolic ﬂights or onboard the 188), a dust particle is subject to three basic forces, namely,
the electric driving force, the ion drag force arising from scattering of the streaming ions
on dust particles, and the neutral drag force (friction force) due to collisions of the atoms
with the moving particle. Note that in a strongly coupled system, the correlation energy
originating from particle ordering results in the difference between the volume—averaged
electric ﬁeld and the electric ﬁeld at the point of particle location. This effect can be
included if we introduce the dust pressure. The effect of this pressure on the force balance

"
"6","6
equation in a stationary plasma is discussed in Sec. 111, where we consider the stationary
(unperturbed) state of the dust Cloud.

If we represent the dust component of complex plasma as a ﬂuid, we have the following
basic equations. The ﬁrst one is the Euler equation
8V 1
—-|-(V'V)V-|-VV:—(f€-|-fid—Vp), (1)

where V(t, r) is the velocity ﬁeld, p and p are the pressure and density of a ﬂuid, respectively;
W is the neutral drag force, V : (8V 27? / 3)6mnnn’UTna2 / M is the friction coefﬁcient [6, 45],
6 2 1.4 is the accommodation coefﬁcient; mm is the mass of a gas molecule; mm and ”UT” :

Tn : 300 K is the temperature of a gas, a is the particle radius, M : (47T/3)pda3 is its mass;

ion drag force acting on unit volume, respectively. Here,

where A is the ion mean free path with respect to the collisions against gas atoms, and m- is
the electron number density. Equation (3) explicitly takes into account overlapping of the
Coulomb potentials of neighboring particles [35].
In addition, the ﬂuid of dust particle obeys the continuity equation

For the dust pressure, we use the expression derived in the work [35]

where 71* : (47T/3))\3nd and nd : p / M is the particle number density (we mark dimensionless
quantities with an asterisk). The expression (5) can be rewritten in the form p : Zthnde,
where Zth : F / 6 is the compressibility factor for the dust. Since T >> 1 even for T d >> Tn, we

"
"7","7
have Zth >> 1; practically, Zth > 30. This agrees qualitatively with the results of calculation
for the strongly coupled Yukawa system [46]. Hence, the thermal equation of state for the
dust component is fully deﬁned by its strong coupling. Equation (5) results in a typical
dust pressure of 10—7 + 10—6 Pa, which is in a good agreement with its estimate following
from the assessment of the deformation threshold for a cavity around a large particle in a
complex plasma [44] and 0f the radius of such cavity [35]. The same orders of magnitude of
the dust pressure were determined in the work [38], where the dust acoustic shock waves in
strongly coupled dusty plasma were investigated experimentally.

III. SINGULAR POINTS OF IEOS FOR A STATIONARY DUST CLOUD
As follows from Eq. (1), the stationary state condition for a dust Cloud (V E O) is
f6 ‘i— fid — V]? : 0. (6)
It can be easily shown that the third term on the 1.h.s. of Eq. (6) is much smaller than f6
and fid. Indeed, this term can be represented in the form
dp 2 2
Vp2d—20Vp2MndCV1nnd, (7)
p
where C2 : dp/dp. It is shown below that C is deﬁned by ordinary rather than partial
derivative and its physical meaning as the sound velocity is Clariﬁed in Sec. IV. Since f6 :
—anT€Vh1 716, where [Vin 716] N 1/L and L is the length of the dust Cloud, we have
[f6] N andCIDTe2/Le2 not too Close to the void boundary. Hence, we Obtain from Eq. (7) and
the estimation [Vin 71d] N 1 / L that the condition [f6] >> [Vp] is satisﬁed if
“Mg >> 1 (8)
M C262 '
For the conditions of experiment [20], the 1.h.s. 0f (8) is of the order of 103 (if c : 2.4 em/s).
Thus, Eq. (6) is reduced to f6 + fid : 0 0r

relation between each desired pair of the variables m, 716, nd, and (I) (each relation is IEOS
as well), e.g., the relation between nd and CI). Note that temperatures are included in the
parameter 6 because they are assumed to be ﬁxed. Thus, for treated system, the dust
compressibility is proportional to ordinary rather partial derivative dp/dp, WhiCh implies
that differentiation is performed along the ionization equilibrium line.

responds to two singular points of IEOS. The maximum i011 number density 7132 is reached at
the ﬁrst singular point. Here, 71* has a maximum (Fig. 1). The ﬁrst singular point, WhiCh is
similar to the critical point and can be associated With the void boundary, is deﬁned by the
condition (dn: / dn:)1n*:n* : 0. Since (dCID/an)1n*:n* # 0, this condition can be rewritten
as (dnf/dCID)1q):q)C : 0 (see Fig. 4 in [35]). We substitute n: from (12) in the latter derivative

by the condition (an/dnfﬂnjzn; : 0. Since (dnf/dCIDMqDZqDS # O, we rewrite it in the form

It follows from (19) and (22) that

It is seen in Fig. 2 that the particle number density at the second singular point 71: m 4, and
it is almost independent of 6. At this point, the Havnes parameter is

H8 : 2%. (24)
For example under conditions of the experiment [20], 6 : 0.0431, (1)8 : 1.708, and we Obtain
from (24) H8 : 1.461.

Strictly speaking, at the second singular point, the balance equation (9) is invalid along
with IEOS (12) and (18) because V716 : 0 and the electric ﬁeld E vanishes. However, as
it follows from (8), the width of singular region is of the same order of magnitude as the
interpartiele distance. At this point, E must Change its direction. It is possible that this
region corresponds to that Of inverse ion streaming considered in Ref. [49].

The spatial location Of two singular points can be illustrated in application to the dust
Cloud in RF discharge plasma (e.g., PK—3 Plus [18] or lMPF—K2 [11] experiments). The
conﬁguration of a dust Cloud can be very crudely regarded as a sphere with an empty
spherical region in the center (void). Then we can associate the ﬁrst singular point with the
void boundary and the second singular point, with a sphere of the radius larger than that
Of the void. Thus, we have two spatial regions separated by spherical surfaces, namely, the
region between the ﬁrst and the second singular points and the region outside the second
singular point.

IV. DUST ACOUSTIC WAVES AND THE SOUND VELOCITY

In what follows, we will treat a nonstationary solution of Eqs. (1) and (4) corresponding
to DAW. As usual, we imply that the wavelength 27TC/w, where w is the frequency, is the
largest length scale of the problem and that the wave propagates adiabatieally and can be
treated in the linear approxiamtien. First Of all, we represent the sum f6 + fid in (1) in the
form (96 +gZ-d)E, where 96 : —aT€<I)nd/e and gid : (3/8)(47T/3)1/3n61z/3m)\e (Cf. (2) and (3)).
Then we write 96 : 960 + gé, gid : gido + ggd, and E : E0 + E’, where 960, gido, and E0
are the unperturbed quantities and gé, gz’d, and E’, the perturbed ones. Assuming a small

"
"11","11
perturbation, we write
fa + fid ’1 (.960 + gid0)E0 + (.960 + gid0)E/ + (9; + gid)E0 : (9; + gid)E0 (25)
due to the force balanoe condition 960 + gido : 0. It is noteworthy that this condition cancels
out emactly the ﬁeld perturbation E’. In other terms, although the ﬁeld perturbation is
nonzero, it does not contribute to the equation of ﬂuid dynamics (1). Therefore, the effect
of Charge separation due to the ion shift that determines the sound velocity in equilibrium
plasma [24] is fully compensated in the complex plasma of gas discharge treated in this work.
Thus, the sound velocity is solely deﬁned by the dust compressibility. Similar situation takes
place in strongly coupled Yukawa systems [40].

Calculation of the sum gé+ggd in (25) is a separate problem, which cannot be solved within
the framework of the model [35] we use in this work. In fact, the model assumes that at
least one stationary spatial distribution of the number densities of the Charged components
(electrons, ions, and particles) is known. Hence, in order to evaluate g; + ggd, we have either
to develop a self—oonsistent theory of the complex discharge plasma (which is now lacking)
or to add another assumption to our model, in other words, to redeﬁne the model so that it
would be applicable for dynamic processes. Note that the models of equilibrium plasma and
of strongly coupled Yukawa systems are also deﬁned by a set of assumptions. Our additional
assumption will be 9; : —ggd, which means simply that the variations of all quantities in
the sound wave are related by IEOS (12) or that the electric and ion drag forces are always
kept in balance. This assumption is similar to that made for an ordinary acoustic wave.
What is more important, this assumption allows one to provide an interpretation of the
sound velocity isotropy known from experiment. Indeed, the sound velocity was found to
be independent of the wave propagation direction with respect to the direction of external
electric ﬁeld E0, which is almost radial in some setups. If only 9; 74 —g,£d, the resulting
sound velocity would be anisotropic.

With this assumption, Eq. (1) is reduced to

88—: + (V - V)V + W = —%VP- (26)
Actually, (26) corresponds to a ﬂuid of soft spheres with no Coulomb interaction. This
equation was successfully applied for the problem of dust particle collective dynamics [37,
43, 44]. Equation (26) differs from the standard wave equation by the neutral drag force

term on its 1.h.s. We linearize Eqs. (26) and (4) following the common procedure [50] by
substitution of p : p0 + p’ and p : p0 + p’ , Where p0 and p0 are the stationary (unperturbed)
pressure and density of the dust particles and p’ and p’ are their perturbations, respectively.

where 71*1/3 : (8/3)(1 — QCIDeq’). Note that the sound velocity (along with the particle
compressibility) is a continuous function at the second singular point.

Using (13) and (35) one can easily show that C2(<I>C) : O, C2 > 0 at (I) > CDC, and C2 < 0
at (I) < CDC. Since n*(<I>) is a decreasing function, in the latter case n > 716. We can conclude
that the corresponding branch of solutions of Eq. (12) relates to an unstable state of the
dust Cloud with a negative compressibility. Such state would tend to collapse and to quench
the discharge. Hence, we conﬁne ourselves to the treatment of a positive compressibility
branch with (I) > CIDC and n < 710.

According to (35) the sound velocity is a function of the spatial coordinate. This de—
pendence can be qualitatively illustrated if we consider the dependence C(nZ) determined by
(12) and (35) (Fig. 3). It is seen that the sound velocity is almost independent of the ion
number density, i.e., 0f the coordinate in the volume of the dust Cloud. This is accounted
for by the fact that the particle pressure (5) increases but the particle potential decreases
with the increase of the dust number density. The increase in 71* is almost compensated by
the decrease in CI). Thus, C(nZ) has a very wide maximum with the maximum point situated
approximately in the center of a Cloud (Fig. 3). The variation of C(nZ) is so small that the
entire curve lies within the band, in which the sound velocity measured at different locations
inside the dust Cloud are scattered [20]. This accounts for the fact that the dependence of
sound velocity on the coordinate was not resolved in experiments. It is also seen in Fig. 3
that in the Close vicinity of the inner boundary of the Cloud, which we associate with the
ﬁrst singular point, C vanishes very sharply. Apparently, behavior of C in this region cannot
be resolved experimentally as well.

Obviously, the average sound velocity is Close to its value at the second singular point CS.

As it follows from (36), CS is weakly dependent on the particle radius a.

V. THE ANALYSIS OF EXPERIEMNTAL DATA

In Fig. 4, we compare the calculation using formula (36) with the available results of
experiments, where the sound velocity was determined. In these experiments performed
under microgravity conditions both in parabolic ﬂights and onboard the 188, a 3D dust
Cloud was formed in argon RF discharge. One can testify a satisfactory agreement between
proposed theory and experiment in a wide range of the particle diameter. Note a very
weak dependence of CS on this parameter. According to (36), this follows not only from the
dependence CS N l/ﬁ but also from CS N l/ﬁ and from the fact that the experimental
pressure is higher for lager particles. A good correlation between (36) and experiment is
illustrated by Fig. 3, where the range of n: variation corresponds to the experiment [20] (for
the spatial distributions of m- and ml in the dust Cloud, see [35]). The variation of sound
velocity is noticeably smaller than the experimental data scatter.

Figure 4 also shows the results of calculation using the formula C : W
[24]. For the correctness of comparison, we estimate C at the second singular point. Thereby,
we include the effect of particle Charge decrease as compared to the Charge of an isolated
particle, which is sometimes called “the Charge cannibalism” [51, 52]. Using (24) we obtain
for this point

2
cs: é%ﬁfbﬂ (37)
Note that (37) is entirely different from (36). Figure 4 shows that formula (37) demonstrates
a trend incompatible with that of experimental data. Estimates show a signiﬁcant variation
of the sound velocity [24] as a function of the position in the dust Cloud. Under the conditions
of experiment [20], C would Change by a factor of 1.6, which could be detected (of. Fig. 4).
Thus, one can testify a better overall applicability of formula (35).

In the ongoing PK—4 experiments, dust Clouds are predominantly formed in the do (or
combined do + RF) discharge in neon. First, it is necessary to Check if IEOS used in
this work is applicable for such systems. The results of calculation of the “dust invariant”
H; : rg/aTe, which was introduced in [35] for the argon RF discharge, for conditions of PK—4
experiment with neon is presented in Table I. It is seen that H; is not much different for
neon and argon (H; : 0.209 oIn/eV [35]). This makes it possible to apply formula (36) for
the prediction of typical sound velocities in the PK—4 experiments. It is worth mentioning
that for 2a : 1.2 gm, H; is twice as high as for 68 ,um (Table I). This may indicate a poor

applicability of the approximation of scalable complex plasma for the smallest particles
(2a < 2 ,urn). The reason why the theory may ﬂaw in this range of diameters may lie in
the fact that for the smallest particles, the Debye length and the momentum transfer cross
section for an isolated particle are no longer greater than rd, so that the Coulomb potentials
of neighboring particles do not overlap [35]. Therefore, the momentum transfer cross section
of the ion scattering on particles may be different from that used in this work. Another one
reason may be the higher electron temperature as compared to argon at low neon pressure.
Under such conditions, the ion drag force can be proportional to the square of the electric
ﬁeld, which is not taken into account in used formula for the ion drag force (3). One can
also suggest the mechanisms of particle Charging other than OML approximation, which can
effectively Change 6. Thus, in PK—4 experiments, one can expect the sound velocity ranging
from 2 to 3 orn/s with a weak trend to the increase with the increase in pressure and the
decrease in particle diameter, while greater velocities seem to be overestimated in Table I. It
is worth mentioning that for neon, formula (37) would lead to the sound velocities ranging
from 0.89 to 7.33 orn/s.

Unfortunately, no direct measurement of the sound velocity was performed in PK—4 ex—
periments. However, the experimental data on dust acoustic shock waves are best ﬁtted at
the sound velocity of 2.5 orn/s [38]. For melamine formaldehyde particles of the diameter
2a : 3.4 ,urn used in this experiment, pn : 15 Pa, and T e : 7 eV, formula (36) yields a Close
value CS : 2.76 orn/s.

The sound velocity was measured for the RF discharge in neon in the PK—3 Plus eX—

"
"16","16
periment [34]. For the silica particles of the diameter 2a : 1.55 am, the neon pressure
pn : 15 Pa, and the electron temperature Te : 7 eV (6 : 0.0858), the sound velocity re—
ported in [34] is CS : 0.96 CIn/s. For this set of parameters, formula (36) yields CS : 3.6 CIn/s
and (37), CS : 5.7 CIn/s. Despite the result of (36) is signiﬁcantly Closer to the experiment, it
is still rather inappropriate. To ﬁnd the reason of such discrepancy, we will analyze the basic
limits of validity of scalable complex plasma formulated in [35]. The Coulomb momentum
transfer cross section for an isolated particle N (aTe/Tiéb)2 must be much greater than the
cross section of the particle Wigner—Seitz cell N 7121- At the second singular point, we have
from (23) rd % 0.63)\, and this condition can be written as

2.5 (af—TTY >> 1. (38)
The second condition requires that the maximum impact parameter of ion scattering on
an isolated particle with due regard for the Debye screening (2CIDaADTe/T,)1/2, where AD :
(T,-/47T7""L,-e2)1/2 is the ion Debye screening length, is much larger than rd. At the second
singular point, we use (21) and (23) to write this condition as
1 2
0.33<I>;/2?::‘9—:f (6%) / >> 1. (39)
As is seen from (38) and (39), the limit of validity of used theory is reached at sufﬁciently
small particle diameters. Under the experimental conditions [34], the 1.h.s. 0f (38) and (39)
are Close to unity, therefore, the theory may ﬂaw in this region.

In addition to the reasons of the inapplicability 0f (36) for the smallest particles discussed
above, one can assume that in the presence of the particles in RF discharge, the electron
temperature can be lower than that in the absence of the particles, i.e., less than 7 eV.
However, for the experiment [34], there is a good agreement between the damping rates
of DAW ﬁrst measured for a 3D dust Cloud and the theoretical result V/ 2 (see (32)). In
fact, for pn : 20 Pa, the damping rates are 43 and 46 s‘1 from the theory and experiment,
respectively, and for 19,, : 15 Pa, 33 and 32 s_l.

VI. CONCLUSION

To summarize, we have calculated the sound velocity corresponding to DAW in a nenequi—
libriuin stationary 3D dust Cloud formed in the low pressure aC/de discharge under micro—
gravity conditions. The dust Cloud is assumed to conform to the model of scalable complex

"
"17","17
plasma, which treats a stationary state of the dust Cloud as a balance between the electric
force from an external electric ﬁeld of the discharge and the ion drag force. The ioniza—
tion state of such a system is fully deﬁned by the one—parametrie IEOS, which can relate
each pair of four dimensionless variables. To ﬁnd Characteristic regions of behavior of the
sound velocity, we determine two singular point of this IEOS related to the maximum of
the ion and electron number densities, respectively. We use the ﬂuid approach (the Euler
and continuity equations) to account for the dynamics of the dust plasma component. We
have demonstrated that in the presence of the external electric ﬁeld, the ﬁeld perturbation
associated with the sound wave is dominated by the gradient of the dust pressure, which
emerges due to the particle correlations in a strongly coupled system. Thus, the sound
velocity is fully determined by the compressibility of the dust Cloud. We have shown that
only one branch of two IEOS solutions that implies the high particle potentials and low
number densities can realize. We have included the neutral drag term in the Euler equation
to derive a dispersion relation that makes it possible to estimate the damping rate of a sound
wave. Based on this equation, we calculated the dependence of the sound velocity on the ion
number density, which mimics a real spatial distribution of this quantity in the dust Cloud.
The sound velocity was found to be almost independent of the coordinate and its average,
to be reached at the second singular point.

Comparison with available experimental data reveals a good correspondence with the
measurements of sound velocity. Obtained formula for this quantity can account for all
experimentally Observed regularities, such as the independence of the coordinate, of the
particle radius, and 0f the gas pressure. The damping rates of a dust Cloud in neon are also
is a good agreement with experiment.

A comparison with the well—known result of Ref. [24] performed at the same point of the
plasma ionization state diagram, thus including the effect of particle Charge lowering, shows
the trend entirely different from experimentally Observed one. For small particle diameters,
the calculated sound velocity is more than twice as high as the experimental ones and for
large diameters, Vice versa. This is not surprising because the result [24] is quite correct for
equilibrium ideal plasma in the absence of an external electric ﬁeld. In contrast, our system
is strongly nenequilibrium and strongly coupled.

In regard to the PK—4 experiment, the analyses of up—tO—date data demonstrates that the
dust Cloud in neon can be quantiﬁed by the “dust invariant” of our scalable model, which

"
"18","18
have approximately the same value for different dust Clouds in neon. Its value is Close to that
typical for PK—3 Plus experiments. This allows one to make some prognostic estimations
of the sound velocity, Which can be helpful in the analysis Of dust acoustic shock wave
propagation. A best ﬁt sound velocity that follows from such analysis [38] almost coincides
With that calculated in this work.

A single experimental data, Which proved to be incompatible With the proposed theory, is
a 10W sound velocity in the PK—3 Plus experiment With neon [34], Which is more than twice
as low as the theoretical estimation. We show that our theory is valid for sufﬁciently large
particles but the dust particles used in the experiment [34] are too small for the theory. A
correct approach to the theory of a Cloud of small particles requires treatment of the Yukawa
rather than the Coulomb system, although the corresponding model may not be scalable.
This problem Will be addressed in future.
