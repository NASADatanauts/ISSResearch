Abstract
The radiation environment in space is very different from the one encountered on Earth. In addition to the sparsely ionizing radiation,
there are particles of different Z With energies ranging from keV up to hundreds of GeV Which can cause severe damage to both elec—
tronics and humans. It is therefore important to understand the interactions of these highly ionizing particles with different materials
such as the hull of space vehicles, human organs and electronics. We have used the Particle and Heavy—Ion Transport code System
(PHITS), which is a three—dimensional Monte Carlo code able to calculate interactions and transport of particles and heavy ions with
energies up to 100 GeV/nucleon in most matter. PHITS is developed and maintained by a collaboration between RIST (Research Orga—
nization for Information Science & Technology), J AEA (J apan Atomic Energy Agency), KEK (High Energy Accelerator Research Orga—
nization), Japan and Chalmers University of Technology, Sweden. For the purpose of examining the applicability of PHITS to the
shielding design we have simulated the ESA facility Matroshka (MTR) designed and lead by the German Aerospace Center (DLR). Pre—
liminary results are presented and discussed in this paper.

Sun. Particle ﬂuxes for protons up to nickel With energy
range from lMeV/nueleon up to 100 GeV/nueleon are
implemented as a source into PHITS, Where an external
isotropic ﬁeld is created Within a sphere Where all the geom-
etries are placed. The simulations are split in two, one With
a source of only trapped protons and the second With a
source of only GCR elements. One problem When creating
the GCR source is a statistical issue. Based on the output
of CREME96, the abundances of the particles are calcu-
lated and Within PHITS these abundances are weighted
as function of Z2. The contribution to absorbed dose from
the primary particles and its daughters are then weighted
