Spontaneous capillary ﬂows in containers of increasing complexity are currently under
investigation to determine important transients for low-g propellant management.
Signiﬁcant progress has been made for complex containers that are cylindrical, but many
practical systems involve geometries that are tapered. For example, the taper of an irregular
polygonal cross section provides particular design advantages by preferentially locating the
liquid Where desired and by providing a passive means for ﬂuid phase separation. Passive
capillary ﬂow in such containers is termed imbibition and cannot be studied easily on the
ground for large, signiﬁcantly 3-D geometries. For certain ﬂows the governing equations are
known but have not been solved analytically to date due to a lack of experimental data
identifying the appropriate boundary conditions for the ﬂow. The results of drop tower
experiments are used in part to support the analysis of imbibition in tapered polygonal
sections, and, in particular, a variety of regular n-gonal pyramids. The theory can be used to
aid in the design and analysis of capillary devices such as 3-D vane networks for bubble-free
collection and positioning of fuels for satellites, an important problem concerning propellant
and/or cryogenic liquid management aboard spacecraft.
I. Introduction
CAPILLARY-driven ﬂows along the interior corners of Z
containers have been studied in detail and a selection
of geometries and ﬂow scenarios were recently reviewedl. 57
Many such ﬂows are applicable to ﬂuids management ‘ ‘
aboard spacecraft. For example, a typical ﬂow is shown in
Figure 1 Where a right cylinder of polygonal section is 1
partially ﬁlled With a wetting ﬂuid and released in a drop 2 /
tower. The ﬂuid is drawn along the corners by capillary 0 I
forces in the low-g environment and advances at a rate
proportional to tm. The ﬂuid rapidly establishes a constant |
height (a.k.a. constant pressure) at a speciﬁc location in the
container as denoted by H in the ﬁgure. This ﬁxed height |< >| |‘ »| |< >|

11. Model and Equation Formulation

A simpliﬁed analysis of the ﬂow is possible by employing a fair number of modeling assumptions at local and
global levels. These are ﬁrst listed below before they are applied in the mathematical development. Similar
approaches have been employed to analyze capillary ﬂows in contracting square pores related to transport in porous
media4’5’6.

II.1 Global Assumptions
1. An ullage in a tapered container is represented schematically in Figure 3a. For small taper angles the container
axis coordinate Z may be approximated by comer axis coordinate 2’ such that Z’ = Z + 0( w). This assumption
requires l//<< 1.
2. Referring to Figure 3a, provided the volume of the ullage is large compared to the volume of the ullage contained
solely within the regions of bulk meniscus curvature (R1 and R2), the ullage may be modeled as one with ﬂat ends as
shown in Figure 3b. It can be shown that this assumption is valid for the most part provided the taper angle is small,
w << 1. Further support for this assumption will be provided herein. The leading and trailing bulk menisci are
identiﬁed at positions 2 and 1 as shown on Figure 3a and represented by 22 and 21 in Figure 3b, respectively.
3. The local radius of curvature and thus the pressure in the liquid at the leading and trailing bulk menisci may be
determined by the method of de Lazzer et al.2’3’7 This assumption permits the clean and closed-form calculation of
the constant height boundary condition h1(zl) and h2(22) required for solution of the local problem and allows the
bulk meniscus leading and trailing locations to be modeled by 22(t) and 21(t). Fortunately, this assumption also
requires the same constraint as assumption #1, gy<< 1. Experimental support for this assumption applied to tapered
geometries is provided by way of simple drop tower tests to be highlighted in summary.
4. Not necessarily in general, but for the purposes of the present analysis a further restriction is made to tapered
section types where, at any section along the ullage, the total cross ﬂow area A of the spreading ﬂuid is small
compared to the container cross-section area AS. Thus, A/AS << 1 and represents a low liquid saturation at any section
across the ullage. As will be discussed in context with Figure 4, A/AS E ,8 << 1 is maintained for a large number of

[1.2 Local Assumptions
The local ﬂow problem concerns the capillary driven interior corner ﬂow from the leading bulk meniscus region
of the ullage at 22 t0 the trailing region at 21, Figures 3 and 4. The local ﬂow is represented schematically in Figure 5
and might be effectively modeled provided several conditions are satisﬁed.
5. The liquid columns that ﬂow along the corners are assumed slender. This assumption requires that 6‘2 << 1, Where
6‘ = hz/(Zz - 21) is the slenderness ratio. This assumption allows the lubrication approximation to describe the corner
ﬂow.
6. For slender columns, streamwise curvature of the interface in the Z-direction can be ignored provided 6‘2f << 1
Where f is a cross-stream geometric curvature function to be deﬁned (R = ﬁHi). This assumption is frequently
satisﬁed by the previous assumption 6‘2 << 1 and, With the lubrication approximation, reduces the Navier-Stokes and
mass conservation equations to a single transient 1-D nonlinear diffusion equation for the interface height h(z,t)
along the corner. (Note that hi1 = 111(21):) and hi2 = hi(Z29t) .)
7. Inertia in the corner ﬂows is assumed negligible. This assumption is frequently satisﬁed by the slender column
assumption 6‘2 << 1 as well.
8. The inﬂuence of gravity on the ﬂow is presently neglected.

I. ,8,- ~ ,8 ~ 0(1): This scenario implies that the global and local time scales are of similar order and the system of
equations is strongly coupled requiring a fully numerical approach.

constant or not a function of Z. Either way the result is no

"10","IV. Discussion of Solution and Constraints
From the expanded eqs. (50) and (54) it is apparent that the trailing meniscus ﬁrst progresses as ~ t*“3 and then
later as ~ t"" , While the leading meniscus moves as ~ t* for the majority of the ﬂow, eqs. (51) and (54). As observed
from eq. (47) and Figure 8, the ﬂow rate across the ullage increases in inverse proportion to the ullage length. At
t"" z 1, a ten-fold reduction in ullage length results in a ten-fold increase in ﬂow rate across the ullage.
For t* —> oo , from Figure 7 the ullage appears to lose its slender nature in Violation of the model and signiﬁcant
3-D curvature effects are expected to dominate the ﬂow Which Will eventually produce a stationary spherical bubble
if the container is long enough. At the other end of the spectrum, for t"" —> 0 , from Figure 9 the unbounded trailing
meniscus velocity dz; / dt"" is unphysical and speaks to the fact that at such short times the global trailing meniscus
time scale is of similar order to the local corner ﬂow time scale also in Violation of the model Which assumes ,8 << 1.
The solution of eqs. (49), (53), and (46) may be used in turn to provide more quantitative time regimes under
Which the modeling assumptions are valid. For example, for pyramidal vessels it can be shown that the most pivotal
global assumption #2 is satisﬁed provided

Which for ﬁxed geometry obviously becomes increasingly difﬁcult to satisfy as 22* increases in time. However, it
may also be shown that F123 / F AS ~tan1/x , and that this constraint is readily satisﬁed for 22* ~ 0(1) provided wis small
enough (global assumption #1).
The most pivotal local modeling assumption is the slender column assumption #5. Again, for pyramidal vessels,
it can be shown that this constraint requires

Which for fixed geometry again becomes increasingly difﬁcult to satisfy both as 22* increases in time and as 22* _ 21*
decreases in time. Nonetheless, it can be shown that FR2 / fl? N tan2 9” Which readily maintains the constraint of eq.

IV.2 Impact of Geometry
The intricate dependence of the ﬂow on container geometry can be interrogated by the present analysis. For
example, redimensionalizing the ﬂow rate for t* <<1 for the equi-Wi pyramidal sections and the non-pyramidally
tapered section described above yields

crossﬂowarea velocityscale
ngo is a dimensional ﬂow rate coefﬁcient separated into cross ﬂow area and velocity scale components in eq. (68).
The length scale L appears in the cross ﬂow area term and serves as a measure of capillary length through hz (22 = L)
and not Viscous length. The velocity component may be broken down further into the slenderness ratio F R/ﬁ, the
capillary velocity 0m, and the geometric ratio of the capillary to Viscous force, FnSinz 0% /f;,. Viscous effects are
contained only Within the velocity scale term in eq. (68), Where no length dimensions appear because the Viscous
length, also Characterized by L, is cancelled by the same capillary driving force length scale ~ L. Thus, ngo serves as
the measure of the ﬂow intensity at small times and provides a clear path for comparisons of like geometries or for
optimizations given certain container, conduit, or pore dimensions. F geo is a dimensionless geometric function that
collects purely geometric quantities.
IV.3 Application
To demonstrate the value and ease With Which container, conduit, or pore geometries are compared, a brief
analysis of equi-length, equi-volume, n-regular pyramidal containers is provided here. By ﬁxing L, w can be varied
such that all such containers possess the same volume and can be compared on this basis. Such a comparison is
effectively one of comparing iso-porosity structures in Which pore geometry is the sole distinguishing characteristic.
A sketch of three n-sided regular pyramidal containers is provided in Figure 11. F geo from eq. (68) is

container type,

and
F PS = 2ntan1/1 sina tan(7r/ 2) (72)
from which F R may be computed Via eq. (14). F ge0'(105/F i) is plotted against 1/n in Figure 12. For cases Where 12 >>

that transport rates are readily observed to be strong functions of geometry. In this case for instance a change from a
square (n = 4) conduit to an equilateral triangular one (n = 3) of identical volume and length produces a
corresponding 5.6-fold increase in ﬂow rate across the cell, (4/3)6. A similar change from a hexagon to a triangle
yields a 64-fold increase (6/3)6.

"13","V. Supportive Drop Tower Experiments
Evidence supporting the ﬂat bulk meniscus modeling assumption #3 applied to right cylindrical vessels is
provided in earlier works on the subject3’7’9. Support for application of this assumption t0 the tapered containers
investigated herein is provided in Figure 13 Where 2.2s drop tower tests at NASA’s Glenn Research Center are
conducted for the sudden imbibition problem in a uniformly tapered right isosceles pyramid (compare With Figure
1). As shown in Figure 14 tests performed at several initial ﬁll levels to determine the meniscus advance location are
well predicted by current theory (~ tl/z) Which assumes that the method of de Lazzer et al.2’7 may be applied to
compute the surface height boundary condition (bulk meniscus curvature) at the coordinate origin for the ﬂow.
Unfortunately, for these tests w is sufﬁciently small such that the predicted and measured slopes in Figure 14 do not
vary signiﬁcantly between tests. As a result, the experiments only provide ‘support’ for the use of the de Lazzer
method to compute the constant height H(Z) location for the ﬂow. Proof of this claim awaits further experiments
over a broader range of geometric parameters.
Summary
An analytic approach predicting liquid ﬂow rates and/or ullage migration rates in partially ﬁlled containers,
conduits, 0r pores that are slightly tapered is presented. Closed form solutions are offered for the special case of
symmetric pyramidally-tapered sections where A, ~ 22, and for the special case of symmetric, tapered section of high
aspect ratio where A, ~ 2. The 0(1) analytic solutions permit relatively easy comparisons and optimizations for
various container shapes as demonstrated herein for pyramids of n-sided regular polygonal section. The method can
be used as a tool to design speciﬁc capillary ﬂuid elements for large length scale systems such as spacecraft fuel
tanks, as well as to design microﬂuidic systems such as high performance porous Wicks.
