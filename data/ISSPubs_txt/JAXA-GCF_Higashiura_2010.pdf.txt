1. Introduction
In recent years, macromolecular X-ray crystallography has
been advanced signiﬁcantly by the use of high-brilliance and
low-divergence synchrotron beams, high-performance and
high-precision large area detectors, cryocooling techniques
and state-of—the-art data-reduction programs and mathe-
matical improvement of the reﬁnement software. Improve-
ment of the methods and techniques of protein
crystallography has increased the resolution limit and thus the
quality of protein structures (Dauter et al., 1997; Schmidt &
Lamzin, 2002; Dauter, 2003; Vrielink & Sampson, 2003;
Petrova & Podjarny, 2004). To date, the protein structures that
have been reﬁned against the highest resolution data include
crambin (Jelsch et al., 2000), hen egg-white lysozyme (Wang et
al., 2007) and human aldose reductase (Howard et al., 2004) at
resolutions of 0.54, 0.65 and 0.66 A, respectively. As of
February 2010, ~250 structures at higher than 1.0 A resolution
have been deposited in the Protein Data Bank (PDB; Berman
et al., 2000, 2002) out of a total of 63 000 structures. Examples
of high-resolution X-ray crystallography are still not
numerous: only 92 structures (<0.15% 0f the total) are beyond
0.9 A resolution.
The number of measurements (namely, diffraction data)
required for structure determination at 0.9 A resolution is
