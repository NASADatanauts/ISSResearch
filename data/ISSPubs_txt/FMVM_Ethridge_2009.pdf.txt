The purpose of FMVM was to measure the rate of coalescence of two highly Viscous
liquid drops and correlate the results with the liquid Viscosity and surface tension. The
experiment takes advantage of the low gravitational force free ﬂoating conditions in space
allowing the unconstrained coalescence of two nearly spherical drops. The merging of the
drops is accomplished by deploying them from a syringe and suspension on Nomex threads.
An astronaut’s slow manipulation of one of the drops toward a stationary droplet till there is
contact initiates the droplet coalescence. Coalescence and merging occurs due to shape
relaxation and reduction of surface energy, being resisted by the Viscous drag within the
liquid. Experiments were conducted onboard the International Space Station in J uly of 2004
and subsequently in May of 2005. The coalescence was recorded on Video and down-linked
near real—time. When the coefﬁcient of surface tension for the liquid is known, the increase
in contact radius can be used to determine the coefﬁcient of Viscosity for that liquid. The
Viscosity is determined by ﬁtting the time to achieve contact neck diameter equal to half of
the initial droplet diameter. This time is compared with a relaxation time scaling coefﬁcient
to arrive at the liquid Viscosity. Recent ﬂuid dynamical numerical simulations with
COMSOL MultiPhysics of the coalescence process will be presented. The results are
important for a better understanding of the coalescence process. The experiment is also
relevant to liquid phase sintering, free form in-situ fabrication, and as a potential new
method for measuring the Viscosity of Viscous glass formers at low shear rates.

"2","I. Introduction

In response to the call for low uprnass experiments, on of the authors (EE) the PI of the NRA “Mechanisms
for the Crystallization of ZBLAN” proposed the “Fluid Merging Viscosity Measurement” (FMVM) experiment for
the International Space Station (188). FMVM was a natural follow on to experiments for examining the
determination of Viscosity of highly Viscous liquids using two drop coalescence. The main purpose of the
experiment is to advance a totally new and different method for Viscosity measurement. Currently the measurement
of Viscosity is limited for liquids that are susceptible to crystallization. A method for determining the Viscosity of
highly Viscous substances that are susceptible to crystallization over the most important Viscosity range for
crystallization behaVior does not eXist. A method suitable to eontainerless processing to avoid container walls to
heterogeneous nucleation is needed. The process should use relatively small samples for quickly getting the material
to temperature and to quickly measure the Viscosity. Even though FMVM uses strings to maintain control of the
liquid spheres, it is anticipated that one of the containerless processing methods could be utilized in low gravity for
completely eontainerless property rneasurernent.1 FMVM was only meant to validate the principle.

The relaxation of liquid to a sphere is one potential method for determining the Viscosity of very Viscous liquids.
During the coalescence of two spheres of liquids to one sphere, the ﬂuid ﬂow is driven by the reduction of surface
energy but limited by the resistance to ﬂuid ﬂow by the liquid Viscosity. The FMVM experiment was supported by
prior coalescence experiments on the low gravity KC-l35 parabolic aircraft. Low gravity exploratory experiments
were performed with glycerin on KC-l35 aircraft for short (10 see) experiment tirnes.1’ 2

The time constant of the experiment is proportional to the Viscosity. Frenkel3 was the ﬁrst to propose an
analytical model for the coalescence of two spheres where the coalescence time constant is proportional to the liquid
Viscosity and coalescence time and inversely proportional to surface tension. But, due to the limitations of his
analytical solution, Frankel was able to model only the initial phases of the coalescence process of two spherical
drops. Subsequently many others have developed analytical models of the coalescence process.5'8

The FMVM method is also interesting because it can be tested by computational ﬂuid mechanics. Numerical
models including Boundary Element Method (BEM) simulations have successfully modeled coalescence.9 Using
BEM,1’2’10’11 Antar was able develop an accurate numerical solution for the coalescence of both two inﬁnitely long
cylindrical drops as well as two spherical drops. In fact the BEM is capable of accurately modeling the coalescence
process for any two liquid masses of arbitrary initial shapes. It was shown that the rate of coalescence can be
Characterized by the rate of neck diameter growth. A comparison of the 2 dimensional cylinder model with the 3-D
sphere model showed slightly different neck diameter growth rates. Coaleseing spheres grow slower than cylinders.
The KC-l35 experimental data ﬁt the 3-D spherical coalescence model up to a normalized neck diameter of 0.5.
Since the experiment constrained the drops keeping them from forming a sphere, the ﬁnal shape was a cylindrical
liquid bridge and above the 0.5 normalized neck diameter, the data ﬁt the 2-D cylindrical model. The objective of
FMVM was to examine the coalescence of 2 Viscous drops beyond the limitations of the KC-l35 experiments. The
188 provided the opportunity for much longer experiments, much larger sarnples, rnore Viscous liquids, and
unconstrained ﬂuid motion in the weightless conditions in space.

COMSOL MultiPhysies is a Finite Element Analysis (FEA) software package with preprograrnrned solution
tools that permits the solution processes with coupled physical phenomena. It was determined that COMSOL could
be applied to the coalescence of liquid droplets with physical properties identical to the FMVM conditions. These
numerical experiments could then be compared with FMVM experimental data.

11. Fluid Merging Viscosity Measurement ISS Experiment

The experimental design parameters are quite simple. Using supplies on the ISS, setup an apparatus to attach 2
strings on which liquid drops were deployed to maintain control. The experiment required the measurement of the
initial diameters of the 2 drops and use an on—board digital camcorder to record the coalescence of the drops.
Subsequent analysis of the recorded tape provided measurements of the time dependent Change in the neck diameter
with coalescence time. Several low toxicity Viscous ﬂuids spanning 2 orders of magnitude Viscosity range were
selected. The manifested ﬂuids were contained in syringes that were also used to deploy the liquids onto the
strings. The liquids included honey, corn syrup, glycerin, and two different silicone oil Viscosity standards. The
surface tension of the ﬂight liquids was determined both by the pendant drop methods and the drop-weight and the
Viscosity was measured with a Brookﬁeld rotating spindle viscometer calibrated with Viscosity standards.

"3","On—orbit resources such as the MicrograVity Work Apparatus (MWA) Utility Kit (Figure 1), were utilized for
the experimental setup. The experiment was contained inside the MWA (Figure 2). A conﬁguration was tested on
the ground during preparation for operations on the 188. The on—orbit supplies were conﬁgured to hold the
background grid card, and provide support for the Nomex strings that held the drops. A Fluke 190 Scopemeter with
temperature probe was used to measure the temperature of the liquid drops. A mini—Maglite provided illumination of
the liquid drops. The experiment was contained inside the MWA (Figure 2). Figure 3 illustrates the ﬁnal
experimental setup that was used on the 188. The experimental procedures were developed and test by the PI at J SC
in order to provide detailed descriptions of how the experimental assembly was set up. Crew procedures were also
written to lead the astronaut through the experimental scenario.

III. COMSOL MultiPhysics

COMSOL MultiPhysics is a ﬁnite element analysis software tool that permits modeling of a large number of
physical and chemical phenomena. Different types of physics (thermal, ﬂuid ﬂow, physical forces, etc.) can be
integrated into the FEA solution to solve complicated interrelated phenomena. The COMSOL Chemical
Engineering module automates the Navier-Stokes ﬁnite element calculations applicable to liquid droplet
coalescence. The “Level Set TWO-Phase Flow” application in COMSOL made it possible to set up and model the
ﬂuid ﬂow in coalescing spherical droplets and to track the interface between the two ﬂuids (air and liquid sample).
The discontinuity across the interface is widened and represented by a contour of the globally deﬁned level set
function, (I). The “Rising Bubble Modeled With the Level Set Method” located in the COMSOL Chemical
Engineering menu was used to learn how to use the level set method and the initial conditions were used as a
starting point for the calculations to model our coalescence experiments.

For the level set method, COMSOL MultiPhysics uses a smooth step function across the interface between 2
ﬂuids (air and liquid droplets in our case). The actual interface is deﬁned as (l) = 0.5 With air occupying the domain
Where 0 < (l) < 0.5 and the liquid occupying 0.5 < (l) < 1. During the calculation the level set function is continuously
reinitialized so that it keeps the correct shape across the interface. In the method, the actual ﬂuid interface is deﬁned
as the isoline 0f the level set function at (l) = 0.5.

coalescence solved. Once we got the model running
without errors. The material constants were
changed for parametric analysis modeling of silicone oil and honey representative of the FMVM ISS experiments.
For different initial sphere diameters, the geometry would have to be modiﬁed, which requires returning to the initial
geometric setup. Due to the difﬁculty with changes in the geometric setup and the different optimization parameters
for each geometry, the results presented here are for 1 cm diameter spheres only. Experimental scenarios similar to
188 experiments can be calculated by the different values of Viscosity, surface tension, and liquid density. Two
values of surface tension and density, representative of the two liquids (silicone oil Viscosity standard and honey)
were used for calculations using a large range of viscosities (spanning up to 4 orders of magnitude, see Table II).

COMSOL calculations were performed for each of these 7 different conditions and an AVI movie ﬁle with the
time sequence for coalescence created and saved. Each AVI was examined to determine the time constant at which
the neck, diameter was half the original drop diameter, t0.5D. In this study, this is deﬁned as the characteristic
relaxation time for “half coalescence”. The time increment calculation produces a sequence that can be saved as an
AVI movie ﬁle. Figure 7 shows a sequence of still images from the calculation for two 1 cm diameter honey
droplets with a Viscosity of 12,500 cP, 1.45 g/cc density, 90 erg/crn2 surface energy. The level set gradient
boundary is illustrated by the color bands from red to blue. The FMVM Video and calculated AVI analysis for this
paper was performed manually and is very subj ective. The determination of t0_5D from the COMSOL AVI required
the determination of the “line” between yellow and green in the level set boundary in the color plot. The COMSOL
software includes extensive postprocessing and Visualization capabilities that we have not fully implemented at this
time. Upon receipt of the new version of the software a precise determination of the interface can be calculated
automatically for more “exact” determination of t0_5D.

Comparison of the time to reach half coalescence, tow, in the FMVM ISS experiment Video with the COMSOL
AVI calculation shows the potential of COMSOL modeling of the coalescence process. For silicone oil with a
Viscosity equal to 12,500 cP, the time for half coalescence, t0_5D , is 2 seconds for both the FMVM experiment and
for the COMSOL calculation.

The most simple expression for coalescence is Frenkel’s relation2 where the time of coalescence, t, is proportional
to the viscosity, 1], and droplet diameter, D, and inversely proportional to surface tension, 6,

t ~ (11 D ) / 6
Actually, a proportunallity constant is required for the Frenkel expression. The simplest expression for the time to
half coalescence can be written as,

t0.5D = C0.5D ( n D ) / 5
Solving for time constant to half coalescence, C0_5D,was calculated for each set of conditions in Table 11. These
were averaged to obtain a proportionality constant, C051), of 0.0067. Using this relation with the liquid properties, a
theoretical time constant for each coalescence was calculated. The time constant measured from the calculated AVI
coalescence Video is in reasonable agreement with the theoretical time constant (except for the highest Viscosity
silicone oil), considering the very subj ective nature of the determination of tow. Error with the calculated tow for
the highest Viscosity silicone oil may be due to a problem with the COMSOL calculation. It was observed that the
level set interface between air and oil for this calculation was greatly disrupted and the calculation is probably in
error because of invalid initial calculation parameters in the model.

These results in general validate the original premise that the characteristic coalescence time constant is
proportional to the liquid Viscosity and the initial sphere diameter but inversely proportional to the surface tension.
These results, when averaged, give the same proportionality constant equal to 0.0067 for a liquid with the properties
of silicone oil and honey. This initial evaluation indicates that by measuring the time constant for coalescence (time
for coalescence to reach a neck diameter half of the original drop diameter), it will be possible to determine the
Viscosity from an unknown liquid assuming the surface tension is known reasonably well.

The FMVM coalescence experiment has now come full circle. It started 10 years ago with low gravity KC-l35
experiments and evolved into the ISS FMVM experiment. As the analysis of the 188 data nears completion, low
gravity student DC9 aircraft experiments are continuing the experimental side of the science. This data will also be
compared with COMSOL numerical experiments in the near future.

"7","IV. Conclusions
FMVM successfully examined the unconstrained ﬂuid ﬂow behavior of 2 coalescing drops in low gravity on the
International Space Station with a number of different Viscous liquids. It had been shown that the contact neck
diameter calculated by boundary element method agrees with 188 results. Likewise in this report, parametric
analysis using COMSOL FEA calculations of the coalescence of two drops was shown to agree with FMVM 188
results. A ﬁrst order analysis Of the FMVM data with numerical calculations was examined. A proportionality
constant was determined, which when added to Frenkel’s relation permitted the calculation of a Frenkel coalescence
time constant in general agreement with the measured coalescence time constant. This indicates that by knowing the
surface tension of an unknown liquid one can determine the Viscosity from a measurement of the coalescence half
time. This work will continue with more COMSOL numerical calculations and parametric analysis with the new
version of the software to test other more inclusive analytical models from the literature.
