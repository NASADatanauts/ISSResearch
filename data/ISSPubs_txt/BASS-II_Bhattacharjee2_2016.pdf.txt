Abstract
The three regimes of opposed—ﬂow ﬂame spread — radiative, thermal, and kinetic regimes — are well known.
For thermally thin fuels, the spread rate is independent of opposing ﬂow velocity in the thermal regime.
It decreases with an increase in the ﬂow velocity in the kinetic regime, leading to blow off extinction. In
the radiative regime which occurs mostly in a buoyancy—free environment of microgravity, the spread rate
decreases with a decrease in ﬂow velocity leading to radiative extinction unless the oxygen level is very high.
In a recent experiment aboard the International Space Station, thin sheets of PMMA were ignited in a ﬂow
tunnel with the opposing ﬂow varying over a wide range. All three regimes of ﬂame spread were captured
in a single set of experiments for the ﬁrst time. Instantaneous spread rates were obtained from digital Video
processing and compared with a computational model in all three regimes along with the evolution of ﬂame
shapes. Spread rates in the radiative and thermal regimes are also compared with existing theories of ﬂame
spread in the thermal and the radiative regime producing remarkable qualitative agreement.
