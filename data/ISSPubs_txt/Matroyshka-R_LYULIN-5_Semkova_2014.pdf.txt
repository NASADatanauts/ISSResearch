ABSTRACT
Since June 2007 the Liulin-S charged particle telescope, located in the spherical tissue-equivalent phantom of the MATROSHKA-R
project onboard the International Space Station (ISS), has been making measurements of the local energetic particle radiation
environment. From 27 December 2011 to 09 March 2013 measurements were conducted in and outside the phantom located in
the MIMI module of the ISS. In this paper Liulin-S dose rates, due to galactic cosmic rays and South Atlantic Anomaly trapped
protons, measured during that period are presented. Particularly, dose rates and particle ﬂuxes for the radiation characteristics in
the phantom during solar energetic particle (SEP) events occurring in March and May 2012 are discussed. Liulin-S SEP observations
are compared with other ISS data, GOES proton ﬂuxes as well as with solar energetic particle measurements obtained onboard the Mir
space station during previous solar cycles.
