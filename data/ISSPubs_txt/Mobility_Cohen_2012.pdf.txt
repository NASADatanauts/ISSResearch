Abstract. The currently approved Objective Clinical measure of standing balance in astronauts after space ﬂight is the Sensory
Organization Test battery of computerized dynamic posturography. N0 tests of walking balance are currently approved for
standard Clinical testing of astronauts. This study determined the sensitivity and speciﬁcity of standing and walking balance
tests for astronauts before and after long-duration space ﬂight. Astronauts were tested on an Obstacle avoidance test known as
the Functional Mobility Test (FMT) and on the Sensory Organization Test using sway-referenced support surface motion with
eyes Closed (SOT 5) before and siX months after (n = 15) space ﬂight on the International Space Station. They were tested two
to seven days after landing. Scores on SOT tests decreased and scores on FMT increased signiﬁcantly from pre- to post-ﬂight.
In other words, post-ﬂight scores were worse than pre-ﬂight scores. SOT and FMT scores were not signiﬁcantly related. ROC
analyses indicated supra—clinical cut-points for SOT 5 and for FMT. The standard Clinical cut-point for SOT 5 had low sensitivity
to post-ﬂight astronauts. Higher cut-points increased sensitivity to post-ﬂight astronauts but decreased speciﬁcity to pre-ﬂight
astronauts. Using an FMT cut-point that was moderately highly sensitive and highly speciﬁc plus SOT 5 at the standard Clinical
cut-point was no more sensitive than SOT 5, alone. FMT plus SOT 5 at higher cut-points was more speciﬁc and more sensitive.
The total correctly classiﬁed was highest for FMT, alone, and for FMT plus SOT 5 at the highest cut-point. These ﬁndings indicate
that standard Clinical comparisons are not useful for identifying problems. Testing both standing and walking balance will be
more likely to identify balance deﬁcits.
