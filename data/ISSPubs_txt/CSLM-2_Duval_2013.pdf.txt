Abstract
The microgravity environment on the Shuttle and the International Space Station (ISS) provides the ideal condition
to perform experiments on Coarsening in Solid-Liquid Mixtures (CSLM) as deleterious effects such as particle
sedimentation and buoyancy-induced convection are suppressed. For an ideal system such as Lead-Tin in Which all
the thermophysical properties are known, the initial condition in microgravity of randomly dispersed particles
With local clustering of solid Tin in eutectic liquid Lead-Tin matrix, permitted kinetic studies of competitive particle
growth for a range of volume fractions. Veriﬁcation that the quenching phase of the experiment had negligible effect
of the spatial distribution of particles is shown through the computational solution of the dynamical equations of
motion, thus insuring quench-ﬁee effects from the coarsened microstructure measurements. The low volume
fraction experiments conducted on the Shuttle showed agreement With transient Ostwald ripening theory, and the
steady-state requirement of LSW theory was not achieved. More recent experiments conducted on ISS With higher
volume fractions have achieved steady-state condition and show that the kinetics follows the classical diffusion
limited particle coarsening prediction and the measured 3D particle size distribution becomes broader as predicted
from theory.
Introduction
The late stage of ﬁrst-order phase transformation can result in a polydisperse two—phase mixtures composed of a
dispersed second phase in a matrix Whose evolution is driven by surface energy in a diffusional process known as
Ostwald ripening 0r coarsening. For a binary alloy system such as Lead-Tin (Pb-Sn) With ﬁnite volume fractions of
Tin, coarsening is driven by capillary-induced concentration gradients Which depend on local curvature of spherical
particles in the slightly supersaturated matrix. This process can also drive interparticle diffusional interaction
between the particles in the matrix depending on the volume fraction. The system is relaxed toward equilibrium by
minimizing its energy given by the dependence of its chemical potential on curvature [1, 2]. Minimization of energy
in the system occurs through reduction of interfacial area While concomitantly increasing its length scale. The
dynamics occur through competitive particle growth, by Which the population dynamics evolve through the
dissolution of particles smaller than the average particle size and growth of particle larger than the average size
through the matrix.
The theory of coarsening has been described by Lifshitz, Slyozov [3] and Wagner [4] (LSW) for an ideal system in
Which the particles are inﬁnitely separated, n0 diffusional interaction, Which serves as the limit of zero volume
fraction. Practical applications of alloy systems require ﬁnite volume fractions, thus the LSW limit serves as basis
by Which coarsening theories for ﬁnite volume fractions should converge. Hence performing an experiment by
Which LSW theory can be tested is quintessential. LSW theory predicts that for the limit of zero volume fraction
particles grow With time as the cube root of the average radius, and the particle size distribution becomes
independent of time or self—siniilar at steady-state. However ﬁnding a system Which satisﬁes all the constraints of
LSW theory is prohibitive for ground-based laboratory condition due to effects of particle sedimentation and
buoyancy-induced convection.
The purpose of the experiments on Shuttle and ISS is to permit testing of LSW coarsening theory, by elimination of
particle sedimentation and buoyancy-induced convection through the microgravity condition, and to investigate
effect of ﬁnite volume fractions 0n coarsening. The measurement of coarsening rate on volume fraction Will permit

"
"2","comparison between various coarsening theories [5 —18]. However the coarsening function that describes the volume
fraction dependence on the rate constant differs among the different theories. These experiments Will help to
differentiate predictions from coarsening theories based on statistical mechanics [7—13], effective medium or mean
ﬁeld, [14, 15] and numerical simulation [16—18]. The Lead—Tin system is ideal for such a study because the
thermophysical parameters have been measured [19], this permits accurate prediction of the LSW rate constant
Which is dependent on thermophysical properties only.

unit (SPU), the electronics control unit (ECU), and the space acceleration measurement system (SAMS); (b)
hardware overview of the sample chamber in the SPU.

The ﬂight hardware by Which the microgravity experiments were performed is shown in Figure 1 as installed in the
Microgravity Science Glovebox (MSG) in the U.S. Laboratory module on 188. The hardware in Fig. 1a from left to
right consists of the sample processing unit (SPU), an electronics control unit (ECU), and the Space Acceleration
Measurement System (SAMS) for measuring the local microgravity acceleration. The ECU controls the experiment;
the SPU (Fig. 1b) contains the sample holder Which houses the heating unit (63.48 mm diameter and 17 mm thick)
and the samples for processing, a water reservoir at ambient temperature T = 25 0C, a pressurized air cylinder to
drive quenching, and a vacuum connector used to pump the system to a vacuum level of 0.2 Torr for temperature
uniformity in the SPU. The heating system consists of two disc resistance heaters and one ring heater to insure
uniform heating With four resistance temperature devices (RTD) installed mid—way between the discs 17.4 mm from
the center at an angle 0f 900 to measure temperature of the samples. Quenching is achieved by forced ﬂow through
the spray nozzle (Fig. 1b) driven by air pressure for a duration of 20 sec. The SPU heats material samples up to
185°C in less than 9.5 min, holds the temperature for a predetermined time at 185 i 0.1 0C ranging from 0.25 to 48
hrs (coarsening phase), and then quenches the samples to nearly room temperature in approximately 1 minute. The
SPU sample holder contains four Lead—Tin samples of 12 mm diameter and 6 mm thickness for various volume
fractions of Tin.

In order to produce uniform initial particle size distribution, an acceptable heating sequence to reach the coarsening
temperature of 185 0C has been determined from ground—based experiments as shown in Figure 2a. The melting of
the sample from 30 0C to the thermal arrest slightly above 183 0C in less than 210 see is necessary in order to avoid
rearrangement of the particle distribution or signiﬁcant grain growth. The thermal arrest spans a duration of 180 sec
followed by the post—melt equilibration period in Which the temperature rises to 185 0C. In order to avoid dissolution
of smaller particles, it is necessary to minimize temperature overshoot from the temperature change from the thermal
arrest (183 0C) to the coarsening operating temperature (185 OC). As temperature isothermality is necessary for the
experiment, a temperature gradient less than 1°K/cni is required in order to avoid signiﬁcant convection Which
would lead to an inhomogeneous distribution of particles Within the sample. These engineering requirements are
programmed in the ECU through proportional integral derivative (PID) control of the SPU, coupled With robust
design of the heating system to minimize temperature gradient, yield the required temperature isothermality for
successful coarsening experiments. The response of RTD2,3,4 t0 the control RTD1 shows that PID controlled to a
fairly tight tolerance (i 0.2 0C) to approach isothermal conditions.

Figure 2. Heating and Quenching proﬁles for ground-based and microgravity condition showing: (a) heating
sequence to reach coarsening temperature, (b) quenching for ground-based condition, and (c) quenching in
microgravity.
The effect of quenching is to cause formation of a eutectic solid. This solid is nucleated heterogeneously 0n the
existing solid Tin particles in the liquid; thus, there is very little undercooling below the eutectic temperature. An
important parameter that needs to be controlled during the quenching process is the rate of cooling. The cooling rate
determines the average spacing of the eutectic solid which forms during the solidiﬁcation process. A coarse spacing
makes it difﬁcult to locate the interface between the particle and the eutectic. Thus, stereological measurements to
determine particle size become difﬁcult to perform. From ground-based experiments, it was determined that after the
quench is engaged the temperature should drop from 184.9 0C to 120 0C in approximately 6 sec and from 120 0C to
30 0C in approximately 50 see. It was also estimated that a temperature gradient less than 100 OC/cm is required to
ensure that particle motion due to a temperature gradient at the solid-liquid interface will not be of concern.
The cooling curves from the SPU shown in Fig. 2b,c represent an acceptable approximation to the cooling
requirements, as the microstructure from these cooling curves permitted stereological measurements without major
difﬁculty. It was later determined from a demonstration ﬂight experiment that even slow quench can yield
reasonable microstructure, thus the cooling rate can be relaxed. For quenching, RTDl,2,3,4 show response to the
cooling boundary condition. Note since the quench is induced by forced jet ﬂow for 20 see, results from
microgravity and ground-based are not signiﬁcantly different over the time scale of 50 sec for which the temperature
has dropped to 50 0C from the start. However, the ﬂight SPU shows a much longer transient to reach 30 0C in
comparison to ground-based condition due to the reduction of buoyancy-induced convection 0n Shuttle/ISS.
An issue of concern during quench is the effect of large cooling rate on particles in the liquid matrix over the short
time interval prior to solidiﬁcation. A transient model based on two-dimensional dynamical equations of motion was
solved to determine the magnitude of induced velocity as well as particle displacement relative to the average size.
The particles in the liquid matrix is approximated as tracer particles, thus the model is most applicable to the low
volume fraction range of the experiment. This model implies that the density ﬁeld is approximated by an equation of
state p(T)=p(Ta)[l-BAT]; ﬂ is the coefﬁcient of thermal expansion ([3 = 2.14X10'5 / 0K), Ta is the coarsening
temperature taken as 186 0C for initial condition, and AT is the driving temperature difference between the sample
and the cooling boundary. The sudden cooling introduces a discontinuity of the dynamical equilibrium phase and
gives rise to density gradients that are coupled to the temperature ﬁeld. As a result of coupling of the density ﬁeld to
the body force, a buoyancy ﬂow is generated [20]. The coupled set of incompressible Boussinesq equations
(continuity, NaVier-Stokes, temperature, and Lagrangian particle motion) are solved using ﬁnite-difference
techniques with a ﬂux corrected transport algorithm for the nonlinear advective terms of the temperature ﬁeld [20].
From scaling analysis, it has been shown [21] for an analogous heating problem, that the parametric space for the
characteristic velocity magnitude can be given as a function of four parameters,
||V||= ||V|| (Ra, Ar, Pr, f) (1)
where Ra = ngOBqT”Ds4/kv0t, Ar = DS/L, Pr = V/Ot, f = qsr”/qT” ; qT”= qsl”+qsr”+qtb”

"
"4","In the above parameters, go is the standard gravitational acceleration and n is a ratio Which varies depending on the
gravitational level (n=l Earth, n= 10'6 Shuttle/ISS), qT” is the total heat loss at the sample boundary of a disk With
subscripts sl, sr, tb, indicating sides left, right and peripheral; DS and L are sample diameter and thickness, k thermal
conductivity, v the kinematic Viscosity, and 0t the thermal diffusivity in Which (k = 4.09X101 W/m OK , v = 2.48X10'7
1112/8, OL = 1.033X10'5 1112/8). The thermophysical properties needed to estimate the parameters are known for Lead-
Tin [22]. For a nominal heat ﬂux condition estimated at qsr” = 3.49 X103 W/ m2, it is assumed that there is equivalent
heat loss on all surface boundaries of the cylindrical sample qT”= 3qsr”. This implies that the heat ﬂux ratio (l) which
represents the cooling rate is constant, the Prandtl number (Pr) and aspect ratio (Ar) are also constants (f = 0.33,
Ar = 2, Pr = 0.024). It can be shown that scaling leads to “V“ ~ Ra. This scaling laW was veriﬁed through numerical
simulation shown in Figure 3. The Figure shows that depending on the Rayleigh number, convective level intensity,
the ﬂow ﬁeld can be either conductive 0r convective. The reference points, evaluated for asymptotic values at t = 10
sec, shown in Fig. 3 for 10'6gO correspond to Ra = 4.34X10'4 in Which “V“ = 4.85X10'11 m/s, Tmm = 440.3 0K, Tmax =
442.2 0K Whereas at l-gO Ra = 4.34X102, “V“ = 4.85X10'5 m/s and Tmm = 440.3 0K, Tmax = 442.2 0K. In the
conductive region, the linearity of the scaling laW is veriﬁed, “V“ = UO Ra, for Ra S 4.34X103 Where UO = 1.12X10'7
In/s. Since U0 is determined from regression, it has the same units as “V“. Note that the cooling minimum and
maximum temperatures (Tmm, Tmax) in the sample are equivalent for microgravity and ground-based conditions in
agreement With the trends in the cooling curves in Fig. 2b,c. At t = 1 sec Tmm = 456.2 0K and Tmax = 457.9 0K nearly
reach the eutectic temperature with “V“ = 1.88X10'11 m/s for microgravity Which increases by a factor of 106 for lg.
The corresponding particle displacement (Hill), for microgravity and ground-based are respectively ||r|| = 4X10""4 pm
and HI“ = 400 pm. The microgravity particle displacement is much smaller than the average particle size for a typical
range of 10 - 70 pm; this implies that quenching does not affect spatial distribution of particles on ISS/Shuttle.

An important parameter based on the characteristic velocity “V“ Which characterizes the ratio of mass transport by
convection in relation to diffusion is the diffusional Peclet number [23] deﬁned as Fe = “V“ <R> / D , in Which <R>
is the average particle radius and D the diffusion coefﬁcient. For small Peclet number, Pe << 1, mass transport is
dominated by diffusion Which is the required condition for diffusive-coarsening. Figure 3 shows that for
microgravity condition Pe <<l verifying that coarsening occurs by diffusion in microgravity. For the diffusive
regime, there is a linear relationship between Fe and Ra given by
Pe = UO <R> Ra / D (2)

[22]. The above analysis shows that the restriction imposed on heating and quenching resulted in diffusion limited
particle coarsening for microgravity experiments.
Results and Discussion
The microgravity environment is ideal for the testing of LSW theory, since the experiments have to be performed
using ﬁnite volume fractions as an approximation to the zero volume fraction limit of the theory. For lOW volume

"
"5","fractions, as illustrated in Figure 4, under Earth’s gravity sedimentation cause the solid particles to sediment to one
side of the specimen (Fig. 4a). In contrast the ﬁnding in microgravity (Shuttle/ISS) (Fig. 4b) shows that
sedimentation and buoyancy-induced convection effects can be eliminated, thus equi-dispersed particle distribution
can be obtained to allow kinetic studies. Given the ideal initial condition, we contrast the lOW volume fraction results
(CSLM-l, Shuttle) 10 % [24, 25] (Fig. 4c) and the ﬁndings at higher volume fraction 50% [26] (CSLM-Z, ISS) (Fig.
4d). In brief, the lOW volume fraction experiment show that the particles as they coarsen increase in size With
coarsening time While the number of particles decrease; and there is no particle contact as postulated in LSW theory
(Fig. 40). However for higher volume fractions (Fig. 4d) particles are interconnected and deViate from predictions of
mean ﬁeld coarsening theory [14-17] but shows agreement With grain growth theory [26].

The ﬁndings for the lOW volume fraction 10% illustrate the classical description of LSW theory, i.e., the system
approaches a steady-state 0r self—similar regime in Which the particle size distribution (PSD), When scaled by the
average particle size [24, 25], is time invariant (t = 0.6 hr and t = 24 hr) and is independent of both the initial PSD
(t = 0.6 hr) and the parameter of the system (KLSW), for the limit of a vanishing particle volume fraction and in the
limit t—>oo Where t is time. The initial (t = 0) distribution of particles upon melting results in equi-dispersed second
phase domains Which gives rise to spherical particles at t = 0.6 hr. The kinetics of LSW is dependent on the average
particle radius, <R> and Kst by the temporal law,
<R>3<t) = <R>3<0) + mm (3)
Where the LSW rate constant is given by Kst. The uniqueness of the microgravity experiment is the employment of
a system that satisfy all the assumptions employed by theory and in Which the thermophysical properties needed to
determine Kst (= 1.1 pm3/s) are measured [19] independent of a coarsening experiment. The rate constant is given
by, Kst = 8 TOTD/9ML(Cs - CL) With ML the slope of the liquidus curve, and CS and CL the compositions of the
solid and liquid at a planar solid-liquid interface, TO the coarsening temperature, T the capillary length, and D the

"6","diffusion coefﬁcient. The low volume fraction experiment show that, despite the steady-state assumption of LSW
was not realized in this experiment, the temporal growth law kinetics is in agreement with Eq. (1) [24, 25]. The
evolution of the spatial correlation function [25] as time increases indicated the presence of transient Ostwald
ripening [16, 17] or coarsening. Closure t0 the above ﬁndings can be obtained by performing microgravity
experiments in the low volume fraction range in which steady-state is obtained.
The steady-state temporal laws were conﬁrmed for the 30% volume fraction for combined experiments performed
on the Shuttle (CSLM-l) and 188 (CSLM-2) shown in Figure 5 [27]. The experiments showed that the coarsening
rate on Shuttle and 188 are identical, even though g-jitter 0n Shuttle is lower than 188 [22]. There was no
enhancement of coarsening kinetics due to g-jitter which has been shown using mean ﬁeld analysis [28]. Analysis of
g-jitter effect, using the spectrum from SAMS, 0n Stokes particle sedimentation [22] showed that g-jitter can cause
sedimentation 0f the large particles which places a maximum bound of 48 hrs for experiments performed on 188.
This ﬁnding also indicated that experiments can be done on 188 with volume fraction less than 30% to test LSW
theory, since g-jitter was of concern for the low volume fraction coarsening experiments on 188.

For practical applications with higher volume fractions, there have been several theories [5-18] that remove the
restrictive assumption of small volume fraction of the coarsening phase. These theories predict that the cube of the
rate constant (K) and shape of the scaled PSD become a function of the volume fraction. In the limit t—>oo, the
exponent of the temporal law is unaltered. The scaled PSD’s are predicted to be broader and more symmetric than
those given by LSW (Fig. 6b). The rate constant is predicted to vary with volume fraction (CD) as
K((D) = Kst f((D) (4)
where f((D) is the volume fraction dependence of the rate constant and is system independent such that when (D = 0,
K = Kst(F1g. 6a).
For systems with ﬁnite volume fractions of the coarsening phase, the zero volume fraction assumption of LSW in
which there is no particle interaction needs to be modiﬁed to account for diffusional interaction. The diffusional
interactions are included in the theory through a microscopic description of the coarsening process which depends
on interparticle separation distance [23]. This description is based on point source/sink approximation to represent
emission 0r adsorption of solute from shrinking or growing particles as input into the Laplacian concentration ﬁeld.
The coupling of the solutal ﬁeld, for a population of spherical particles, with the restriction placed on mass
conservation (rate of change of volume fraction is zero) and the Gibbs-Thcmpscn boundary condition for mass
balance at the particle-niatrix interface yield a multipcle expansion equation that can be used to predict growth rate.
However, the properties of importance for experiments are statistically averaged quantities. The statistical average
quantities obtained from averaging the microscopic equations fall into three different approaches which includes,
effective medium or mean ﬁeld [14,15,18], statistical mechanics [7-12], and direct numerical simulation [16-18], are
shown in Fig. 6a.
The effects of interparticle interactions, in the low volume fraction limit, can be described from ﬁrst-principles by
using the ﬁrst term in a multipcle expansion for the diffusion ﬁeld in the matrix [23]. This approach, for the
monopole expansion, allows the account of diffusional interactions under the assumption that the volume fraction of
the coarsening phase is less than approximately 0.1. The numerical simulations are illustrated in Fig. 6a for the

"
"7","predictions of Beenaker [8], Enomoto, Kawasaki, and Tokuyama (EKT) [7] and Yao, Elder, Guo and Grant (Yao)
[18]). Aikawa and Voorhees (AV) [16] have extended the monopole approach to volume fraction of 0.3 by adding
dipolar terms to the description of the diffusion ﬁeld. Relative to the monopole (M) approximation, the addition of a
dipolar (M+D) term in Fig. 6a for AV (present M and M+D) is to increase the coarsening rate in comparison EKT.
The effective medium theories of Brailsford and Wynblatt (BW) [14] and Marsh and Glicksman (MR) [15] yield the
largest coarsening rates as a function of (D and can be extended to the higher volume fraction region; With the
exceptions of Marder (MA) [9] Which predicts the largest coarsening rates for (D < 0.05. The statistical mechanical
theories of Marqusee and Ross (MR) [10], and Tokuyama, Kawasaki, and Enomoto (TK) [12] predict lower rate
constants. The AK predictions fall mid-range between the statistical mechanical theories of (MR, TK) and effective
medium theories (BW, MR) for (D > 0.05, for (D = 0.05 AV agrees With BW, and for (D < 0.05 AV converges to the
values of MR and TK. Though the various coarsening theories differ in their prediction of rate constants, there is
agreement on the effect of volume fraction on particle size distribution shown in Fig. 6b, the theory of Enomoto,
Tokuyama and Kawasaki [13] shows that the steady-state particle size distribution becomes broader and more
symmetric than LSW.
In relation to steady-state coarsening experiments in microgravity (ISS), the measured normalized coarsening rate
constant ratio (K/KLSW) for (D = 0.3 is approximately a factor of two times the ratio (K/Kst)AV of AV prediction;
the measured value is also higher than predicted by mean ﬁeld and statistical mechanical theories. However, the
microstructure for the 30% volume fraction also shows particle contacts and non-spherical morphology Which is
outside the theoretical approximations employed in coarsening theories. The particle spatial correlations, given the
presence of localized particle distortions due to diffusional interactions With neighboring particles, also did not agree
With the AV theory at 30%. The particle size distribution at 30% is slightly Wider than theory. For the lowest volume
fractions 15% and 20%, the coarsening rate constant and particle size distribution are closer to theory. This appears
to show that as the volume fraction decreases better agreement With coarsening theory can be obtained. It remains
to address this missing-gap by performing microgravity experiments in the low volume fraction region (D S 0.1 for
steady-state condition.

Concluding Remarks
The microgravity environment (Shuttle/ISS) facilitates the performance of coarsening experiments through
elimination of sedimentation and buoyancy-induced convection effects. Analysis of the quenching phase, through
computational solution of a transient two-dimensional model of the dynamical equations of motion, show that the
Peclet number is much less than one and the particle displacement is much less than the average particle size. This
implies that coarsening was diffusion limited and the spatial distribution of particles on ISS/Shuttle were not

showed clear evidence of transient coarsening. The experiments performed on 188 (CSLM-2) for (D Z 0.15 achieved

steady-state condition; there was no evidence of transient coarsening. The coarsening rate for the 30% volume

fraction is higher than predicted by theory with a particle size distribution which is slightly wider than theory.

Particle spatial correlations are not that predicted by theory which is in agreement with the observation that even in

microgravity the particles are interconnected at 30% volume fraction. However, for the lower volume fraction of

15% the particle size distribution and rate constant are close to theory. The low volume fraction region (D S 0.1 is

promising for differentiation between various coarsening theories and presents a challenge for the attainment of

steady-state condition in microgravity experiments.
