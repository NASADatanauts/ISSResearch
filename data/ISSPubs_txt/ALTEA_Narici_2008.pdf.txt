Abstract. Interactions between ionizing radiation in space and brain functions,
and the related risk assessments, are among the major concerns When
programming long permanence in space, especially When outside the protective
shield of the Earth’s magnetosphere. The light ﬂashes (LF) observed by
astronauts in space, mostly When dark adapted, are an example of these
interactions; investigations in space and 011 the ground showed that these
effects can originate With the action of ionizing radiation in the eye. Recent
ﬁndings from ALTEA, an interdisciplinary and multiapproach program devoted
to the study of different aspects of the radiation—brain functions interaction, are
presented in this paper. These include: (i) study of radiation passing through the
astronauts’ eyes in the International Space Station (~ 20 ions min_l, excluding
H and fast and very slow He), measured in conjunction With reporting of
the perception of LF; (ii) preliminary electrophysiological evidence of these
events in astronauts and in patients during heavy ion therapy; and (iii)
in vitro results showing the radiation driven activation of rhodopsin at the start
of the phototransduction cascade in the process of Vision. These results are in
agreement With our previous work on mice. A brief but complete summary of
the earlier works is also reported to permit a discussion of the results.

1. Introduction
The next tWO—three decades Will see man again on the M0011 and for the ﬁrst time 011 Mars.
These voyages Will bring humans outside the protection of the Earth’s magnetic shield and
atmosphere for a long time. Ionizing radiation Which is mostly absent on the ground and
moderate in space stations (MIR and the International Space Station (188)), may be above
unacceptable risk levels, and is one of the major concerns for the realization of such long-term
space travels (Cucinotta et a] 2005).

Risks due to ionizing radiation traveling through biological tissue have been studied
(Durante 2002) and increase With the increasing dose (dose: energy deposited per unit of mass).
The deﬁnition of these risk assessments is under continuous evolution due to the speciﬁcity of
the different possible damages and t0 the relations between effects and the ionization energy
deposits in tissue (linear energy transfer (LET)) 0f the heavy ions.

Radiation may also have transient effects on brain functions. This is shown, for example,
by the ﬂashes of light perceived by astronauts in space, mostly While dark adapted, in the
absence of real light—technically phosphenes, hereinafter light ﬂashes or LF (Fuglesang 2007,
Sannita et a] 2006). Many experiments, as Will be described later, linked these phenomena
to the energy delivered to portions of the Visual system by cosmic ionizing radiation. More
generally, the delivery of an instantaneous amount of energy in a speciﬁc location of the brain
or eyes may have a non-physiological inﬂuence on the working of the structures that are hit. This
inﬂuence may cause unintended functioning of our senses 0r, worst, of our reactions or cognitive
assessments. Several experiments suggest this kind of inﬂuence. For example, electrical pulses
directly on the brain cortex are perceived by the blind as spots of light (Dobelle et a] 1974);
magnetic pulses on the Visual cortex may lead to the transient inability to detect an otherwise

detectable stimulus (Amassian et a] 1989). The interaction mechanism in these cases is likely
to be different from the one between radiation and the Visual system, however, this evidence
shows that sensory pathways may be inﬂuenced by non-physiological energy deliveries.

Furthermore the LF phenomenon can be seen as an alarm system, signaling an activation
of some otherwise hidden process which may constitute a risk. To deal with this issue it is
necessary to study all the processes that may lead to a particle-triggered LF. Finally, ionizing
radiation may inﬂuence sensory pathways, other than Visual, as is also supported, for example,
by olfactory sensations in coincidence with particle hits (Gauger et a] 1986).

This paper will focus on the understanding of the LF perceptions in space. The aim is to
characterize this effect both in space and in the supporting experiments on the ground. The
questions related to the different possible mechanisms of interactions behind this effect will be
discussed.

Following a short historical background, the results of the several experiments in space and
on the ground performed in the 1970s and 1990s, will be summarized. Our latest measurements
on the 188 will then be described together with the measurements on the ground performed
within the framework of the ALTEA program. Discrepancies and concurrencies will be
underlined with the aim of proposing strategies for bringing new information about this issue.
2. Historical background
A long time before any report from astronauts of anomalous phosphene perceptions in orbit,
Tobias (1952) wrote ‘It is conceivable that very densely ionizing tracks would produce small
ﬂash-like light sensations’. One year after Gagarin’s ﬂight D’Arcy and Porter (1962) reported
the ﬁrst measurement on the ground of Visual sensations caused by cosmic muonsl.

It was Edwin Aldrin, on his return from the Moon, who ﬁrst reported the perception of
unexpected ﬂashes of light (LF), while there was no real light (Pinsky et a] 1974). Since then
most astronauts and cosmonauts have conﬁrmed and detailed these perceptions.

The recognition of the scientiﬁc problem was immediate; the light ﬂashes experienced
by the astronauts provided an increased impetus for radiobiological experimentation by direct
exposure to heavy ions in space.

This evidence triggered a number of dedicated observations in space in the following
missions, ranging from the mere report of the timing and number of LF perceived to the
concurrent measurement of the radiation ﬂux through the astronauts/cosmonauts’ heads.

The awareness of the problem also started a long series of ground-controlled experiments
in accelerators, where subj ects aligned their eyes or brain on the beam line, and described their
perceptions evoked by the passage of the ions.

The results of all these measurements immediately pointed to an interaction of ionizing
cosmic radiation and some part of the Visual system, primarily the retina, as a cause of the
phenomenon. No other targets (brain and optic nerve) seemed to produce evidence, but these
were less studied. The end of the space-race in the 1970s corresponded also to a halt in this
research.

This topic only returned to the Space Agencies’ agendas with our SilEye experiments
on the MIR station in the 1990s. These works conﬁrmed and reﬁned what had already been
described in the previous investigations.

1 These ﬁndings were conﬁrmed 2 years after Apollo 11 (Charman and Rowlands 1971); however, Tobias
et al (1971) could not ﬁnd similar effects.

Recently, at the end of the 1990s, we proposed the ALTEA program, aimed at providing
a broader coverage of this issue. The rationale being that these interaction effects may go well
beyond the clearly perceived LF and could constitute a new kind of risk for longer space voyages
in less protected environments. The strategy being to perform objective measures in space
(trying to avoid relying only on subj ective reports), while designing new controlled experiments
(in vitro, on animals and on humans) on the ground, to study the possible processes linked to
these interactions.

2.]. Measurement in Space in the 19705

After the ﬁrst LF reports, scientists programmed measurements in space, asking astronauts in
the following Apollo missions to devote time for systematic observations of the phenomenon. To
link LF perceptions to some speciﬁc ion traveling through the eyes, a new detector was designed
and deployed (The Apollo Light Flash Moving Emulsion Detector or ALFMED, Pinsky et a]
(1974), Osborne et a] (1975)).

Following the lunar missions, measurements were performed on the Skylab (1974), and
during the Apollo-Soyuz Test Project (ASTP) in 1975.

The Apollo results are mostly summarized into three points: (i) almost everybody perceived
LF (with a single exception: the Command Module pilot of Apollo 16); (ii) the rate was quite
high (an average of about 14 in 1 h); and (iii) there was an impressive difference between the rate
of LF perception during translunar coast (TLC) and during transearth coast (TEC), the former
being about more than 60% higher than the latter. Astronauts also reported that the LF during
TEC were much less brilliant.

The ALFMED detector provided the ﬁrst identiﬁcation of ion-candidates as the cause
of LF perception. Analysis of the data showed two candidates heaVier than oxygen (Osborne
et a] 1975). A later analysis (Fazio et a] 1970) proposed Cherenkov radiation in the Vitreous
as the cause of the LF phenomena, showing a consistency between observed LF rate with the
estimated ﬂux rate. A direct excitation of the retina was considered possible with relativistic
Z 2 2 radiation.

Skylab and ASTP experiments were the ﬁrst to report LF perceptions in low Earth orbit
(LEO).

Skylab experiments were performed in two sessions, separated by a week, by the same
astronaut during the last manned Skylab mission (Skylab 4) in early 1974 (Pinsky et a] 1975).
The sessions lasted 70 and 55 min. During both sessions the Skylab passed through the South
Atlantic Anomaly (SSA), the portion of the low altitude Earth’s inner trapped radiation belt.
The results of these observations showed a dependency of LF perception rate on the radiation
ﬂux, as expected, and a signiﬁcant increase (10—20 times) in the LF rate when passing over
the SSA.

Experiments during the ASTP were performed jointly by the Apollo Commander and
by the Apollo Command Module Pilot. Both were dark—adapted using a light-tight mask for
about 10min. The astronauts perceived a total of 82 LF in 90min for an average rate of
0.46 LF min_l. During the SSA passage the astronauts perceived a total of 4 LF. The results
conﬁrmed the correlation of the LF rate with the modulation of the radiation ﬂux during the
orbit and proposed a LET lower threshold for LP generation of about 5 keV ,LLIIl_1 (Budinger
et a] 1975). The absence of rate increase in the SSA, in contrast with the Skylab ﬁndings,

was explained with considerations about the lower orbit and higher shielding of the ASTP
(see table 1).
2.2. Measurements in accelerators
Several experiments in particle accelerators were performed concurrently with the space
investigations. The experimenters received a minimal quantity of ionizing radiation in their eyes
and psychophysiological responses were recorded. These works were published from 1970 to
1978. The many parameters used could be grouped into two families: beam parameters and
target parameters.

Beam parameters were mostly Z (including neutrons), ﬂuence, length of the burst, energy.
Target parameters deﬁne the speciﬁc physiological target and the direction and versus of the
beam bursts, with reference to the target. Of this multidimensional space only limited regions
have been explored, so that describing a complete picture from these results is quite a difﬁcult
task. Giving a complete account of all these works is not within the scope of this paper. A
schematic summary is given in table 2.

With reference to the table, the particles explored have been ,LL, 7?, He, C, N and neutrons.
The beams were directed almost always towards the eye. Almost all were able to cause LF
sensations in some conﬁguration of the parameters. Only non-energetic neutrons (3 MeV) and
very energetic 77 (1.5 GeV 0‘1) failed to produce LF at the chosen set of the parameters. In
two cases the beams passed through the Visual cortex (N at 266 MeV 11‘1 and cosmic ,LL) and
in both cases there was no LF perception. Detection thresholds were searched for in a few
measurements: with ,u and 77 at least 150—300 particles in each burst were needed for LF
perception. This appears to be in contrast with cosmic ,u where detection (in darkness) was

reported even for a single particle, with a 25% efﬁciency (D’Arcy and Porter 1962, Charman
and Rowlands 1971). As mentioned (see footnote 1), these rather surprising ﬁndings (if this
were true we should often experience LF 011 the ground) could not be conﬁrmed later by
Tobias et al (1971). The two heaVier ions (N and C) were used in single—few particle mode: N
(240 MeV n‘l, lateral incidence) 15 per burst, 40% efﬁciency; N (531 MeV n”, 250 incidence),
single, 10% efﬁciency; C (470 and 595 MeV n”, 600 incidence), 1—2 per burst, 10—67%
efﬁciency.

A possible classiﬁcation of the output of these experiments, beside perceptions and rate
of LF, concerns the LF shape. As illustrated in ﬁgure 1, LF appeared to astronauts (and to
subjects during ground experiments) in many shapes. They were either dot-like (single or many)
and strikes, or diffuse. Also color is sometime reported, and often motion. During the many
controlled experiments there had been an effort to link LF Characteristics with the possible
processes that might have generated them. As an example, the diffuse LF, sometimes with dark
center, appeared to be related to Cherenkov radiation (McNulty et al 1975). However, again, the
very partial coverage of the parameter space did not allow for ﬁnal associations. The absence of
LF moving vertically (see also Fuglesang et al 2006) appears to be one of the very few common
Characteristics of all the reports about LF.

2.3. Measurements on board MIR (SilEye)
Starting from the mid-1990s we designed SilEye, a new space experiment to clarify some of
the LF issues. From 1995 to 1999, we carried out the longest LF observation campaign on
board the MIR station (AVdeeV et al 2002). A total of 29 sessions, involving six cosmonauts
and spanning almost 26h (with 233 LF perceptions), were performed. The overall rate was
about 9 LF h‘1 (average time between LF: 6.6 min). Two different SilEye apparata were used.
They included an active particle telescope which was able to measure particles, identifying Z,
trajectory and energy released (Bidoli et al 2001). The telescope was positioned either in front
of the eye (SilEyel) or 1atera11yto the right eye (SilEye2), permitting the detection of particles
passing through the eye. SilEyel was a prototype and pioneer experiment (Bidoli et al 2000).
SilEye2 detected a total of about 116 X 103 H, 858 nuclei (Z 2 2) and 4434 showers passing
through eyes in the 814 min of observation. In the same time window 116 LF were perceived
(AVdeeV et al 2002). Using as reference the signal recorded from a pushbutton, pressed when
a LF was perceived, 8 ions have been reported as candidates for the generation of the LF (see
table 3). The ratio of the number of candidates to the number of perceived LF was shown to be
in good agreement with the estimate for the relative geometrical acceptance of the eyes and the
detector (6—7%). An analysis of the LET distribution showed that the probability of generating
a LF increased with increasing LET, suggesting a LET higher than 10 keV ,LLIn_1 was needed to
generate a LF (AVdeeV et al 2002), in agreement with previous measurements (Tobias 1973).
The probability for an ion (Z 2 2) traveling through the eye to generate a LF was found to be
%1%, while the same probability for a proton with E < 200 MeV was found to be about 750
times smaller. About 90% of the ﬂashes were described as lines or lines with gaps. The rate of
LP in the SAA was about twice as large as the rate outside the SAA. There was no apparent long-
term dynamics with the permanence in space, as conﬁrmed by a later survey among astronauts
(Fuglesang et al 2006). It should be mentioned that two astronauts out of the ten involved in the
experiment did not report any LF. A further analysis of the data collected in the SAA (Casolino
et al 2003) proposed that high proton ﬂuxes have a role in LF generation suggesting knock on
processes on C N 0, whereas outside the SAA high charge and energy (HZE) particles have
the leading role. As discussed in the last section, the contribution of high LET stopping protons
should also be taken into account.

3. The ALTEA program

ALTEA is a full-soale interdisciplinary program aimed at investigating the LF phenomena, and
more generally the interaction between cosmic radiation and brain functions (Narici et a] 2003,
2004)

The ALTEA program is searching for answers to several questions:

1) What kind of functional effects on the brain can be elicited by radiation? Which of these
effects may have associated risks?
2) What kind of radiation (Z, energy) is more likely to produce such effects?
3) What is the radiation environment the astronauts are experiencing in the 188?
4) What portion of this radiation is produced by interactions in the spacecraft hull?
5) What are the speciﬁc interactions causing thesefunctional effects?
6) Can we quantify the functional risk due to these effects in LEO?
7) What are the best countermeasures that should be taken to minimize these risks?
8) Can we extrapolate these ﬁndings to outer space (Moon, Mars), and with what level of
conﬁdence?
In order to provide answers to these questions new space hardware has been developed and a
series of supporting ground experiments have been designed.

The ALTEA space particle detector is a natural development of our previous SilEye
detectors, with a much larger solid angle coverage for the particles passing through the head. To
obtain obj ective information about the LF perception we included in the system the possibility
of recording electrophysiological signals Via a high deﬁnition electroencephalographer (EEG).
To monitor the status of the Visual system in microgravity a Visual stimulator was also added.
Due to the end of the operational life of MIR, the natural site of the ALTEA space project has
been the 188.

Finally a series of experiments based on measurements in particle accelerators was
designed with the aim of supporting the space measurements and providing detailed information
on the possible mechanisms of the radiation—brain functions interaction.

The program in the current form will not give exhaustive answers to all the questions
mentioned above; however, it is providing valuable information concerning all the raised
problems and for some of the topics it is also providing ﬁnal answers.

3.]. The questionnaire

The ALTEA program started with the collection of the subjective experiences of the many
astronauts who have ﬂown since the Apollo missions. These represent important information
for the understanding of the phenomena related to these perceptions.

A 29 item questionnaire was prepared and distributed to 98 astronauts who have ﬂown
in different missions (Fuglesang et a] 2006). Of them 58 responded and of these 47 reported
experiencing LP (in agreement with the percentage found during the SilEye experiment on
MIR). The answers to this survey show clearly the broadness of the characteristics of these
effects: from the astronauts who never observed LE to the ones whose sleep was disturbed by
them (%20%), or to those who reported LF Visible even in bright light (for 1—2 cases). LF have
been described with many shapes, several different colors, steady or moving. Interestingly, no

"11","10 IOP Institute of Physics (DDEUTSCHE PHYSIKALISCHE GESELLSCHAFT
astronaut has ever reported an apparent vertical motion (motion has been reported only in the
horizontal plane, in the two directions or a combination of them). If we associate the ‘diffuse’
LF shapes with the Cherenkov effect, we could infer that about 5—10% of the LF might be due
to this process.

3.2. Alteino

Alteino/SilEye3 was the ﬁrst experimental achievement of the program providing the ﬁrst
measurement with full Z discrimination of the radiation environment in the ISS (Pirs module,
in the Russian Segment, Casolino et a] (2002), Narici et a] (2004)).

Alteino featured a l6-channel EEG and an active particle detector, an upgrade of the SilEye
ones, placed nearby the astronaut so as to measure the radiation ﬂux, however, without the
possibility of retrieving timed particle data through the eyes. Six LF sessions were performed
in April—May 2002, in the Pirs module of the 188 (see table 1). The total observation time
was 7 h 41 min and the LF rate ranged from 3 to 9 LF h‘l. Alteino permitted us to master EEG
measurements in space.

3.3. ALTEA Space hardware

The ALTEA hardware has been operating in the ISS—USLab since August 2006. It features
six identical silicon particle telescopes assembled on a helmet-shaped holder (silicon detector
system, SDS). Each telescope is made with six silicon planes—each composed of two
8 x 8 cm2 and 380 ,um thick wafers—striped alternately in the x- and y-directions, in order
to be able to reconstruct the trajectory of the particle. A 32 electrode EEG cap, including
three ﬂoating electrodes for retinogram measurements, and high resolution electronics allow
for electrophysiological readings. A Visual stimulator is used to deliver standard stimuli.
Electrophysiological responses to these stimuli (evoked potentials) are measured to test the
status of the Visual system. A three-button pushbutton is used to signal the LF perception. At
the highest sensitivity, the SDS is able to detect particles from He to relativistic Mo, and
protons between 25 and 200 MeV (Zaconte et a] 2008).

3.4. The DOS] and CNSM modalities

ALTEA space is mounted on an express rack in the USLab and can be utilized in two modalities:
dosimetry (DOST) and central nervous system monitoring (CNSM).

In the D081 unmanned modality, the six detectors on the helmet (silicon detector system,
SDS), tilted ﬂat on the rack as shown in ﬁgure 2, continuously measure the environmental
radiation. Data are downlinked in real time to the ground, to the User Home Base in the
Department of Physics of the University of Rome ‘Tor Vergata’. Real time and off line software
provides tools to discriminate the kinds of particles, calculate trajectories and energy of
the particles, constructing spectra of the measured radiation. ALTEA operated in DOSI mode
almost continuously from August 2006 to July 2007.2

The manned experimental modality (CNSM) is speciﬁcally aimed at the study of the
interaction between particle passages and brain electrophysiological dynamics. The detector is
extended normal to the rack. The astronaut wears the EEG cap, inserts the disposable pregelled
2 A recent agreement between NASA and the Italian Space Agency will permit the use of ALTEA for monitoring
radiation during operations from the beginning of 2009.

astronaut’s head. For about 25 min he/she is presented With a standard set of Visual stimuli, then
the astronaut relaxes; after about 5—10 min of dark adaptation the observing session starts: each
perception of a LF is signaled With the pushbutton. The observing session lasts about one hour.

Figure 4. A spectrum of the radiation environment of the ISS showing
the nuclear discrimination capability of the ALTEA detector. Only particles
releasing an almost constant energy (< 10% difference between the two outer
planes) are counted. The spectrum refers to about six months acquisition with
10 MIP threshold.

Total measurement time is about 1.5 h: one orbit. Seven sessions with three astronauts have
been performed. The last one was lengthened to allow a measurement with a full passage in the
SAA (the other six did not pass over the SAA during the observing time).

3.5. ALTEA Space preliminary results
Data analysis for the ALTEA-space measurements is still in progress and will be the topic of
focused papers in preparation.

Here preliminary results are reported. These may have already provided insights on the LF
phenomena and, in general, on the interaction of ionizing radiation with brain functions. These
ﬁndings will be discussed in the panorama of the previous results.

When operating in the D081 mode ALTEA allowed for a quite detailed View of the
radiation environment in the USLab. In ﬁgure 4, we show the spectrum from six months
acquisition, with a threshold of 10 MIP (MIP: minimum ionizing particle = 109 keV/ 3 80 ,um
of silicon). In this conﬁguration, ions from B to Fe are discriminated. Lower thresholds permit
lighter ions to be discriminated.

The seven sessions of CNSM measurements produced 20 LF perceived in about 7h
of observing time (see tables 1 and 4), less than expected considering the previous LEO
measurements (see table 1). More than half of these LF were perceived in a single session.
Only the last session passed over the SAA. The astronaut paid particular attention during the
transit; however, he reported to have seen no LF during that period.

Using the discriminating and tracking capability of ALTEA, during the CNSM sessions the
ionizing radiation passing through the eyes and the brain of the astronauts has been measured
and characterized for the ﬁrst time. Analysis is still in progress, however, preliminary results
from the ﬁrst session show a measured rate of about 2.8 ions rnin‘1 in the eyes.

We evaluated in different ways the total rate of radiation hitting the astronauts’ eyes
in the energy range detected by ALTEA, taking into account the geometrical factors of
the SDS (1190 cm2 sr, Zaconte et a] 2008) and 0f the eyes, and found consistently m2 x
101 ions min‘1 through the eyes (the ratio of eye acceptance to SDS acceptance is $6.3) and
4—5 x 102 ions 1nin‘1 in the brain. These ﬁgures are lower limits: instrument dead times and
multiple traces have not yet been considered. Furthermore the detectors are not triggered by
most protons and high energy He, however, these low LET ions (less than 1.5 keV Mm_1) should
not have an important role in LF generation (AVdeeV et a] 2002, Budinger et a] 1975, Tobias
etall973)

When the analysis is completed we Will also be able to estimate the charge of each of the
measured ions. Work is in progress to determine the energy discrimination ability of the device
both at low and high input energies. Our goal is to calculate the dose per diem in the eye/brain
0f the astronauts. Preliminary results permit the radiation in the eyes to be detailed as shown in
table 5.

These values are in principle applicable to any 188 orbits (excluding SAA), and to any
astronaut.

To compare these ﬁndings With estimations in the literature some evaluation of the
amount of shielding of the USLab, Where CNSM and D081 are performed, is needed. From
comparison of our measured relative ion abundances inside the 188 to ion spectra outside the
ISS (Simpson 1983) propagated through the Station hull, this shielding can be estimated to be
about 10—15 g cm‘z.

We compared our measured eyes rate (with Z 2 6) with previously published estimations.
For example, Fazio et a] (1970) reported an estimate of 0.5—1.0ion cm‘2 min‘1 for heavy
ions (Z 2 6) reaching the eyes, in the Apollo command module, which was a factor of 3—5
less shielded than the USLab (see table 1). Our ﬁgure of 1.5 ions min‘1 should be compared
with 2.3—4.5 ion min‘1 (considering both eyes) estimated in the reported paper. Considering the
higher shielding of the USLab and that our measurement have been performed in LEO, while
the mentioned estimates were for a lunar ﬂight outside the magnetosphere, our ﬁgure appears
compatible with the previous evaluations.

This measured rate of ions in the eye in ALTEA—CNSM produced an averaged rate of
85 x 10—2 LF min‘1 (20 in about 7h of observation). Assuming that each of the ions in the
eyes could cause a LF, we can calculate an efﬁciency of $2 x 10—3. This ﬁgure is an upper
limit, due to the non-considered dead-times, multiple tracks and other possible brain targets
(that may produce Visual sensations, such as in the optic nerve, or the Visual cortex). One way to
interpret this data is to assume a simple geometrical efﬁciency, leading to a sensitive surface of
about 7 mm2, which might be consistent with some portion of the retina. This assumption would
be compatible with an interaction model requiring speciﬁc areas within the retina as targets.

The observed LF rate is lower than expected. SilEye ﬁndings, for example, would suggest
about three times more LF. There is also a lower efﬁciency in ALTEA in the production of
LP by particles impinging the astronauts’ eyes in comparison to SilEye (a factor of 5 less).
This may suggest that the observed lower LF rate may not be due to the possibly higher
USLab shielding (and consequently lower ﬁuence), indicating interindividual variability and
physiological parameters as conceivable reasons for this discrepancy.

The electrophysiological measurements in space (ALTEA—CNSM) are providing the ﬁrst
links between radiation and its effects on electrophysiology. Geometrical considerations show
that only about 1 particle will be measured for every ~ 6—7 passing through the eye, so we
expect to be able to identify $3 ion candidates for the 20 LF perceived. We have been ﬁrst
analyzing the electroretinograms (ERG), looking for features in the ERG traces linked to the
particle passages in the eye. Results from the ﬁrst session indicate one, possibly two candidates.
Both ions are light (Z g 3—4) and appear to produce an ERG signal which in morphology is
similar to the one measured after light stimulation. Analysis is still in progress and results will
be published soon.

The electrophysiological response from one of these candidates is shown in ﬁgure 5 (ERG
from right eye, following one particle (estimated Z w 3) which is hitting the same eye; see top
right inset for the traj ectory). In ﬁgure 5 we can follow the time behaVior of the retinal response
from the arrival of the ion (t = 0 ms) to the signal from the pushbutton (t = 880 ms), and the
possible underlying actiVities. The processes we are most interested in are probably in the ﬁrst
102 ms. We know that the ion will release some energy in the eye, and that sometime in the
following 500 ms the astronaut perceives the LF, prepares to move his ﬁnger, and ﬁnally presses
the PB. The electrophysiological retinal response at $102 ms, similar in morphology to known
responses to light, suggests that the energy released is routed into a quasi-physiological path
producing a response compatible with the known light-induced responses.

Note that our preliminary ﬁndings (backed by the previous results) seem to indicate that
the most probable ions for generating LF are light ions (see table 3).

We are also analyzing signals from the Visual cortex (Visual evoked potentials, VEP)
searching for correlations with ions in the retina, in the optic nerves and in the cortex,
regardless of the perception of LF. The ﬁnal analysis goal will be to investigate the brain

electrophysiological dynamics following ionizing radiation impacts in all brain regions (not
only in the Visual areas), regardless of the generation of LF. The rationale is the assumption
that: (i) there might be direct effects on the retinal/brain electrophysiology that do not trigger
cognitive events such as perception; and (ii) regions of the brain other than Visual areas may
be affected as well by incident radiation. In both cases electrophysiological signals will provide
useful information for understanding the biophysical interaction at the start of these processes.
Analysis in this sense is in progress.
4. The ground-based experiments in the ALTEA program
Several ground experiments provide a controlled environment for these investigations.
The appropriate ﬁrst step would be to repeat the 1970’s experiment using objective EEG
recordings. However this would likely encounter vetoes from ethical committees.
Therefore we designed and performed experiments on animal models, patients and in vitro.
We set up an animal model using mice, irradiated with very short bursts of heavy ions
while concurrently acquiring electrophysiological data from the retina and from the cortex
(ALTEA—MICE). We also measured EEG and ERG of those patients undergoing tumor
heavy-ion therapy at GSI (Darmstadt, FRG) who reported perceiving LF during the therapy
(ALTEA-HIT). Finally, we started in vitro investigations of the behavior of rhodopsin, at the
start of the phototransduction cascade in the process of Vision, when hit by heavy ions (ALTEA-
biophys).

This proj ect proposes an animal in vivo model for the study of the origin of the radiation-indueed
phosphenes (Sannita et al 2004). It is aimed at studying the electrophysiological dynamics of
mice, while the eye or the cortex is irradiated with very short bursts of heavy ions. T0 assume
that the mouse Visual system interprets each burst as a single-energy delivery, the burst length
is kept below 2 ms.

A setup has been designed and built to hold the mouse and provide capability for remote
controlled alignment to the beam (ﬁgure 6). The same setup permits the animal to be stimulated
with light (with a white LED), to monitor the experiment with an infrared Video camera, to
precisely position the electrodes (cortical and retinal), to control the temperature of the animal,
and to quickly Change the animal maintaining the alignment set. The whole measurement is
remotely controlled from the beam line control room.

Several preliminary measurements have been performed at GSI (Darmstadt, FRG) and at
Brookhaven National Laboratories (AGS, NSRL).

In a pilot experiment (Sannita et al 2006), we irradiated the retina of anesthetized wild-
type mice with short bursts of carbon ions, below the Cherenkov threshold. 12C ions evoked
electrophysiological responses in the mouse retina and Visual cortex comparable to those
following light stimuli. Responses to 12C ions were obtained with burst lengths of g 2ms,
containing @103 ions, 250 MeV 11—1 (LET = 14 keV ,um‘l), in about 50% 0f the mice tested.

electrophysiological responses comparable to that of light from a particle passing through the

We did not detect damage in the retinal architecture, staining intensity and distribution of
various antigens of retinal samples studied by immunocytochemistry.
In one mouse, we recorded Clear online retinal responses (see ﬁgure 7, lower inset), and
we studied the response dependence with the number N of ions in the burst. We observed a

to zero with N > 3000 (ﬁgure 7). When 1700 < N < 2700 (between 15 and 45 min) 98.6% of

particles within the same burst needed to generate the response, as well as to (ii) the low

probability that a single particle (or a small number of them) would produce a response, for
cross-sectional reasons. However, when these data are seen in the panorama offered by the
other ground and space results, only this second explanation survives. In this case, the threshold
would be seen as the result of a m 10—3 total efﬁciency value, in agreement with what was found
for single-particle generation in the CNSM measurements (see above). The drop-off observed
at higher rates might be due to a not yet identiﬁed saturation process.

One of the online responses is compared (ﬁgure 8) to the astronaut retinal response in
ﬁgure 5. The morphology similarity is evident, and the slight latency delay (about 20 ms) is
compatible with differences in latencies between human and mice responses.

The wide inter—animal response variation found in the mice experiment might suggest that
we had scarce control on some unidentiﬁed parameter, or/and that we may be triggering more
than one process leading to electrophysiological responses.

4.2. ALTEA—HIT

The intensity modulated heavy ion tumor therapy at GSI exploits the characteristic depth-dose
proﬁles of heavy ions in matter to irradiate tumors with minimal effects on the surrounding
tissues (Kraft 2000). The beam intensity is of the order of 107—8 ions s‘1 and a complex control
system permits the dose of each irradiated voxel to be speciﬁed. Several patients undergoing
heavy ion therapy reported the perception of LF during the irradiation (Schardt and Kramer
2002). Since then we started a collaboration with the GSI/Heidelberg medical and physics teams
to measure EEG of the patients while they were being irradiated. Therapy is distributed over 20
sessions, in consecutive days. We usually tested a few patients each therapy run, for at least four
sessions. The project started in August 2004, we have measured a total of 15 patients in four
therapy runs between 2005 and 2007.

Patients’ heads are anchored on a bed Via a thermoplastic mask manufactured for each
patient. The therapy masks of those patients who reported haVing perceived LF during therapy

were equipped with electrodes to measure EEG and ERG during therapy. A pushbutton was
used by the patients to signal the LF perception.

Data analysis is in progress. The main goal will be to assess the precise location(s) of the
beam when the LF is generated. This will permit eye/brain areas where LF might be generated
to be shown.

Preliminary ﬁndings show a large signal (same polarity of the ‘b’ retinal wave, about 102 ms
long and about 300—1000 ms prior to the pushbutton signal) measured on the cortical/retinal
electrodes (ﬁgure 9, red trace) when the beam is irradiating locations on the boundary of the
tumor, possibly with a marginal interest of the posterior region of the eye (the exact location of
the beam is still under analysis). Each single site is irradiated for a few milliseconds; however, it
is quite conceivable that many adj acent sites could generate LF, and in this case we would have a
multiple trigger, summing up to a long ‘partiele stimulus’ which might modify the morphology
of the response, probably increasing its length.

4.3. ALTEA—biophys
Rhodopsin is at the start of the phototransduction cascade in the process of Vision. It is one
of the best molecular transducers for converting a Visible photon into an electric signal. It is
therefore the ﬁrst candidate as the target for the radiation—Visual system interaction. We have
been working to study the possibility that rhodopsin can also be activated by irradiation with
12C nuclei.

Intact rod outer segments (ROS) containing rhodopsin were isolated from bovine retina.
Suspended ROS were irradiated with 12C (200 MeV n‘l, well below the Cherenkov threshold)
at GSI (Darmstadt, Germany). Spectrophotometric measurements investigated the activation
(bleaching) of the rhodopsin. The functionality of the ROS after irradiation was checked by
regenerating the rhodopsin in vitro. With these measurements we were able to show that
radiation can induce bleaching, and that rhodopsin can be subsequently effectively regenerated.

Data analysis and work on the understanding of the interaction mechanism are in progress.
5. Discussion and conclusions
The LP phenomenon demonstrates that radiation may modify perceptions: light is seen where
there is no light. This effect would be potentially critical in space under conditions requiring
reliable Visual processing. If LF disturb normal occurrence of sleep (Fuglesang et a] 2006) this
might also constitute a problem for long permanence in space. Similar interactions may also
concern other sensory and possibly cognitive brain areas, producing different kinds of risks.
Furthermore the underlying, and yet to be described, interactions producing LF may also be
evidence of other processes constituting a hazard for prolonged missions. Discovering and
describing such interactions is therefore of paramount importance when attempting to deﬁne
the risk parameters.

The investigation of the radiation environment during the ALTEA—CNSM sessions is
providing the ﬁrst measurement of the amount of radiation traveling through the eye (2 x
101 ions min_l) and through the brain (4—5 x 102 ions min_l) of an astronaut in LEO. Further
data analysis should permit the contributions of the different ions to be separated and the dose
per diem in the eye/brain of the astronauts to be calculated.

An upper limit on the ‘LF generation efﬁcienoy’ (m2 x 10‘3) was calculated from the
measured rate. This limit, if interpreted as a geometrical efﬁciency, would lead to a sensitive
surface about the size of a portion of the retina (m7 mm2). This interpretation would require an
interaction model where only speciﬁc locations in the retina can participate in LF generation.
It will therefore be important to verify whether the model(s) that will be proposed from the
ALTEA—biophys proj eot will be compatible with interactions of this kind.

The threshold of about 103 particles in mice (ﬁgure 7, Sannita et a] 2007) can be Viewed
also as a detection efﬁciency in agreement with what was found in the CNSM measurements.

The higher efﬁciency (up to m 10%) claimed by a few experimenters in the 1970s ground-
based experiments (see, for example, McNulty et a] 1972) may be due to the beam alignments
over the human retina which were more precise in those measurements in accelerators, as

compared with a collimated beam over the whole mouse eye, or with the tracking spatial
resolution of the ALTEA system.

The large variability of the subjective LF reports of the astronauts seems unlikely to be
entirely explained by differences in radiation kind and ﬂuences (due to altitude, latitude and
vessel shielding), providing strong hints toward the coexistence of many routes to LF generation,
and for considering physiological (and psychological) parameters as important co-causes. This
should be also taken into account when interpreting the low LF rate measured in ALTEA, which
might be only partly explained by the better shielding of the ISS—USLab and by the possible
non complete dark adaption as suggested by one of the astronauts.

The electrophysiological measurements in space and on the ground are providing insights
into the mechanisms correlated to particle passages and LF perceptions. Astronauts, mice
(ﬁgures 7 and 8) and patients undergoing heavy ion therapy (ﬁgure 9) seem to produce similar
responses even in different environmental and experimental conditions.

A most important question, mainly addressed by the ALTEA—biophysics project, is
whether an ion entering the eye tissue can couple directly with the sensorial pathway with
a yet to be discovered mechanism, or produces a photon which acts as a transducer to turn
the ion energy into a compatible form for the Visual sensors in the retina, or, more likely, if
both processes are possible. Our rhodopsin measurements demonstrate that rhodopsin can be
bleached by radiation; work is in progress to describe compatible process(es) producing this
bleaching.

There have been a large number of discussions about which particles are responsible for
LF. The available particle candidates detected in space in coincidence with LF perceptions
seem to indicate ions comprised between Z = 3 and Z w 8, with three exceptions (in the MIR
experiments, one Cr candidate, and in the Apollo experiments two candidates with Z > 8). This
of course also reﬂects the relative abundance of the ions (0 is about 102 times more abundant
than Fe). On the ground much lighter particles such as He nuclei and ,u and 77 have also been
shown to be able to elicit LF.

The discussion about the proton contribution is still open. Unfortunately, only one passage
on the SAA (where the radiation environment is mostly low energy protons) has been measured
in the ALTEA—CNSM sessions, however, in that passage no LF was reported. The striking
difference between the ﬁndings in the Skylab and the ASTP measurements in the SAA (table 1)
can be accounted for by a combination of different altitude and different shielding. Better
shielding in the ISS—USLab might also be one explanation for the missing LP in the SAA.

The most accredited model for LF induced by protons refers to nuclear interaction in or
near the retina (inelastic nuclear collision with C, H, O, Rothwell et a] 1976, Casolino et a]
2003), Cherenkov not being possible due to the low energy. Interestingly, in ground experiments
no clear direct evidence of this effect was looked for. Helium nuclei have been shown to elicit
LF (Budinger et a] 1972), light ions (with LET x 3—6 keV Mm_1) appear to be among the
candidates for ALTEA—CNSM LF. Direct investigation on the ground of proton induced LF
might add useful information about the underlying processes.

The large amount of ALTEA data under analysis, and the new measurements foreseen to
start again at the beginning of next year, will provide further answers to the questions mentioned
in section 3.

The working strategy will be to infer from the electrophysiological measurements possible
generating processes and to investigate them in detail with in vitro measurements. This, and the

study of the radiation environment in the 188, would allow a risk assessment to be provided and
countermeasure strategies to be proposed.

Finally these data Will be extrapolated for interplanetary voyages using simulations
providing risk parameters for the next return to the Moon and for the ﬂight to Mars.
