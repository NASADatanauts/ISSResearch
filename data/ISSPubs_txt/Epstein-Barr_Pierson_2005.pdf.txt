Abstract
Patterns of Epstein—Barr Virus (EBV) reactivation in 32 astronauts and 18 healthy age—matched control subjects were character—

ized by quantifying EBV shedding. Saliva samples were collected from astronauts before, during, and after 10 space shuttle missions
of 5—14 days duration. At one time point or another, EBV was detected in saliva from each of the astronauts. Of 1398 saliva spec—
imens from 32 astronauts, polymerase Chain reaction analysis showed that 314 (23%) were positive for EBV DNA. Examination by
ﬂight phase showed that 29% of the saliva specimens collected from 28 astronauts before ﬂight were positive for EBV DNA, as were
16% of those collected from 25 astronauts during ﬂight and 16% of those collected after ﬂight from 23 astronauts. The mean number
of EBV copies from samples taken during the ﬂights was 417per mL, signiﬁcantly greater ([9 < .05) than the number of Viral copies
from the preﬂight (40) and postﬂight (44) phases. In contrast, the control subjects shed EBV DNA with a frequency of 3.7% and
mean number of EBV copies of 40 per mL of saliva. Ten days before ﬂight and on landing day, titers of antibody to EBV Viral capsid
antigen were signiﬁcantly (p < .05) greater than baseline levels. On landing day, urinary levels of cortisol and catecholamines were
greater than their preﬂight values. In a limited study (n : 5), plasma levels of substance P and other neuropeptides were also greater
on landing day. Increases in the number of Viral copies and in the amount of EBV—speciﬁc antibody were consistent with EBV reac—
tivation before, during, and after space ﬂight.
