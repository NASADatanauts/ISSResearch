Knowledge of simulated microgravity (SMG)-induced changes in the pathogenicity
of microorganisms is important for success of long-term spaceflight. In a previous
study using the high aspect ratio vessel bioreactor, we showed that the yeast species
Saccharomyces cerevisiae underwent a significant phenotypic response when grown
in modeled microgravity, which was reflected in the analysis of gene expression
profiles. In this study, we establish that Candida albicans responds to SMG in a
similar fashion, demonstrating that there is a conserved response among yeast to
this environmental stress. We also report that the growth of C. albicans in SMG
results in a morphogenic switch that is consistent with enhanced pathogenicity.
Specifically, we observed an increase in filamentous forms of the organism and
accompanying changes in the expression of two genes associated with the yeast-
hyphal transition. The morphological response may have significant implications
for astronauts’ safety, as the fungal pathogen may become more virulent during
spaceflight.
