ABSTRACT
The spectra of high—energy protons and nuclei accelerated by supernova remnant (SNR) shocks are calculated,
taking into account magnetic ﬁeld ampliﬁcation and Alfvénic drift both upstream and downstream of the shock for
different types of SNRs during their evolution. The maximum energy of accelerated particles may reach 5 X 1018 eV
for Fe ions in Type IIb SNRs. The calculated energy spectrum of cosmic rays after propagation through the Galaxy
is in good agreement With the spectrum measured at the Earth.
