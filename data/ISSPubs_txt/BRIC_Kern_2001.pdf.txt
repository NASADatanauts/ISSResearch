' ABSTRACT
Apical cells of moss protonemata represent a single-celled system that perceives and reacts to light (positive
and negative phototropism) and to gravity (negative gravitropism). Phototropism completely overrides
gravitropism when apical cells are laterally irradiated with relatively high red light intensities, but below a
deﬁned light intensity threshold gravitropism competes with the phototropic reaction. A 16 day-long
exposure to microgravity conditions demonstrated that gravitropism is allowed when protonemata are
laterally illuminated with light intensities below 140 nmol m'zs'l. Protonemata that were grown in darkness in
microgravity expressed an endogenous tendency to grow in arcs so that the overall culture morphology
resembled a clockwise spiral. However this phenomenon only was observed in cultures that had reached a
critical age and/or size. Organelle positioning in dark-grown apical cells was signiﬁcantly altered in
microgravity. Gravisensing most likely involves the sedimentation of starch-ﬁlled amyloplasts in a well-
defmed area of the tip cell. Amyloplasts that at l-g are sedimented were clustered at the apical part of the
sedimentation zone in microgravity. Clustering observed in microgravity or during clino-rotation signiﬁcantly
differs from sedimentation-induced plastid aggregations after inversion of tip cells at l-g.

INTRODUCTION

Apical cells of Ceratodon purpureus protonemata offer the unique opportunity to study gravitropism and
phototropism at the cellular level. Both environmental stimuli, light and gravity, are sensed by these cells and
transformed into gravitropic and phototropic responses. Limited data exist on the interaction between
gravitropism, phototropism and light in moss protonemata. In darkness, Ceratodon protonemata express
strong negative gravitropism (Hartmann et a1. 1983; Walker and Sack, 1990); while in red light protonemal
gravitropism is inhibited and phototropism predominates (Cove et a1. 1978; Hartmann et a1. 1983; Jenkins et
al. 1986; Cove and Knight 1987; Young and Sack 1992; Lamparter et a1. 1996, 1998; Demkiv et a1. 1997;
Kern and Sack, 19993). By analyzing aphototropic mutants, Lamparter et a1. (1996) determined that the red
light repression of gravitropism is phytochrome—mediated and occurs independently of phototropism.

Dark grown apical cells of Ceratodon protonemata display a complex arrangement (zonation) of starch-
ﬁlled amyloplasts throughout the cell (Walker and Sack, 1990). Plastid sedimentation occurs in a sub-apical
zone distal to the nucleus; an event believed to be one of the key elements during gravity perception.
Amyloplast sedimentation is only known to occur in specialized cells which are thought to sense gravity using
amyloplast mass (Sack, 1991; 1997). ,

Phototropism, overall culture morphology, and the arrangement of amy10plasts in microgravity were
examined during the STS-87 spaceﬂight experiment. Contrary to our prediction, amyloplasts were not
oriented randomly throughout the cells in pg, revealing additional information of the nature of the gravi-
sensing apparatus. Furthermore, the orientation of protonemal growth within the Ceratodon culture was not
random. The possible signiﬁcance of several endogenous tendencies revealed in the absence of gravity will be
discussed.

MATERIALS AND METHODS

All experiments used the wild-type 4 strain of Ceratodon purpureus (Hedw.) Brid. This strain was
originally derived from a single spore in 1979 and propagated vegetatively (Hartmann and Weber, 1988).

The microgravity experiments were performed during the STS—87 ﬂight as part of the Collaborative
USA/Ukrainian Experiment (CUE) on the space shuttle Columbia. Brieﬂy,.cultures were housed in Petri Dish
Fixation Units (PDFU) that were enclosed by BRIC/LEDs (Biological Research in Canisters/Light Emitting
Diode). The hardware components are described in detail in Kern et al. (1999). This hardware allowed for
chemical ﬁxation in microgravity, and for growth in darkness or in unilateral red light from LEDs (660 nm,
CMD67-21SRC/TR8, Chicago Miniature Lamp, Hackensack, NJ) at two different irradiances. Identical
hardware was used for ground reference experiments performed with a 48 h delay in the Orbiter Environmental
Simulator (OES) at Kennedy Space Center (KSC). Additional BRIC/LEDs were rotated horizontally at 1 rpm
on customized clinostats. After launch (Nov. 19, 1997), Ceratodon cultures (3 dishes for each treatment)
were incubated in microgravity for 7 d in darkness at ambient temperature (shuttle middeck; 23-26°C). Some
dishes were chemically ﬁxed (2% glutaraldehyde, 1% paraformaldehyde, 50 mM PIPES, 5 mM CaClz, pH 7.1;
Sigma) at that timepoint, and other dishes were either incubated in darkness, or they were subsequently
illuminated with 1 nmol rn'zs'l red light for 4, 24, 48 h and 7 d, or at 50 nmol m'zs'1 for 1 d. The cultures were
then chemically ﬁxed in position and recovered after landing at KSC on Dec. 5, 1997.

The tip angles of all apical cells were calculated using an angular scale (Figure 3B) with 0° representing
upward, negatively gravitropic orientation, and 180° representing positive gravitropism. During irradiation
experiments, perfect alignment into the light path (positive phototropism) was expressed as 90°, negative
phototropism as 270°. For cells at 1-g, the line connecting 90° and 270° was horizontal. For microgravity,
this line referenced the path of unilateral light. Data were plotted in circular histograms (not normalized for
sample size).

Light intensity threshold experiments in Figure 4 were described in detail in Kern and Sack (1999a).
Brieﬂy, an experiment setup based on ﬁltered light emitted by a ﬂuorescent bulb (F 40GO; General Electric Co.,
Cleveland, OH) was utilized.

For the analysis of amyloplast arrangement in Figure 8C, a customized software macro (NASA Ames
Research Center, CA) was used in combination with NIH Image software. The number of black pixels was
determined as a percentage of all pixels for 100 sectors. These sectors were arranged in series from the tip of
the cell to the center of the nucleus. Each sector was deﬁned as 1% of the distance between the cell tip and the
nucleus. The mean distance was roughly comparable between different treatments (data not shown).
RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
Gravitropism is repressed in higher irradiance red light

Apical cells of dark-grown Ceratodon protonemata express negative gravitropism (Figure 1A), although
several positively gravitropic mutants have been identiﬁed (Wagner et al. 1997; Lamparter et a1. 1998).
When upright dark-grown protonemata were illuminated with red light at an irradiance of 1.5 nmol m'zs’l,
most cells expressed strong positive phototropism (FigUre 1B). However, a signiﬁcant percentage of apical

Cells display negative phototropism (Figure 1B, arrowheads). The kinetics of positive and negative photo-
tropism were virtually identical (Figure 2; Kern and Sack, 1999a). Initially, fewer than 20% of all protone-
mata were negatively phototmpic (ﬁrst 24 h of irradiation). Over time, as new tip cells emerged, up to 50%
of all cells exhibited negative phototropism suggesting that the polarity of the phototropic response, i.e. the
relative frequencies of positively and negatively oriented tips, was inﬂuenced by the duration of illumination.
The kinetics of phototropism during red light irradiation and that of negative gravitropism in the dark were
largely comparable. However, the onset of gravitropism was slightly slower due to a short lag phase (Figure 2).
Complete reorientation in all cases was reached after 12 to 24 h. The phototropism time course at l—g

(Figure 3A, middle column) and various reorientation experiments with respect to the gravity vector and the
light source (data shOwn in Kern and Sack, 1999a, b) demonstrated that in all cases protonemata became
aligned in the light path either positively or negatively phototropically with no evidence of any gravitropism
(1.0 nmol m'zs‘1 irradiation intensity; Figure 3A, middle column).

When phototropism at l-g was compared to cultures that were incubated in microgravity during
spaceﬂight (Figure 3B) or clino-rotated (randomization of the gravity stimulus), both the kinetics of
phototropism and the mean angles achieved were essentially the same (Figure 3A).

Gravitropism competes with phototropism in low irradiation intensity

The existence of a light intensity threshold in Ceratodon at which residual gravitropism is expressed
during red light treatment has been shown earlier (Kern and Sack, 1999a, b). Brieﬂ¥, at light intensities lower
than ~l40 nmol m‘zs'l, phototropism and gravitropism interact. At 140 nmol m'zs' , no gravitropism could be
found (F igure 4A, upperemost histogram), just as at a ﬂuence rate of 1.5 nmol m’zs'l. Lamparter et al. (1996,
1998) reported that a ﬂuence rate of 6 pmol m'zs‘1 red light repressed gravitropism in Ceratodon protonemata
via phytochrome, but did not test whether this repression was partial or complete. However, since we did not
employ omnilateral light, it can’t be ruled out that some residual gravitropism might persist in red light at

irradiance greater than 140 nmol m'zs‘l. But at or

increased over time (in case of cultures that had been inverted for additional 2d).

Additional experiments in microgravity ruled out any endogenous tendency for cells to bend
preferentially in one direction that might be confused with gravitropism. Cultures grown for 7 d in darkness in
pg were then illuminated with a ﬂuence rate of ~50 nmol In'zs'1 red light for 1 (1 (Figure 5A). The tip angles of
protonemata were equally distributed on both sides of the light path (50% each, Figure 5B) compared to a 9:1
ratio above the horizontal in the l—g control (Figure 5C). Thus, gravitropism clearly operates at l-g in low
irra-diance red light. In the microgravity experiments in space, protonemata were largely aligned with respect
to the light i.e. 70% of all tips were oriented within :t 45° of the light path (Figure 5B).

control results from competition between phototropism and gravitropism. No phototrOpic polarity was found. N = 343.
(Figure from Kern and Sack, 1999a).

These data rule out the hypothesis that low irradiance red light modulates the gravitropic set point angle
in the absence of phototropism, a mechanism that seems to operate in higher plants (Lu et a1. 1996; Hangarter
1997). Instead, in Ceratodon apical cells, the idea that the net tip angle results from an interaction between
gravitropism and red-light phototropism is supported. Thus, the phytochrome-mediated repression of
gravin'opism at or above the ~140 nmol m'zs'1 irradiance threshold is at least partially reduced at lower
irradiances. Moreover, the ﬁnding that cells move closer to the upright position as the irradiance decreases
(data not shown; Kern and Sack, 1999a, b) suggests that gravitropism becomes stronger and/or phototropism
becomes weaker at decreasing irradiances. A red-light dependent irradiance-based pattern of regulation of
gravitropism like that found in Ceratodon protonemata appears not to have been described in higher plants.
For example, red light randomizes the orientation of Arabidopsis hypocotyls, but it has not been determined
whether this represents a partial or complete repression of gravitropism, or whether red light actually changes
the gravitropic set point angle (Hangarter 1997).

Culture morphology in microgravity

One major goal of the STS-87 ﬂight experiment was to determine whether the growth of Ceratodon
protonemata was random in microgravity. Since in darkness at l-g, protonemata strictly orient themselves in
the gravitational ﬁeld by growing straight up (Figure 1A), one prediction for ﬂight was that orientation would

'be random, just as in roots and shoots in space. However, the three cultures grown in the dark for 14 days
displayed clear clockwise spirals in microgravity (Figure 6A). In the three cultures grown in the dark for 7 days
in ﬂight, spirals were not distinct (data not shown). This suggests that cultures need to reach a certain age or
stage of development before the spirals are expressed. In a separate treatment during the STS-87 ﬂight experi-

ment, cells were exposed to high-intensity unilateral red light for 7 days and subsequently cultivated in
darkness for 7 days. After 7 days of irradiation, most cells were oriented towards the light, but some grow
directly away (positive and negative phototropism respectively). After additional 7 days in the dark, new tip
growth initiated resulting in clockwise hooks at each end (Figure 6B). This suggests that 7 days in
microgravity is sufﬁcient to induce clockwise spirals as long as the culture reached a developmental age of at
least 7 days before exposure to microgravity.

As far as we are aware, the STS-87 results represent only the second time that any gravitropic plant cell
or organ grew non-randomly in space (cress roots form arcs related to the seed that produces them). The
presence of coordinated clockwise spiral growth in microgravity suggests that there is an endogenous growth
polarity in Ceratodon that normally is suppressed by gravitropism. A working hypothesis is that the spirals
represent a residual spacing mechanism for controlling colony growth and the distribution of branches under
some conditions and in some mosses. However, further studies including an upcoming ﬂight experiment on
STS-107 (late 2001) are needed to put these unusual ﬁndings in context.

Plastid position

Statoliths are suspected to act as the initial gravity signal susceptor (Sack, 1991). Sedimenting starch-

ﬁlled amyloplasts or in other cases heavy dense barium sulfate crystals (alga Chara, Volkmann et al., 1991) are
believed to trigger a cascade of events that lead to gravitropic curvature.
Ceratodon apical cells possess a unique plastid zonation with four distinct zones (Figure 7A; Walker and Sack,
1990). The tip-most 10 pm, zone 1, contains a group of non-sedimenting plastids followed by a plastid—free
zone (11, 10-20 pm). Zone 111, the sedimentation zone, reaches from the plastid—free zone to the nucleus (~40
pm). Zone IV, the basal zone, includes the rest of the cell between the nucleus and the basal cell wall. The
length of this zone varies from 50-150 pm, largely due to cell growth during the cell cycle.

Negatively gravitropic upright—growing cells demonstrated a complex pattern of plastid sedimentation in
zone III (Sack et al., 1998), with only some plastids that sediment basipetally onto the nucleus (Figure 7A,
arrowhead). When an upright cell was reoriented 90° to the horizontal (Figure 7B), a redistribution of
amyloplasts was initiated. After 0.5 h plastids started to accumulate at the lower side wall in the apical part of
the sedimentation zone. This lateral sedimentation increased over time. Plastid sedimentation preceded the
gravitropic bending reaction that became obvious at around 1.5 h after reorientation. After 4-6 h the upright
negative gravitropic orientation with the normal zonation phenotype was restored (Figure 78, right).

Since amyloplasts sediment along the length of apical cells in upright (Figures 7; 8A, left cell) and inverted
positions (Figure SB), the prediction for microgravity was that thehamyloplasts that normally sediment would
be randomly distributed without a gravity cue. Instead, dark- grown cells for 7 or 14 d in microgravity had
amyloplasts that were concentrated in sub-apical clusters immediately below the plastid-free zone (Figure 8A,
right cell; SB 2nd cell) and thus distributed non-randomly. However, plastid zonation was undisturbed. This
distribution is similar, but not identical to cells that have been rotated on a clinostat or inverted at 1-g (Figure
83, 3rd on 4‘“ cell). Detailed quantiﬁcation of mean plastid area within zones I to 111 from populations of cells
(Figure 8C) demonstrated that plastid area was highest close to the nucleus, a distribution that reﬂects the

plastid area was located immediately behind the plastid-free zone in the apical part of zone III. This analysis
supports the observation that plastids are clustered in the sub-apical region of microgravity-grown apical cells.

It has previously been shown (Schwuchow and Sack, 1994) that sedimentation at l-g is normally
restricted by microtubules, not microﬁlaments. Because microtubules may act as load—bearing framework for
amyloplasts, it is possible that when this load is released in microgravity that microtubules function in
positioning the amyloplasts close to the cell tip. Two hypothetical mechanisms for this are that a g-induced
strain normally controls the degree of tubulin polymerization or that there is a default organelle motility that
is normally counteracted by gravity.

The ﬁnding that amyloplasts in microgravity-grown cells are distributed close to the apex suggests that
endogenous forces act constitutively on these organelles. Gravity can counteract these forces as evidenced by
amyloplast sedimentation in upright cells on the ground. Because microtubules are load-bearing for
amyloplasts at l-g, it is logical that they might also be important for the positioning seen in microgravity.
While more analysis is needed to understand the mechanism, these data support the idea that both intrinsic and
extrinsic forces control the position of dense organelles. These results are also consistent with the hypothesis
that the cytoskeleton evolved, at least in part, to prevent the stratiﬁcation of organelles only by density.
SUMMARY

Our ﬂight experiment on STS-87 allowed us to investigate new phenomena as well as answer questions

that could not have been answered without performing experiments in microgravity. Ground-based
experiments had demonstrated that high irradiance red light sufﬁciently overrides gravitropic curvature.
However, it was unknown if the orientation of protonemata strictly above the horizontal recorded under low
irradiance application (Figure 4B) was due to an interaction of gravitropism with phototrOpism or a modiﬁed
gravitropic reaction (Kern and Sack, 1999a). Microgravity experiments clearly demonstrated that low ﬂuence
rate red light induces phototropism, which is consistent with the hypothesis that in ground-based conditions
gravitropism competes with phototmpism when the irradiance level is <140 nmol m'zs' .
Surprisingly, culture morphology was signiﬁcantly altered when Ceratodon was incubated in the dark in
microgravity in that protonemata grew in clockwise spirals. This contrasts with the prediction that culture
morphology and protonemal orientation would be randomized when cultured in pg. Additionally, it was
documented that cultures must reach a deﬁned age/size in order to express this tendency.

Ceratodon protonemata are well known for their distinct zonation of plastid orientation in the apical cell
(Walker and Sack, 1990; Sack et al., 1998). Since on ground these starch-ﬁlled amyloplasts sediment with
respect to the gravitational ﬁeld, it was predicted that plastids would be distributed randomly in pg. Instead,
plastids accumulated to form sub-apical clusters proximal to the plastid-free zone. This phenomenon most
likely involves components of the cytoskeleton and is not fully understood at this time. A future spaceﬂight
experiment on STS-107 is planned to further investigate spiral formation in microgravity (time-course) and to
analyze amyloplast cluster formation. In this experiment, the application of cytoskeletal inhibitors will allow
