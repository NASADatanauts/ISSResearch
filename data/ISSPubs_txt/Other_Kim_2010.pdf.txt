Abstract
For the evaluation of organ dose and dose equivalent of astronauts on space shuttle and the International Space Station (188) mis—
sions, the CAMERA models of CAM (Computerized Anatomical Male) and CAF (Computerized Anatomical Female) of human tissue
shielding have been implemented and used in radiation transport model calculations at NASA. One of new human geometry models to
meet the “reference person” of International Commission on Radiological Protection (ICRP) is based on detailed Voxel (volumetric and
pixel) phantom models denoted for male and female as MAX (Male Adult VOXel) and FAX (Female Adult VOXel), respectively. We
compared the CAM model predictions of organ doses to those of MAX model, since the MAX model represents the male adult body
with much higher ﬁdelity than the CAM model currently used at NASA. Directional body—shielding mass was evaluated for over 1500
target points of MAX for speciﬁed organs considered to be sensitive to the induction of stochastic effects. Radiation exposures to solar
particle event (SPE), trapped protons, and galactic cosmic ray (GCR) were assessed at the speciﬁc sites in the MAX phantom by coupling
space radiation transport models with the relevant body—shielding mass. The development of multiple—point body—shielding distributions
at each organ made it possible to estimate the mean and variance of organ doses at the speciﬁc organ. For the estimate of doses to the
blood forming organs (BFOs), data on active marrow distributions in adult were used to weight the bone marrow sites over the human
body. The discrete number of target points of MAX organs resulted in a reduced organ dose and dose equivalent compared to the results
of CAM organs especially for SPE, and should be further investigated. Differences of effective doses between the two approaches were
found to be small (<5%) for GCR.
