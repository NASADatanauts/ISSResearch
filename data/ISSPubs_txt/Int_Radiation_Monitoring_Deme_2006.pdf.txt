This paper presents results from dosimetric measurements made aboard the Mir space station and the International Space
Station (ISS) using the Pille portable thermoluminescent dosemeter (TLD) system. This paper includes the dosimetry
mapping and automatic readout (trapped and untrapped components) results from Mir and ISS. The mean dose rate in
2001—2003 was 7 uGy h‘l. Using the hourly measuring period in automatic mode, doses from both galactic (independent of
South Atlantic Anomaly—SAA) and SAA components were determined during Euromir’95 experiment. The mean total dose U
rate was 12.5 uGy h‘l, while the SAA contribution was 6.2 uGy h‘l. A similar measurement was performed on ISS in 2001 C2)
and in 2003. Both the manual and automatic measurements show a signiﬁcant decrease in dose rate in 2001 in comparison to C57
1995—1997 due to the change in solar activity. For determination of the high linear energy transfer contribution from the :81).
