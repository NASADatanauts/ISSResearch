We present a multistep procedure yielding large (diameter > 2 [4111) monodisperse, ﬂuorescently labeled eore—shell
poly(rnethyl methacrylate) (PMMA) latex particles Via dispersion polymerization. The particles’ physical properties
were controlled by adjusting two reaction parameters, the initiator and Chain transfer agent concentrations, which
inﬂuence the molecular weight of the PMMA. Under certain conditions, particles with the requisite properties for
fabricating colloidal Clusters were synthesized. The resulting Clusters represent a new type of nonspherieal colloid that
can be dispersed in a density- and refractive index-matching solvent, making them ideal for quantitative studies using
confocal microscopy. To demonstrate the utility of our Clusters, we measured the translational and rotational diffusion
coefﬁcients of a tetrahedral Cluster by tracking the motion of its constituent particles in three-dimensional space. More
broadly, our ﬁndings provide new insights concerning PMMA dispersion polymerization in apolar media.
