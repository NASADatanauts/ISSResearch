Abstract
Background: To counteract microgravity (pG)—ihduced adaptation, European Space Agency (ESA) astronauts on
long—duration missions (LDIVls) to the International Space Station (ISS) perform a daily physical exercise counter—
measure program. Since the ﬁrst ESA crewmember completed an LDIVl in 2006, the ESA countermeasure program
has strived to provide efﬁcient protection against decreases in body mass, muscle strength, bone mass, and aerobic
capacity within the operational constraints ofthe ISS environment and the Changing availability ofon—board exercise
devices. The purpose ofthis paper is to provide a description of ESA’s individualised approach to ih—ﬂight exercise
countermeasures and an up—to—date picture of how exercise is used to counteract physiological Changes resulting
from pG—ihduced adaptation. Changes in the absolute workload for resistive exercise, treadmill running and cycle
ergometry throughout ESA’s eight LDIVls are also presented, and aspects of pre—ﬂight physical preparation and post—
ﬂight reconditioning outlined.
Results: With the introduction ofthe advanced resistive exercise device (ARED) in 2009, the relative contribution of
resistance exercise to total ih—ﬂight exercise increased (33—46 %), whilst treadmill rurmihg (42—33 %) and cycle ergom—
etry (26—20 %) decreased. All eight ESA crewmembers increased their ih—ﬂight absolute workload during their LDIVls
for resistance exercise and treadmill rurmihg (running speed and vertical loading through the harness), while cycle
ergometer workload was unchanged across missions.
Conclusion: Increased or unchanged absolute exercise workloads ih—ﬂight would appear contradictory to typical
post—ﬂight reductions in muscle mass and strength, and cardiovascular capacity following LDIVls. However, increased
absolute ih—ﬂight workloads are not directly linked to Changes in exercise capacity as they likely also reﬂect the
planned, conservative loading early in the mission to allow adaption to 06 exercise, including personal comfort
issues with novel exercise hardware (e.g. the treadmill harness). Inconsistency in hardware and individualised support
concepts across time limit the comparability of results from different crewmembers, and questions regarding the
difference between cycling and running in 06 versus identical exercise here on Earth, and other factors that might
inﬂuence ih—ﬂight exercise performance, still require further investigation.
