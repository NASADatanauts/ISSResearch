Abstract. Ocular counter-rolling (OCR) induced by whole body tilt in roll has been explored after spaceﬂight as an indicator of

the adaptation of the otolith function to microgravity. It has been claimed that the overall pattern of OCR responses during static

body ti1t after spaceﬂight is indicative of a decreased role of the otolith function, but the results of these studies have not been

consistent, mostly due to large variations in the OCR within and across individuals. By contrast with static head tilt, off-Vertical

aXis rotation (OVAR) presents the advantage of generating a sinusoidal modulation of OCR, allowing averaged measurements

over several cycles, thus improving measurement accuracy. Accordingly, OCR and the sense of roll ti1t were evaluated in seven

astronauts before and after spaceﬂight during OVAR at 45°/s in darkness at two angles of tilt (100 and 20°). There was no

signiﬁcant difference in OCR during OVAR immediately after landing compared to preﬂight. However, the amplitude of the

perceived r011ti1tduring OVAR was signiﬁcantly larger immediately postﬂight, and then returned to control values in the following

days. Since the OCR response is predominantly attributed to the shearing force exerted on the utricular macula, the absence of

change in OCR postﬂight suggests that the peripheral otolith organs function normally after short-term spaceﬂight. However,

the increased sense of roll ti1t indicates an adaptation in the central processing of gravitational input, presumably related to a

re-weighting 0f the internal representation of gravitational vertical as a result of adaptation to microgravity.
