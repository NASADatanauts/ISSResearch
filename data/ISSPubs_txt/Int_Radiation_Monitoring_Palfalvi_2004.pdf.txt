The aim of the study was to investigate the contribution of secondary neutrons t0 the total dose inside the International Space
Station (ISS). For this purpose solid-state nuclear track detector (SSNTD) stacks were used. Each stack consisted of three
CR-39 sheets. The ﬁrst and second sheets were separated by a Ti plate, and the second and third sheets sandwiched a Lexan
polycarbonate foil. The neutron and proton responses of each sheet were studied through MC calculations and experimentally,
utilising monoenergetic protons. Seven stacks were exposed in 2001 for 249 days at different locations of the Russian segment
‘Zvezda’. The total storage time before and after the exposure onboard was estimated to be seven months. Another
eight stacks were exposed at the CERF high-energy neutron ﬁeld for calibration purposes.

The CR-39 detectors were evaluated in four steps: after 2, 6, 12 and 20 h etching in 6 N NaOH at 700C (VB : 1.34 um
h‘l). All the individual tracks were investigated and recorded using an image analyser. The stacks provided the averaged
neutron ambient dose equivalent (H*) between 200 keV and 20 MeV, and the values varied from 39 to 73 [18V d_l, depending
on the location. The Lexan detectors were used to detect the dose originating from high-charge and high-energy (HZE)
particles. These results will be published elsewhere.
