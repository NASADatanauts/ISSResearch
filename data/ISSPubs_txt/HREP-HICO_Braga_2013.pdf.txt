1. Introductlon
Coastal zones are important interfaces between land, sea and atmosphere, acting as
a boundary for oceanic Circulation and currents, as well as receiving inputs from the
land. River discharge, Wind energy, tidal mixing and long-shore currents inﬂuence the
distribution of suspended and dissolved matter in coastal zones, varying their con-
centration, size and physical—Chemical composition. The organic component, be it
dissolved or particulate, is also generated and converted Within the coastal system
(by photosynthesis and degradation) and its distribution may vary considerably. The
impact of human activities (e.g. changes in land use, sewage discharge, aquaculture
industry and port activities) on coastal ecosystems further increases their variability.

The Hyperspectral Imager for the Coastal Ocean (HICOTM) is the ﬁrst space-borne
hyperspectral sensor designed speciﬁcally for the coastal ocean and for estuarine,

riverine, lacustrine and other shallow-water areas. The HICOTM acquires images from
different angles in selected areas, at various times of day. Each pixel covers 90 x 90 m,
with 87 nominal spectral Channels in the range of 400—900 nm providing information
on water properties and bottom reﬂectance (see Lucke er al. 2011).
HICOTM images have been proved to be useful for estimating ehlorophyll-a (ehl-a)
(Gitelson er al. 2011), as well as for monitoring suspended sediments in river plumes
(Tuﬁllaro er al. 2010). Most of the related studies focused on very turbid and pro-
ductive waters, applying semi-empirical algorithms optimized for HICOTM spectral
bands. In the present study, the aim is instead to use the HICOTM data for assess-
ing water quality in moderately productive waters. This work concerns an area in the
northern Adriatic Sea deﬁned by Berthon and Zibordi (2004) as a frontal area between
case 1 and case 2 conditions according to the Morel and Prieur (1977) optical water
type classiﬁcation.
Water quality was assessed by (1) deﬁning a two-component bio-optieal model
v parameterised with speciﬁc inherent optical properties for the study area, (2) correct-
§ ing the HICOTM at-sensor radianees for both atmospheric and adjacent effects and
33 (3) adopting a bio-optieal model inversion technique. The study used data collected
g by the Aerosol Robotic Network-Oeean Colour (AERONET-OC) (Holben er al. 1998)
a at the Aequa Alta Oceanographic Tower (AAOT). These data were used both to run
g the atmospheric correction code and to validate HICOTM-derived reﬂectance. Water-
3 quality parameters (e.g. concentrations of Chl-a, suspended particulate matter (SPM)
g and coloured dissolved organic matter (CDOM)) and water reﬂectanees collected
j: during the satellite overpass were also considered for validation purposes.

g 2.1 Study area and in situ measurements
a The northern Adriatic Sea is in the northernmost part of the Mediterranean and is
3 characterized by a shallow depth (averaging 35 m). It receives approximately 20% of
E“ the total Mediterranean river run-off, mainly from the Po (the longest river in Italy),
E and its hydrodynamics are seasonally inﬂuenced by meteorological physical forcing
g (winds and tides). The northern Adriatic is also considered to be one of the most
E productive regions of the generally oligotrophic Mediterranean Sea. The largest phy-
8 toplankton blooms occur in its surface layers in late winter and in summer, they occur
in the western part of the region. According to Hooker er al. (2004), the area alternates
between case 1 and case 2 water types. Case 2 conditions are mainly due to the effects
of local winds, which resuspend bottom sediments, and due to the discharge from the
Po River and other rivers to the north (Adige, Piave, Tagliamento and Isonzo), which
are sources of terrestrial particulate and dissolved matter. The Venice Lagoon and
the Grado—Marano Lagoon lie along the northern Adriatic coastline, and the water
exchange between the lagoons and the sea is governed by tide and contributes to the
input of organic matter in the coastal waters (Ferrarin er al. 2013).
A 7-day cruise was undertaken in the study area (ﬁgure 1) in the second week of May
2012 to gather data for the purpose of calibrating a bio-optieal model and assessing the
HICOTM-derived products, including water reﬂectance and water-quality parameters.
At 18 stations (ﬁgure 1), discrete water samples were collected to measure absorp-
tion and concentration at two different depths (at the surface, by sampling the ﬁrst
integrated meter, and at the Secchi disk depth); then, the samples were ﬁltered imme-
diately in situ and were stored for subsequent laboratory analysis. The concentration

‘53 of chl-a was measured using the trichrornatie method (APHA 1981), the concen-
E tration of SPM was measured with the gravimetric method (Van der Linde 1998)
E and the concentration of CDOM was assumed from the aCDOMOt) at 440 11m (A
L3 indicates the wavelength). The absorption spectra of particles retained on the ﬁl-
d ters, apOt), were obtained using the ﬁlter pad technique (Strombeck and Pierson
E 2001) and were calculated according to Babin er al. (2003). The spectrophotomet-
ﬁ ric determination and processing of the CDOM absorption spectra, aCDOMOt), were
g derived from Kirk (1994). At the same stations where the water was sampled, remote-
;8 sensing reﬂectance (Rrs) values (omitting the wavelength dependence for the sake of
g clarity, apart from a few cases) were measured with a WISP-3 speetroradiometer
8 (Water Insight, Wageningen, The Netherlands; Hommersorn er al. 2012) in the optical
range of 380—800 nm. A HydroScat-6 backscattering sensor (HOBILabs, Tucson, AZ,
USA) was also used to estimate the backscattering coefﬁcient of the particles (bb_p (1))
(Mafﬁone and Dana 1997).
Some of the in Sim data used in this study were provided by the AERONET—OC
AAOT station (Zibordi er al. 2009), located in the northern Adriatic approximately
15 km south-east of the Venice lagoon (12.510 E, 45.310 N); these data enabled us
to identify the atmospheric parameters useful for the atmospheric correction of the
HICOTM image, as well as providing reference water reﬂectance spectra to validate the
HICOTM-derived reﬂectances.
2.2 Bio-optical modelling
The bio-optical model used in this study was based on works by Lee et al. (1998, 1999),
where the RrsOt) above water was a function of the subsurface radiance reﬂectance
subsequently calculated as a function of the absorption a(A) and backscattering [913(k)

coefﬁcients. To express the dependence of a(A) and 191,0») on constituent concentrations
(ehl-a, CDOM and SPM), the spectral absorption coefﬁcient, a(A), was modelled as
a(A) = aW(A) + aCDOM(440) x e—SCDOMXQ—W + [chl—a] x age) (1)
where, aW(A) is the pure-water absorption (Smith and Baker 1981, Pope and Fry 1997),
SCDOM is the slope factor commonly used in modelling the absorption spectra of
CDOM, [Chl-a] is the concentration of Chl-a and a*p(A) is the speciﬁc absorption of the
particles, including phytoplankton and detritus. In this study, SCDOM was established
from each CDOM absorption spectrum measured, and the average slope (0.018) was
used as the model parameter. The speciﬁc absorption for all particles, a*p(A), was
the average value of the Chlorophyll-speeiﬁe particle absorption coefﬁcients. In both
cases, the average values were used because the data sets showed a low range of vari-
ation, with a coefﬁcient of variation below 5% for both the CDOM slope and the
E ehlorophyll-speeiﬁe particle absorption coefﬁcient.

D 2.3 Image processing
A hyperspeetral image was acquired by the HICOTM sensor on 12 May 2012. The
signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of the at-the-sensor radiance in the HICOTM data was
investigated according to Gao (1993): for each sensor Channel, the local standard deVi-
ation (LSD) was calculated for each block of pixels in the scene, identiﬁed using a
moving window technique; the maximum value on the LSD histogram (representing
the mean noise of the image) was then used to calculate the SNR, deﬁned as the ratio
between the mean value signal and the mean noise of the image.

The at-the-sensor radiance was converted into R1,S values above the water surface by
adapting the algorithm presented in Bassani er al. (2010) to the HICOTM image. The
algorithm, called the HICO@CRI (HICOTM atmospherieally corrected reﬂectance
image), is based on the atmospheric correction method presented in Vermote er al.
(1997), using the 68V radiative transfer code (Vermote er al. 1997, Kotehenova
er al. 2008). The HICO@CRI also implements a correction for the adjacency effect
according to Vermote er al. (1997) using the empirical formula

where ,01- is the at-ground reﬂectance of the ith Channel, ,0? is the reﬂectance with the
environmental contribution and e‘T/MV and td(,uv)l- are the direct and diffuse compo-
nents of the atmospheric transmittance along the target-sensor direction, respectively.
These radiative quantities depend on the cosine of the Viewing zenith angle, ,uV =
cos 9V. The direct component is also deﬁned by the total optical thickness, ‘L'. The
< ,0? > is the average of the ,01-8 for the ith Channel, calculated on the whole image to
ensure that the adj aeency effect is removed from each pixel in the image.

The HICO@CRI inputs on aerosol optical thickness at 550 nm and precipitable
water vapour were obtained at the AERONET-OC AAOT station, as retrieved from
the direct sun algorithm at level 2.0 (Eek er al. 1999). The size distribution of the
aerosol was obtained from the diffuse component corresponding to Cloud-screened

v level 1.5 (Smirnov er al. 2000). The aerosol optical thickness at 550 nm (equal to

S 0.25) showed a low aerosol loading at the time of the HICOTM image acquisition,

33 while the Size distribution indicated an aerosol model dominated by ﬁne particles,

g typical situation of the Adriatic Sea, as reported in Melin er al. (2006).

g 3. Results and discussion

E The SNR for the HICOTM data showed an average value of about 80 for all the 87 sen-

ﬁ sor Channels for an albedo value of about 1%. In particular, the analysis showed a

E? decreasing SNR for increasing wavelengths, with an average value of about 100 in the

E, ﬁrst 30 bands from 400 to 570 nm, the minimum value of 40 only being reached at

g bands 74 and 75, at around 825 nm. These results are consistent with the ﬁndings of

:1 Moses er al. (2012).

a The methods used to assess water quality from the HICOTM image were assessed

3 using in Sim data collected at the 9 stations (of the 18) Visited synchronously with the

E“ HICOTM overpass on 12 May 2012 (ﬁgure 1, red dots) and 2 days previously, since

E a 2-day mismatch between in Sim data and acquired image is acceptable for the pur-

g pose of validating water-quality products based on the assumption that environmental

E variables (e.g. wind and river discharge) are fairly stable (Odermatt er al. 2010).

8 Figure 2 shows the convergence of the R1.S values obtained from atmospherically eor-
reeted image data, in Sim speetroradiometric data and forward bio-optieal modelling.
The plot is given for the wavelengths measured by the radiometer at the AERONET-
OC AAOT station (412, 442, 490, 530, 551, 667 and 868 nm), which are common to
the HICOTM data and WISP-3 speetroradiometer (except for the band at 868 nm). The
plotted spectra are the average values of the 9 measurements obtained at the stations
measured in the footprint of the HICOTM during the satellite’s overpass and on the
2 days beforehand. The HICOTM-derived R1.s values were extracted from 3 X 3 pixel
areas centred on the position of the in Sim measurements, as suggested by Patt (2002)
and Bailey and Werdell (2006). The in Sim R1.S are the average values of WISP-3 mea-
surements combined with the data gathered at the AERONET-OC AAOT station.
The modelled R1.S values were obtained from the forward run of the bio-optieal model
using in Sim data for the Chl-a, SPM and CDOM concentrations.

Overall, a good consistency was obtained across the spectrum, with a relative root
mean square error (RMSE) of 8% and 18%, respectively, when the modelled and
HICOTM data were compared with in Sim measurements. The HICOTM-derived R1.s

:0: 4. Conclusions
g A HICOTM image of the northern Adriatic Sea was acquired on 12 May 2012 and was
E used for assessing water-quality parameters. Physically-based methods were used to
3 convert the at-the-sensor radiance into R1.S values (HICO@CRI, Bassani er al. 2010)
E and to retrieve synchronous water-quality parameters from image data (BOMBER,
a Giardino er al. 2012). These methods were parameterised using in Sim measurements
a to Characterize both the optical properties of atmosphere and the speciﬁc inherent
3‘ optical properties of water.
'8 The performance of the proposed method was measured by comparing the R11S
23 values obtained by forward modelling, in Sim measurements and atmospherically cor-
Ti rected HICOTM data (including a correction for adjacent effects). The match of the
E RfS spectra was sufﬁcient for the purpose of this study, but further investigations are
D needed at the shortest wavelengths to obtain a better consistency of the HICOTM data.
This study conﬁrms that the HICOTM has a good enough SNR and spatial reso-
lution for assessing the complexity of coastal features, enabling local phenomena to
be distinguished. While we await the next generation of space-borne hyperspectral
imagers (e.g. SENTINELs, HYSPIRY, PRISMA, EnMap), the HICOTM facility has
given us an opportunity to simulate and verify the new sensors’ capabilities.
