In addition to the crew, microbes also find their way aboard the International Space
Station (188). Therefore, microbial monitoring is necessary for the health and safety of
the crew and for general maintenance of the facilities. Samples were collected from three
sites 011 the ISS (air difﬁaser, handrail, and surfaces) for analysis of fungal biota in the

J apanese Experimental Module KIBO approximately 1 year after it docked with the ISS.
Samples taken from KIBO before launch and from our laboratory were gathered for use
as controls. In the ease of KIBO, both Microbe Detection Sheet (MDS) and swab culture
tests for orbital samples were negative. MDS were also examined by ﬁeld
emission—seanning electron microscopy, but 110 microbial structures were detected.
However, fungal DNAs were detected by real—time PCR and analyzed by the clone
library method; Alternaria sp. and Malassezia spp. were the dominant species before
launch and in space, respectively. The dominant species in our laboratory as a ground
control at the air conditioner diffuser, lab bench, door push panel, and facility surfaces
were Inonotus sp., Cladosporium sp., Malassezia spp., and Pezicula sp., respectively.
The fungi in the KIBO were suggested to have been derived from contamination due to
humans, while they came from the environment (e.g., the soil) at our laboratory. In
conclusion, cleanliness at KIBO was equivalent to that in a clean room environment 011
the ground.

Keywords: clone library, fungal biota, International Space Station, Malassezia.

"4","Introduction

Several species of fungi were found aboard the Russian orbital station Mir, among which
microorganisms capable of colonization of the environment of manmade obj ects in space
as a unique anthrcpctechnclcgical niche were detected (1). The dominant species of fungi
detected on Mir and the United States space station Skylab belonged to the genera
Aspergillus, Penicillium, and Cladosporium (1, 2). On the ground, there have been some
reports of cases showing symptoms similar to allergic disease and sick building syndrome
among people living in places with heavy Aspergillus and Penicillium infestation (3). In a
56-day space stay simulation carried out by the US National Aeronautics and Space
Administration (NASA), the number and variety of ﬁangal isolates obtained from the
crew generally decreased, but the levels of Candida albicans and Candida tropicalis
increased markedly in the nasal and oral caVities (4). In the case of bacteria, the gene
expression pattern of Salmonella typhimurium was shown to change and the virulence of
the bacteria increased following spaceﬂight (5). Such variations may also occur in fungi.
Therefore, it is necessary to monitor fungal biota onboard the International Space Station
(188) to prevent such health disorders and equipment problems. The Japanese
Experimental Module (J EM), known as the “KIBO” (pronounced key-bow), which means
“hope” in J apanese, is the ﬁrst J apanese human-rated space facility and the ﬁrst
contribution by the J apan Aerc space Exploration Agency (J AXA) t0 the 188 program (6).
The new KIBO module is a suitable subj ect to investigate the fate of fungal biota in space.
In the present study, we analyzed the fungal biota 0f KIBO before launch and
approximately 460 days passed from June 2008 to September 2009 since it was connected
to the 188. This paper is part of Microbe-I report, which is the ﬁrst of three planned space
microbiological experiments to investigate the fate of fungal biota 0f KIBO.

Sampling

Samples were obtained using swabs (ITW Texwipe®; ITW Texwipe, Kernersville, NC)
and Microbe Detection Sheet (MDS) (Sani-ta kun for YEAST/MOLD; Chisso, Tokyo,

J apan). Swabs were moistened with 200 ttL 0f sterilized water, vacuum-paeked, and put
in plastic bags before use. The surface of the Cell Biology Experiment Facility (CBEF)
(smooth powder-eoated metal) ofKIBO before launch was swabbed (7 X 7 cm, 49 01112) at
John F. Kennedy Space Center (KSC) (Orlando, FL) 011 11 June 2007. The Japanese
Experiment Logistics Module, Pressurized Section (ELM-PS), and Pressurized Module
(PM) were launched on space shuttle missions Endeavour STS-123 (March 2008) and
Discovery STS-124 (May — June 2008). The Experiment Logistics Module, External
Section (ELM-ES), and ﬁnal components were launched on space shuttle mission
Endeavour STS-127 (July 2009). Sampling in orbit was performed by space shuttle
mission Discovery STS-128 (August — September 2009). The samples were gathered
from an air difﬁaser, handrail, and the surface of CBEF in the same way as before launch.
Swabs were placed in activated charcoal agar (Seed swab y-3; Eiken, Tokyo, J apan),
transferred and stored at 2°C from 188 to the laboratory. MDS were cultured at room
temperature (22°C) for 6 days (from ﬂight day 03 to day 09) at JEM (PM), 188, and
transferred from 188 with storage at 2°C to our laboratory. As ground-based controls, the
vertical surface of the facility (smooth powder-eoated metal, untouched by human
hands), door push plate (smooth, vertical resin routinely touched by people), lab bench
(smooth horizontal surface), and air conditioner diffuser were sampled using the same
methods in our laboratory.

Culture

Swabs were streaked and MDS were stamped onto DG-18 (Oxoid, Cambridge, UK) and
CHROMagarTM Malassezia/Candida (CHROMagar, Paris, France) (7) plates. The genus

"
"6","Malassezia consists of skin commensal yeast that causes pityriasis versicolor, seborrheie
dermatitis, atopic dermatitis, and Malassezia folliculitis (8). Therefore, Malassezia was
considered to be the target for the culture. All samples were incubated at 28°C and 37°C.
Electron Microscopy

After stereomieroscopic observation and stamping onto plates, MDS were ﬁxed for
electron microscopy as described previously (9) with some modiﬁcations as follows. All
samples were subjected to critical point drying, sputter-coated with osmium, and
observed using a ﬁeld emission—scanning electron microscope (FE-SEM) (J SM-7500F;
JEOL, Tokyo, J apan).

DNA extraction and Clone library

All reagents were used according to the respective manufacturer’s recommended
protocols. Swabs were streaked onto plates, and vortexed for 5 min with 1 mL of 0.05%
Tween 80. Aliquots of 30 ttL of DNA solution were extracted from 200 ttL 0f swab
suspension with NucliSens® Magnetic Extraction Reagents (BioMerieuX, Marcy l'Etoile,
France). Fungal ITSl DNA was ampliﬁed and detected from swabs using a panfungal
primer set and probe as described previously (10). Reactions were performed using
PremiX EX T aqTM (Perfect Real Time) (TaKaRa, Shiga, J apan). Real—time PCR was
performed with a 7500 Fast Real—Time PCR System (Applied Biosystems, Foster City,
CA). DNA fragments were ligated into the pCR2.1 vector (Invitrogen, Foster City, CA),
and the plasmids were introduced into competent Escherichia coli DHSOL cells (ECOSTM
Competent E. coli; Nippon Gene, Toyama, Japan). Clones were sequenced using the
vector universal M13 reverse primer with a BigDye Terminator V3.1 cycle sequencing kit
in an Applied Biosystems 373 0x1 DNA Analyzer (Applied Bio systems). Sequencing was
performed by the Dragon Genomics Center of TaKaRa Bio (Shiga, J apan). Rarefaetion
curves and Shannon diversity index estimates of operational taxonomic unit (OTU)
richness at over 97% similarity were calculated using the computer program EeoSim 7
(11).

"
"7","Idenﬁﬁcaﬂon

The isolated strains and DNA clones were identiﬁed by comparison with DNA sequences
registered in GenBank/EMBL/DDBJ as described previously (1).

Results

Culture

Culture results are shown in Table 1. In the 2-month culture, all orbital samples and the
surface of CBEF (before launch) were negative. Environmental fungi, such as Alternaria
tenuissima (FJ755240), Aspergillusfumigatus (FJ358278), Aspergillus oryzae
(HQ122941), Aureobasidium pullulans (GQ911487), Cladosporium cladosporioides
(GU214409), Didymella bryoniae (EU167573), Eupenicillium crustaceum (AB479289),
and Loratospom aestuarii (GU301838), were isolated from our laboratory as a
ground-based control. GenBank/EMBL/DDBJ accession numbers with 100% similarity
for pure isolates are shown in parenthesis.

Electron Microscopy

011 FE-SEM observation, neither cells or fragments of microbes nor human dust,
including hair or scurf, were observed 011 any of the MDS (data not shown).

Diversity and distribution of fungal IST1 sequences

Rarefaction curves (Fig. 1) were generated and the diversity indices at the 97% sequence
similarity level were calculated for the available ﬁmgal ITSl sequences in each clone
library (Table 2). The rarefaetion curves of each library tended to approach the saturation
plateau. The sequences of the clones in each library were aligned and compared as shown
in Table 3. Figure 2 shows fungal DNA level and diversity. Alternaria sp. was the
dominant species 011 the surface of CBEF before launching, but this changed to
Malassezia spp. in all orbital samples, and also 011 the door push plate 011 the ground. On
the other hand, the dominant species of ground-based control in the air conditioner

"
"8","difﬁaser, lab bench, door push panel, and surface of facilities were Inonotus sp.,
Cladosporium sp., Malassezia spp., and Pezicula sp., respectively.

Nucleotide sequence accession numbers

The internal transcribed spacer 1 partial sequences obtained in this study have been
deposited in GenBank/EMBL/DDBJ with the accession numbers AB632592 to

AB633 198.

Discussion

The 188 is a closed manned system exposed to microgravity and space radiation. It has
high-effioienoy particulate air (HEPA) ﬁlters to remove contaminants from the cabin
atmosphere (12), and is also cleaned weekly with a vacuum cleaner and 0.4%
benzalkonium chloride antiseptic towelettes (BZK Antiseptic Towelette; PDI 1110., New
York, NY). Cultures and FE-SEM observations were negative in all orbital samples.
Therefore, the HEPA seem to function normally on the 188. There was a significant
difference in quantity of DNA obtained from the lab bench (horizontal surface) and the
surface of the facility (vertical surface) of our ground-based laboratory. Dust falls in the
vertical plane, but lies thick on the horizontal plane, and it was therefore thought that the
ﬁmgal biota were different on the two similar smooth surfaces. 011 the other hand,
particles such as mold spores drift continuously under conditions of microgravity on the
ISS, and so there would be no significant differences in the biota according to the point of
collection. Alternaria sp. was the dominant species on the surface of the CBEF before
launch. A. alternata is an environmental fungus that is especially common in the soil (13),
and for which the temperature conditions at KSC in Florida are particularly suitable.
Therefore, soil ﬁmgal DNA was dominant before launch.

The observation that an environmental fungus was the dominant species was similar in
our laboratory except for the door push plate. These observations suggested that
environmental soil microbes inﬂuenced indoor ﬁmgal biota on the ground. On the other
hand, Malassezia spp. was the dominant species in orbital samples and on the door push

"
"9","plate. Dust did not attach to the door push plate or the facility surfaces as both were
smooth vertical planes. M restricta is lipophilio and oolonizes the human skin (14). Our
colleagues routinely touched the door push plate, but the facility surfaces are not exposed
to such contact, which is thought to explain the variation in ﬁJngal biota between these
two surfaces despite their similar smooth and vertical characteristics. The environmental
ﬁJngi of the 188 are derived from astronauts or other carriers, such as the space shuttle,
and soil is obViously not a significant source of fungal contamination. Although the 188
has a capacity of siX people, it held only three astronauts during the study period.
Therefore, the fungal activity would have been decreased because of limitations in
growth conditions moisture and nutrients such as sourf. Thus, Malassezia spp. derived
from human occupants of the 188 would be the dominant species in this artiﬁcial space
environment. Dead cells of Malassezia spp. or fragments that came from the crew were
detected that could not live in each sampling location. These results suggested that the
fungal biota of orbital samples would be similar to those of the door push plate on the
ground. The culture methods indicated that the dominant fungal species belonged to the
genera Aspergillus, Penicillium, and Cladosporium on both space station, Mir and Skylab
(1, 2). The results of the present study indicated that Cladosporium was the dominant
genus next to Malassezia in orbit. However, Cladosporium species were not detected by
the culture method because of their low levels of activity. Although our lab bench is
routinely exposed to contact with human skin, Malassezia sp. was minority in these
samples. Environmental fungi were active on the lab bench, and would digest the obligate
Malassezia spp., and this species may therefore be useful as an index of the myoologioal
hygiene of human living spaces.

In conclusion, the degree of cleanliness at KIBO, which was connected to the 188 for
about 460 days at the time of this study (June 2008 — September 2009), was equivalent to
that in a clean room environment on the ground. Fungi have already been detected from
the HEPA ﬁlters of the US module by culture and mold-speoifio quantitative PCR
methods (15). At present, the 188 houses siX crew members, and it will become a suitable
environment for fungal growth. Although no fungi were cultured in this Miorobe-I
mission from KIBO, fungal biota may be isolated in future. The further extension of our

"
"10","mission, Microbe-II & III, Will be conducted in future and Will clarify the state of the

KIBO fungal biota.
