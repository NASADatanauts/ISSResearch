Abstract

Biochips might be suited for planetary exploration. Indeed, they present great potentialities for the

search for biomarkers —molecules that are the sign of past or present life in space— thanks to their size

(miniaturized devices) and sensitivity. Their detection principle is based on the recognition of a target

molecule by afﬁnity receptors ﬁxed on a solid surface. As a consequence, one of the main concerns

when developing such a system is the behavior of the biological receptors in a space environment. In

this paper, we describe the preparation of an experiment planned to be part of the EXPOSE—RZ

mission, which will be conducted on the EXPOSE—R facility, outside the International Space Station

(ISS), in order to study the resistance of biochip models to space constraints (especially cosmic

radiation and thermal cycling). This experiment overcomes the limits of ground tests which do not

reproduce exactly the space parameters. Indeed, contrary to ground experiments where constraints are

applied individually and in a limited time, the biochip models on the ISS will be exposed to cumulated

constraints during several months. Finally, this ISS experiment is a necessary step towards planetary

exploration as it will help assessing whether a biochip can be used for future exploration missions.

Key words:

EXPOSE-R2 mission; ISS; biochip; antibodies and aptamers; space constraints; cosmic

radiation.

"3","1. Introduction

Several instruments based on the biochip technology are under development in the framework of
planetary exploration, in particular in the context of the search for signs of past life in our Solar
System. A biochip is a miniaturized device composed of molecular recognition tools (“affinity
receptors”) like antibodies or aptamers. It allows the detection of hundreds of different compounds in a
single assay. Many antibodies and aptaniers have already been produced to detect a wide variety of
targets from single molecules (including nucleotides, nucleosides, aminoacids, carbohydrates, etc...) to
complex mixtures or whole organisms (Nimjee er al. 2005; T ang, 2007). T wo space instruments based
on this technology and using antibodies are under development: the Life Marker Chip (LMC) (Sims er
al. 2012), and the Signs Of LIfe Detector (SOLID) (Parro er al. 2011).
Biochips are known to be very sensitive tools to detect speciﬁc target molecules and biochip
sensitivity is related to the presence of functional afﬁnity receptors ﬁxed on a solid substrate. In order
to develop a “space biochip”, it appears necessary to ensure that these biological receptors will survive
a full planetary mission. Interplanetary space is a hazardous environment, which combines wide
thermal cycles, extreme temperatures, microgravity, vacuum, severe radiations, etc. Moreover, a space
mission implies additional constraints such as contamination risks (need of sterilization procedures),
long storage times, Vibrations and shocks due to launching, landing and transportation. A biochip
dedicated to space should take into account all of those constraints and its design —initially that of a
regular biochip as used routinely on Earth— should therefore be adapted. In this context, the BiOMAS
(Biochip for Organic Matter Analysis in Space) proj ect proposes to study the feasibility of a space
biochip combining antibodies and aptamers (Le Postollec er al. 2007, Baque er al. 2011a,b).
Some studies have been carried out to test the resistance of a biochip—based instrument to different
space hazards like low gravity, energetic particle irradiation, thermal cycling, freeze—drying and long
time storage (Maule er al. 2003, T hompson er al. 2006, Le Postollec er al. 2009b, Baque er al.
2011a,b, de Diego—Castilla er al. 2011, Derveni er al. 2012). The main limitation of these works is that
each constraint is generally studied individually and for a limited period of time that is not
representative of a real space mission. In particular, the effect of cosmic rays is generally studied at a
given energy (or a limited range of energies) and for one type of particle in a single experiment. Only
one study has been carried out in conditions closer to space missions ones: some biochip reagents have
ﬂown on BIOPAN—6 platform, experiencing LEO (Low Earth Orbit) environment during few days
(Derveni er al. 2013). Unfortunately, irradiation conditions encountered during this short time
experiment (12 days) were still far from those expected for a mission to Mars. In particular, the
ionizing dose received by samples was consequently too low. In order to overcome previous works
limitations, we suggest testing the resistance of a biochip model outside the International Space
Station (ISS) during a long time period (several months).

2

"
"4","An experiment outside the ISS is a relevant test to argue for the use of a biochip on new upcoming
space missions for several reasons. Irradiation conditions will be closer to those that the biochip will
face during a real mission than conditions usually applied on ground tests. The biological components
will be submitted to a combination of cosmic and solar particles with a predominance of protons and
accumulated ionizing doses will be in the same order of magnitude than those simulated for a biochip
aboard a typical mission to Mars (Le Postollec er al. 2009a, McKenna—Lawlor er al. 2012). Exposure
duration will be very long (from 12 to 18 months) and therefore dose debits will be slower than on
beam facilities, which can inﬂuence the components behavior. Moreover, along with irradiation,
samples will face thermal cycles, launch constraints, Vibrations, storage delays, etc. This will be very
representative of real conditions and it will give crucial data about their resistance against these
different factors to develop a future prototype of biochip for space purposes.
In the present paper, we describe the preparati on process for the experiment that we will perform
outside the ISS to study the resistance of a biochip—based instrument to space constraints. This
experiment will use the EXPOSE—R facility, which is presented in section 2. Section 3 details the
composition and the conditioning of our samples. The experimental preparation procedure for the
biochip models is described in section 4. The list of controls designed to evaluate the relative
signiﬁcance/effect of each space mission parameter is given in section 5. A particular attention will be
paid to cosmic rays. For that reason, dosimeters will be attached to the samples in order to evaluate the
total dose accumulated during the mission, as presented in section 6.
2. The EXPOSE-R facility
2.] Presentation of the EXPOSE-R facility
EXPOSE—R is an ESA (European Space Agency) facility intended to be located on the International
Space Station (ISS). The core facility will be placed outside the ISS on the Universal Platform D
(URM—D platform) of the Russian module Zvezda (Figure 1A). This facility is intended for scientists
willing to perform long term exposure of a given biological or chemical compound to open space
environment (combination of radiation from the Sun, cosmic particle radiation, vacuum, temperature
variations, microgravity,...). The EXPOSE—R2 mission (2014) uses the core facility of previous
missions (EXPOSE, EXPOSE—R) (see for instance Cottin er al., 2008, Rabbow er al., 2009, Bryson er
al., 2011, Cottin er al., 2012, Rabbow er al., 2012) but with modiﬁed or added features. It will
accommodate a Russian experiment designed by the Institute for Biomedical Problems (IBMP) of
Moscow and three European scientiﬁc experiments: BIOlogy and Mars Experiment (BIOMEX),
Biofilm Organisms Surﬁng Space (B 088) and Photochemistry on the Space Station (PSS). T hese
astrobiology experiments all aim at evaluating the evolution of organic molecules or at measuring to
3

"
"5","what extent some Chemical, biological or biochemical samples are resistant to long term exposure to
the space environment. Our “Biochip ” experiment is part of the PSS experiment.

2.2 Description ofEXPOSE-R design
In the frame of EXPOSE—R2 mission, the EXPOSE—R facility consists in three removable trays
(Figure 1B), each one of them being composed of 4 stainless steel sample carriers that are similar to
those from previous missions (EXPOSE—E and —R) but include new improvement features. T hree
sample carriers have been dedicated to the PSS experiment and, on every sample carrier (Figure 1C),
up to 20 samples can be accommodated for the moment. If conﬁrmed by ESA, the ﬁnal design will
allow accommodating 25 samples per sample carrier. The samples are spread into two layers so that
they will be irradiated behind two different levels of shielding giving the opportunity to study two
different levels of irradiation doses. A cell is a cylindrical stainless steel container of about lcm
diameter. The Closed cells are made of two cylindrical bodies (Figure 1 D, E, G) which can be screwed
one into the other with a seal inside the cell (o—ring) to prevent leaks (Figure 1 F). Both parts of the
cell have been identiﬁed with a laser inscription (Figure 1 G). Sixteen integrally Closed cells made of
stainless steel will be dedicated to the Biochip proj ect (8 cells at each layer). Biochip cells have been
designed integrally Closed — i.e. without any window — in order to protect samples from UV exposure.

3. ISS sample characteristics

3.] Description ofBiochip samples
Cells dedicated to the Biochip experiment contain a bio—molecule, either an antibody or an aptamer
(B aque er al. 2011a,b). In terms of space biochip development, those afﬁnity receptors were Chosen
for their capability to recognize biochemical compounds (amino acids, peptides, proteins,
carbohydrates, oligonucleotides, etc) even when only traces are available, thanks to their high level of
speciﬁcity and affinity (Nimj ee er al. 2005, T ang er al. 2007). Such detection systems were previously
Challenged concerning their resistance to radiations, storage and freeze—drying (Le Postollec er al.
2007, Le Postollec er al. 2009a,b, Baque er al. 2011a,b, De Diego—Castilla er al. 2011, Derveni er al.
2012, Derveni er al. 2013). In a real mission, afﬁnity receptors can be used either grafted on a support
or free in solution as in the case of LMC and SOLID proj ects. T herefore, their resistance to space
constraints under these two forms will be studied.
One specific antibody and one speciﬁc aptamer were Chosen as models in the Biochip experiment. The
anti—horseradish peroxidase (HRP) antibody was selected for the following reasons: it is a model
antibody whose analysis is easily performed (Baque er al. 2011a) and well known from biochemists, it
is Cheap and delivery times are short. The aptamer Chosen for the ISS mission is an anti—tyrosinamide

4

"
"6","DNA aptamer labeled with ﬂuorescein that was previously successfully used to evaluate the
irradiation effect (B aque er al. 2011b).
The samples are freeze—dried during their preparation because it is less challenging to send dry
samples to space than samples in solution and also to optimize their stability through time (pre—launch
storage and long term mission). Indeed, antibodies are known to be quite stable for long time storage
when they are freeze—dried (Chang et al. 2005, Wang et al. 2007).
As it was previously mentioned (section 2.2), 16 cells will be allocated to the Biochip experiment —
spread equally 0n the 2 exposure levels— so that each sample is present in either 2 0r 3 replicates on
each exposure level (Figure 2). All 8 biochip model samples will be gathered at one location on the
sample carrier because radiation gradients were observed in previous ISS missions (Berger et al.,
2012).
3.2 Description of the sample depositing surface
The samples (antibodies or aptamers) are not placed directly into the steel cell but they are deposited
in a polystyrene container called a micro—well (Figure 3A, 3B). The polymer surface at the bottom of
the micro—well is used for fixing the sample. Also, the micro—well is associated with a T eﬂon cap and
both ensure the sample protection (n0 contamination) and an optimal recovery (n0 sample loss).
T 0 ﬁt within the ﬁnal sample container (the cell), the design of the well has to meet special dimension
requirements. When comparing the design of the EXPOSE—R2 cells (Figure 3C) to that of a regular
micro—well on a commercial 96—well plate (Figure 3A, 3B), we can see that the well could ﬁt within
the Closed cell if its height was reduced. We thus use individual micro—wells from commercial strip—
well plates (Figure 3A) to which we perform an additional machining to reduce its height. (Figure 3B).
3.2. 1 Preparation of the sample depositing surface
Many commercial surfaces are available for the grafting of bio—molecules such as antibodies and
aptamers, each surface with its own binding properties (covalent bond, adsorption, afﬁnity). The
surface is a key parameter in the development of a biochip as it strongly conditions the biochip final
properties (sensitivity, stability, etc.) (Moreau er al. 2011, Moreau er al. 2013). Several studies
demonstrated that the covalent grafting of antibodies using polystyrene micro—wells covered by N—
HydroxySuCCinimide ester functions (NHS) is efﬁcient (Baque er al. 2011a, Moreau er al. 2011,
Moreau er al. 2013). In addition, Baque er al. 2011 and Moreau er al. 2013 showed that these surfaces
are suitable to evaluate the biochip performance after exposure to space—related constraints.
Even though we have both samples grafted on a surface (covalent link) or samples free in solution (no
link), we chose to use the same well type for all samples for convenient matters. T herefore, NHS
functions have to be neutralized for non—grafted samples (free antibodies and free aptamers) to prevent
5

"
"7","any interaction. We chose to block the NHS functions using BSA before adding the free antibody
samples (Figure 4). For aptamer samples, NHS functions are hydrolyzed rather than covered by BSA
in order to avoid any interaction between the positively charged proteins and the negatively charged
aptamers.
3.2.2 Control Of the machined wells
Using wells with reduced height does not imply a change in common laboratory equipment and
procedures. Nevertheless, the machining step that is carried out for well cutting might affect the
quality of the commercial surface, whose functions are essential for antibody grafting but strongly
sensitive to air exposure (humidity). When NHS—functions hydrolysis occurs, the level of antibody
covalent grafting is reduced (Moreau er al. 2011). T 0 assess that machining does not affect surface
reactivity, two series of measurements were performed. First, the grafting results of machined surfaces
and new surfaces were compared. The amount of grafted antibody is identical indicating that
machining doesn’t reduce signiﬁcantly the surface performances (data not shown). T hen, intra—batch
variability was evaluated to check that surface performances were preserved for all of the batch
samples after machining with a number of samples that is consistent with the ISS mission. T we
surface features were controlled: the physical properties (for instance, a modiﬁcation in optical
properties could affect blank values) and the biochemical properties (a modification in the surface
chemistry could affect the biochip sensitivity). All results (T able 1) show that no general quality loss
was observed on any of the functionalized wells after machining so that surface properties are not
affected by the machining process (providing that wells do not stay too long in contact with air).
Finally we checked that the biochip performances —and especially the percentage of damaged antibody
that can be measured— were not affected by the reduction in sample volume (as implied by height
reduction) (data not shown).
For free antibodies and free aptamers, two assays were carried out (data not shown) to control that the
use of modified NHS—surfaces gives results identical to those obtained with non activated surfaces as
regularly used (Baque er al. 2011 a, b).
NHS surfaces (modiﬁed or not) are therefore well adapted for all samples preparation.
4. Experimental procedure for biochip models preparation

Biochip models preparation includes successively well preparation (see section 4.1), sample
preparation (see section 4.2), freeze—drying step (section 4.3), and samples conditioning (section 4.4).
Additional steps that are not performed by our team are brieﬂy presented in section 4.5.

6

"
"8","4.] Well preparation
This step includes height reduction of the commercial wells, surface preparation (function
neutralization) and identiﬁcation.

4.1.] Well machining
The functionalized wells used for biochip models preparation are obtained from VWlVSigma—Aldrich
(DNA Bind Stripwell Plate — N-hydroxysuccinimide modified surface - Costar® Coming). The
machining (height reduction) is performed by Air Liquide (Sassenage, France) as follows: the
aluminum pouch containing commercial micro—plates under slight vacuum with neutral gas is opened
just before the cutting process. T hen, wells are removed from their support, dissociated and cutting
process is performed, one well at a time (Figure 3B). During the Whole cutting process, air humidity
content is controlled, and wells are placed on a lint—free paper to prevent any surface degradation
(NHS hydrolysis and/or scratching 0f the well). Once the process is complete, the wells are
immediately placed back on their support, then in their pouch Which is conditioned with nitrogen gas
and heat—sealed. Sixty siX wells have been cut at the same time in order to have the same cutting
conditions for wells used for exposed samples, for all controls (see section 5), for the qualiﬁcation
procedure requested by BSA and for some spares. For the 66 wells needed for this ISS experiment, the
whole machining process is performed Within two hours.

4.1.2 Well identiﬁcation
The identiﬁcation of samples and wells is a critical point that is Checked throughout the whole sample
preparation and conditioning process in order to prevent results misinterpretation after ISS samples
return. Several quality controls are performed in order to prevent well confusion. First, prior to the use
of the machined wells, each of them is identiﬁed on its Circumference using an extra thin permanent
marker. Indeed, mechanic printing would be too long for individual identiﬁcation with regard to
Chemistry moisture sensitivity. The correspondence between the well, its content and the cell are
reported on several procedures that are kept by all partners at different locations, both on printed and
electronic documents.

4.2 Sample preparation
Immediately after opening and identifying, wells are submitted to sample preparation (grafted
antibodies, free antibodies or aptamers) following their respective procedures.

7

"
"9","4. 2. I Grafted antibodies preparation
The following grafting protocol was adapted from Baque er al. (2011a). Monoclonal anti—peroxidase
antibodies are obtained from MyBioS ource, US A. PBS (Phosphate Buffer Saline) is obtained from
Euromedex, France (10X solution, pH 7.4, 10'2M, diluted in pure water to obtain 1X ﬁnal solution),
BSA (Bovin Serum Albumine, fraction V, 96—100% protein), T ween® 20 and sodium azide are
obtained from Sigma—Aldrich, France. The antibody solution at 200pg/mL is prepared by dilution of
the commercial solution (5.6 mg/mL) in a PBS 1X buffer containing 0.05% sodium azide. Antibody
grafting is performed in one—step (Figure 4) by adding 100 pL of this solution per well and leaving
overnight at room temperature under smooth agitation using a micro—plate agitator (T itramaX, VWR,
France), and followed with a washing step Where wells are washed ﬁve times with PBS buffer
containing 0.05% T ween®20 (PBST) and twice with PBS. T hen, saturation is performed using 150 pL
of a 3% BSA solution in PBS with 0.09% sodium azide during 2h at room temperature and followed
by the same washing sequence as for antibodies.

4.2.2 F ree antibodies preparation
Free antibody samples are prepared in two steps (Figure 4). First the surface is blocked and then
antibodies are deposited into the wells. BSA is used as the blocking agent in the same way saturation
is performed for grafted antibodies. The antibody solution at 200pg/mL is prepared by dilution of the
commercial solution (5.6 mg/mL) directly in the freeze—drying buffer Which composition is detailed in
Baque er al. (2011a), and 100 “L are added to each well.

4.2.3 Aptamers preparation
Aptamer samples are prepared in two steps (Figure 4). First the surface is hydrolyzed and then the
aptamers are deposited into the wells. Carbonate buffer (0.1M, pH 9.4) is used for hydrolysis: 150 pL
are added per well and left overnight at room temperature under smooth agitation using a micro—plate
agitate . T hen wells are washed ﬁve times with ultra pure water. Sodium carbonate and sodium
bicarbonate are obtained from Acros, France. The aptamer solution at 500 nM is prepared by dilution
of the commercial solution in water as described in Baque er al. (2011b) and 100 pL are added to each
well.

4.3 Freeze-drying

8

"
"10","Liquid volumes spotted on commercial biochips are so small that water evaporates instantaneously
and freeze—drying step is not necessary (like for the maj ority 0f microarrays studied by de Diego—
Castilla er 611.). However, as this experiment is performed with wells, the liquid volumes considered
are much bigger and freeze drying step appears unavoidable.

4. 3.] Sample preparation for freeze-drying
Antibodies in solution in water suffer during freeze—drying (exposure to very low temperatures and
desiccation) (Wang et al. 2007). A freeze—drying buffer has been developed to limit antibodies
physical or Chemical degradation during the freeze—drying step. Its composition (including
components, pH and additives) is described in Baque er al. (2011a). Aptamers, however, are less
sensitive to freeze—drying and they are simply diluted and freeze—dried in ultra—pure water.
Free antibodies and aptamers are diluted directly in their freeze—drying buffer (respectively freeze—
drying buffer and ultra—pure water) but for grafted antibodies it is necessary to add the freeze—drying
buffer after the saturation step (120 pL per well).

4. 3. 2 F reeze-drying procedure
This step is performed using a freeze—dryer (Christ Alpha 2—4), a sealing device and an aluminum case
that was especially designed for the experiment to guarantee optimal stability of freeze—dried samples
without affecting the freeze—drying process (Figure 5). Indeed, we have observed that a loss of activity
occurs after the freeze—drying step which is due to rapid rehydration 0f the dry samples with air
humidity. We thus limit samples damages after freeze—drying by isolating the freeze—dried samples
within the Closed case before removing them from the interior of the freeze—dryer (up to 15% less
degradation).
After being cooled down with the liquid nitrogen, the wells on their support are placed in the case and
then on the sealing device shelf in the open conﬁguration (Figure 5). It is left overnight at —800C and
0.05 mbar and then removed from the freeze—dryer as follows: when the freeze—drying process is
complete, the Chamber of the freeze—dryer is ﬁlled with nitrogen gas to limit the contact with
humidity—Charged air, and using the sealing device, the sample—containing case is shut before
removing from the Chamber.

4.4 Conditioning
As described hereafter, the samples are conditioned in hermetically Closed cells ﬁlled with a mixture
of helium and argon and ﬁxed on a supporting device that is placed in a tube to secure transportation.

9

"
"11","All conditioning tools (well caps, cells, cell screwing socket, cell supporting devices and transport
tubes) are manufactured and provided by Air Liquide (Sassenage, France). Cells (both half parts) and
transport tubes are engraved with laser for identiﬁcation. Following delivery in lab, all tools are
Cleaned and stored in proper conditions that prevent any contamination.
4. 4.] Integration of samples within cells
When removed from the freeze—dryer, the sample—containing case is opened in a glove box pre—
equilibrated with a mixture of inert gas made of 10% helium in argon (Air Liquide, France). Such gas
mixture was Chosen because following its conditioning the cell integrity will be controlled with helium
leak tests.
Once inside the box, the freeze—dried samples can equilibrate to room temperature in a dry atmosphere
(gas mixture contains H20 < 3ppn1 and, after box equilibration, relative humidity <15%) so that no
condensation occurs.
After opening the case, the sample—containing wells are covered one by one with a T eﬂon cap using a
vacuum suction pen (Figure 6A). T hen the capped wells are picked one at a time and placed in the
corresponding cell taking good care to match perfectly the right sample to the right cell according to
well and cell respective identification. Note that the cells are opened within the glove box prior to
equilibration with gas to ensure that they contain no trace of humidity detrimental for the dry samples.
For a more convenient manipulation inside the glove box, ﬁne—tip tweezers are used (Figure 6B).
Following well addition, the cells are Closed partly manually (Figure 6C) and partly using a screwing
socket combined with a torque wrench (Figure 6D). To ensure that they are all screwed properly and
identically, the ﬁnal tightening is performed at a given torque of 0.7 Nm. At that step, the cells are on
a supporting device to make their manipulation and shipment easier.
Once all cells are closed, each supporting device is taken out of the glove box and placed within a
transport tube which is filled with a mixture of argon and helium and hermetically Closed.
4.4.2 F inal sample conditioning and storage

Once conditioning is complete, the transport tubes are stored in a fridge at +4OC waiting for ﬁnal
conditioning.
The final conditioning is performed by Air Liquide by taking out the cells from their tube and welding
with laser the male and female parts together in order to make the cell completely tight. Before and
after welding, helium leak tests are performed to Check for cell integrity. Finally, cell supporting

10

"
"12","devices are placed back in transport tubes; the tubes are ﬂushed with gas and stored in the lab
(Montpellier, France) in a dedicated fridge at +4OC.

4.5 Data on samples preservation
Several experiments have been performed on ground to ensure that the preparation process preserves
grafted antibodies performances. The behavior of samples has been also studied through long time
storage and varying thermal environment.
Grafted antibodies activity loss after the freeze—drying step (using the speciﬁc aluminum case) was
determined around 20% (5 different tests with 5 repetitions each time). Preservation of samples during
long time storage was studied with several samples stored in a fridge at 40C. SiX tests were performed
along one year and they demonstrate that the performance loss remains under 15% after 12 months
storage (Moreau er al. 2013). We can notice that the ﬂight samples are stored under inert gas whereas
samples tested were just sealed in a plastic bag, therefore the preservation of functionality will
certainly be better for ﬂight samples. T hermal shifts from —10°C to +450C were applied to antibodies
samples in order to assess their behavior under the different thermal shifts that they could face during
transport and manipulation on Earth and during the ﬂight. We measured an activity loss of 16%
(Moreau er al. 2013). T hanks to our several studies, we know that we can precisely measure samples
activity until 91% of reduction. T herefore, samples are still perfectly acceptable to be exposed to harsh
space conditions after the unavoidable activity reduction due to preparation steps, storage and
transport.

4.6 Additional steps before loading on the ISS
Before sample delivery to BSA, cells will be transferred from their initial supportng device to the
corresponding sample carriers, either ground sample carriers or ﬂight sample carriers. T hat step is
performed at LISA (Laboratoire Interuniversitaire des Systemes Atmospheriques, Paris, France) under
the responsibility of the PSS experiments leader. Sample carriers will be loaded on trays at MUSC —
DLR (Microgravity User Support Center, Cologne, Germany) and trays will be Closed with the
appropriate gas conditions and transported to launch site (Baikonour, Kazakhstan). Finally, samples
will be shipped to the ISS using Progress spacecraft. Once there, the trays will be installed into
EXPOSE—R core facility and stored within the ISS for a few weeks at maximum. T hen, EXPOSE—R
will be placed at outer surface of the ISS 0n the Universal platform D.

5. Controls

"
"13","5.] Ground controls
Ground controls correspond to the samples that stay on Earth during the whole ISS mission. T hey
follow the same preparing process than ISS samples in the lab and almost the same transporting
process except that they don’t go all the way to the launching site but stay in the German Aerospace
Center (DLR) after sample uploading on trays. T hey will thus be used as references when analyzing
the ISS samples returning from space. T wo types of ground controls are prepared (T able 2). One will
be kept at +4OC, as a reference for the combination of all space constraints. Another control called the
mission ground reference (MGR) will be exposed to thermal cycling as Close as possible to that of the
ﬂight samples. The temperature cycles will be deﬁned based on data collected on the ISS during
EXPOSE—R2 mission so that MGR samples undergo the same thermal history as ISS samples, almost
instantaneously (data processing time).

5.2 Presentation oflab controls
We Chose to have additional controls apart from the 2 ground controls already mentioned. Indeed, due
to a limited amount of samples that can be exposed on the ISS, only 16 samples are allocated to the
Biochip experiment, equally spread on both exposure levels. Each sample type is thus available in
only 2 or 3 replicates (T able 2). It is very important that we are able to interpret the ﬁnal analysis
results despite the low number of samples, hence we need to have a way to control every critical step
of the mission.
T wo types of lab controls are prepared corresponding to 2 critical steps of the mission: preparation,
and transport (T able 2). They are all prepared, stored and transported in parallel to the ﬂight samples
so that their analyses give precious information on the ﬂight samples condition at a given moment.
Preparation controls are “to” controls which must ensure that samples preparation went well, and that
ISS samples quality was not affected by preparation. The results of preparation controls analysis will
condition the acceptance or rej ection of the prepared set. In case of lot rej ection, a new lot will have to
be prepared.
T ransport controls tell us in what condition the samples are before launching and in what extent they
have been affected by transportation throughout all transportation steps from the laboratory to the
launching site. The results of transport controls analysis do not condition the following of the mission
but have an informative nature.
The controls are only prepared for antibodies samples. Indeed, aptamers are known to be extremely
stable to temperature variations (which will be the main transport constraint) and their preparation
only includes two steps, thus limiting the risks of degradation (Baque et al. 2011b). Controls go
through the whole preparation procedure to gether with ISS samples. Preparati on controls are analyzed

12

"
"14","right away after sample preparation. T ransport controls are integrated within cells and transports tubes.
T hey are transported to launching site in the same conditions as ISS ﬂight samples and then shipped
back to the laboratory for storage. The analysis of transport controls will be performed in parallel to
the ISS ﬂight samples, at the end of the mission.
The time course of our experiment, from samples and controls preparation to ﬁnal analysis is
illustrated in Figure 7.

5.3 Analysis Of lab controls
Sample rehydration must be done instantaneously after cell opening. For preparation controls, a
biochemical analysis is performed following the protocol published by Baqué er al. (2011a) (antibody
direct ELISA or antibody competitive analyses) and by Baque er al. (2011b) and Ruta er al. (2009)
(aptamer analysis). Results obtained with lab control samples are compared to their respective lab
reference value: the activity of grafted antibodies must be above 30 ng of HRP and the IC50 (half
maximal inhibitory concentration) of free antibodies must be less than Spg/ml. T hose criteria are
based on the following requirement: any result that we Wish to analyze must be greater than the limit
of quantiﬁcation (minimum level of interaction that can be detected and quantiﬁed). The criteria also
include a margin that was determined based on our knowledge of the level of degradation for each
critical step. Conclusions drawn from preparation control analyses are generalized to all samples and
they condition whether the ISS samples (ﬂight and ground samples) can follow on the mission.

6. Dosimetry

6. 1 Interest ofdosimetry measurement for the experiment
One of the main obj ectives of this experiment is to study the ionizing radiation impact on our samples.
Indeed, ionizing radiation can induce local damages to bio—molecular targets (such as DNA) through
local energy deposition (see for eg. Cucinotta er al. 2003). At the International Space Station Low—
Earth orbit, the main contribution arises from primary trapped protons and GCRs, as well as from
secondary protons and neutrons. X—rays are usually considered as negligible in View of other incident
particles ﬂuences (Ersmark 2006). Fluences in LOW—Earth Orbit have been recently simulated by
Matthia er al. (2013a) using a realistic galactic cosmic ray model (Matthia er al. 2013b) for the
dominant species (H, He, C and Fe); the largest ﬂuences are obtained for H and He, while ﬂuences for
C and Fe are smaller by several orders of magnitude. A more speciﬁc simulation is under development
to assess the ionizing dose that the EXPOSE—R facility and the biochip cells will receive during the

13

"
"15","exposition phase of the present mission. T hese simulations use the GEANT 4 tool (Agostinelli et al.,
2003; Allison et al., 2006).
However, simulations are interesting but they need to be confronted with real measurements.
T herefore, to assess the impact of ionizing radiation on our samples, it is necessary to Characterize as
accurately as possible the radiation environment that they will encounter during the mission.
T we types of radiation dosimetry measurements will be performed on the EXPOSE—R platform.
An active sensor package called R3D, for Radiation Risks Radiometer—Dosimeter, will provide some
active dosimetry data for the whole platform. R3D instrument is adapted from similar sensor packages
used during previous EXPOSE missions (DaCheV er al. 2012). It will provide the history of the
accumulated radiation dose (pGy/h), the total dose (Gy), the particle ﬂux (particles/cmZ/s) and the
particle ﬂuences with different deposition energies.
T hanks t0 the German Aerospace Center (DLR) expertise in space dosimetry, the Biochip experiment
will beneﬁt from passive dosimetry measurements performed as Close as possible to our samples.
T hese different dosimetry measurements will be a precious help to interpret results when samples will
be back on Earth as they will give data on the homogeneity of radiations among all the cells (and all
the samples). We will have a good assessment of the difference of radiation level between the upper
and the lower tray. We will also be able to determine possible gradients in radiation exposures among
the cells of a same tray.
6.2 Thermoluminescent dosimeters (TLD)
T hermoluminescent dosimeters will be used to estimate the dose received by samples. T hese
dosimeters are made of 7LiF with Mg and T i dopants and are provided by T hermo Fisher Scientiﬁc,
Inc. (Ohio, USA) under the trade name T LD—700. One of the main advantages of those detectors is
their small size as they only measure 32 X 3.2 X 0.9 mm (Figure 8).
T hey will provide the global dose absorbed during the whole mission. Indeed, the dosimeter stores the
energy captured from ionizing radiations in the crystal lattice defects, and releases it as light when
heated during laboratory readout. The amount of light is correlated to the radiation exposure. Such
dosimeters have already been used on EXPOSE—E facility (B erger er al. 2012). All the T LDs used for
our experiment are calibrated and provided by the Institute of Aerospace Medicine of the German
Aerospace Center (DLR) which will also perform the post—ﬂight analysis.
6.3 Thermoluminescent dosimeter locations on the sample carrier

T LDs will be integrated in 3 different locations: within the cells, directly in the sample carrier core and
beneath the sample carriers.

14

"
"16","T we T LDs will be placed in each cell, under the well containing samples. Figure 8 shows the design
of the cell bottom which has been machined to offer two speciﬁc adapted locations for the two
dosimeters. As they are very Close to the sample, they will give a very good estimate of the ionizing
dose received.
Also, special holes will be drilled into the sample carrier core to host T LD stacks. Indeed, some
columns of eight stacked T LDs will be integrated between cells (Figure 2) in order to assess radiation
distribution in depth.
Finally, some dosimetry modules composed of T LDs and CR39 ﬁlms will be integrated beneath the
sample carriers to determine the dose levels for maximum shielding.
6.4 Thermoluminescent dosimeters integration
T LDs are provided in plastic holders and each T LD is identiﬁed by its position in the holder map. The
dosimeters are integrated in the cells during sample conditioning within a glove box. All of the cells,
including the ISS samples and controls, will contain a pair of dosimeters. T 0 proceed with their
integration, they are grabbed with fine tip tweezers and placed in the respective cell following an
integration map. At the bottom of the cell, a punch is made at one of the 2 T LD locations during cell
manufacturing to differentiate them (Figure 8). This allows placing every dosimeter back in its
original position in the plastic holder at the end of the mission. Indeed, each dosimeter has its own
speciﬁc calibration factor and should be well identiﬁed all along the mission. Once dosimeters are
positioned at the bottom of the cell, the sample integration can be carried out.
7. Conclusion

In the present paper, we present the preparation of the Biochip experiment which will be part of the
PSS experiment aboard the ISS using the EXPOSE—R facility. For this experiment, two types of
biological samples were selected: a model antibody and a model aptamer. The optimized conditioning
consists in adding them to a small container under the freeze—dried form. After validation (acceptance)
of the prepared batch, the samples will be stored in a controlled atmosphere, waiting launching. Once
on the ISS, the samples will undergo different levels of exposure to space constraints (in particular
different levels of cosmic radiations). Both the preparation and analysis procedure optimizations are
now complete and the samples are ready to ﬂy. EXPOSE—R2 mission should be launched in April
2014 and it is intended to last for around 2 years including 12 to 18 months of exposure outside the
ISS. The scientiﬁc obj ective is to test the resistance of the biochip models to cumulated space
constraints. Indeed, even though ground experiments are useful for evaluating the impact of a given
space constraint on a biochip—based instrument, it does not take into account the cumulative effect of
all constraints.

15

"
"17","Nevertheless, both types of experiments (carried on Earth and on 188) are very useful as they can help
the scientiﬁc community to optimize the use of a biochip—based instrument for space exploration by
developing adapted protections.
