Heartbeat oscillations in complex plasmas With a broad range of fundamental frequencies are
observed and studied. The experiments are performed with monodisperse microparticles of
different diameters in argon as well as in neon plasmas. The oscillation frequency increases With
increasing rf power and neutral gas pressure. At the lower frequencies, oscillations are strongly
nonlinear. The microparticle pulsations, the variation of the electrical discharge parameters and the
spatially resolved changes in the plasma glow are proven to be strongly correlated. Heartbeat
oscillation dynamics is associated with global conﬁnement modes. © 20]] American Institute of
